Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour including remarks by Mondel\u0113z's management and the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dexter Congbalay, Vice President Investor Relations for Mondel\u0113z International. Please go ahead, sir. Dexter Congbalay : Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. With me are Irene Rosenfeld, our Chairman and CEO and Dave Brearton, our CFO. Earlier today, we issued two news releases; one detailing our first quarter earnings and financial improved profitability and another on our intention to combine our coffee business with D.E Master Blenders. These releases and today's slides are available on our website, mondelezinternational.com. As you know, during this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Irene. Irene Rosenfeld :  Thanks Dexter and good morning. We launched Mondel\u0113z International in October 2012. We set out to create a global snacking powerhouse that will deliver top tier financial performance and be a great place to work. Since our launch we\u2019ve made good progress in many areas. We have grown our market shares fueled by investments behind our power brands and innovation platforms. We strengthened our geographic footprint and route to market capabilities. We stepped up cost reductions in both our supply chain and in overheads to drive margin expansion and we strengthened our balance sheet while significantly boosting cash returns to shareholders through both share repurchase and higher dividends. But despite these many accomplishments we are not where we should be at this point in our journey. The recent global slowdown in our categories has tempered our near-term top-line growth as well as that of our peers\u2019. This slowdown has made it imperative that we act more quickly and more aggressively to address the inefficiencies in our cost structure. So today we are taking too both steps, both to improve our near-term results and to increase confidence that we will deliver sustainable top tier financial performance over the long-term. First, we\u2019re focusing our portfolio even further on snacks, by combining our coffee business with D.E Master Blenders 1753 to create the world\u2019s leading pure play coffee company. Second, we\u2019re setting up and accelerating our cost reduction efforts to deliver best in class costs in both our supply chain and in overheads. Together, these actions will enable us to become an even more focused and nimble global snacking powerhouse; to achieve world class margins faster, to simplify how we work around the world, to speed up and clarify decision making and to generate the fuel to invest more in our people, in our brands and in our executional capabilities. All of this will help us deliver superior returns to our shareholders. I\u2019ll take the next few minutes to discuss these strategic initiatives in more detail. Let me start with the coffee transaction. We intend to combined our nearly $4 billion coffee business with D.E Master Blenders to create the world\u2019s leading pure-play coffee company. This new company will have annual revenues of more than $7 billion and an EBITDA margin in the high-teens. It will bring together our portfolios of iconic brands, our complementary geographic footprints and our innovative technologies to transform two strong businesses into an even stronger one. The combined company will feature our market leading brands like Jacobs and Tassimo and Douwe Egberts and Senseo from D.E Master Blenders. The combined company can be called Jacobs Douwe Egberts will have an advantage position in the $81 billion global coffee category including leading market shares in more than two dozen countries and a sizable footprint in all key emerging markets. With greater focus and increased scale, the new company can operate more efficiently and invest more effectively in innovation, manufacturing and market development to capitalize on the significant growth opportunities in coffee. When we close this transaction, we\u2019ll receive after-tax cash proceeds of approximately $5 billion and a 49% interest in the combined company. Our partner, Acorn Holdings is the current owner of D.E Master Blenders and will have a 51% interest in the combined company, as well as the majority of seats on the Board. Acorn is owned by an investor group led by [JAV] Holdings Company, an investment vehicle managed by three highly respected senior partners with whom we\u2019re delighted to team. Bart Becht, the former CEO of Reckitt Benckiser and current Chairman of D.E Master Blenders. Peter Harf, a former senior executive at InBev, Reckitt and [Cody]. And Olivier Goudet, the former CFO of Mars. While Becht will be Chairman of the new combined company, Pierre Laubies, the current CEO of D.E Master Blenders is the perspective CEO of the new company. The other members of his leadership team will be joined from both coffee businesses using a best-of-both approach. The deal is expected to close in the course of 2015 subject to limited closing conditions. During the interim period, both companies will undertake complications with all works counsels as required. We are delighted with this transaction and the substantial value we expect it to create for our shareholders. By retaining a 49% stake, we will continue to benefit from the future growth of the coffee category and sharing the synergies and tremendous upside of this leading to pure-play coffee company. We expect to use the majority of the approximately $5 billion of cash proceeds to extend our share repurchase program subject to Board approval. The balance of the cash proceeds will be used for debt reduction and for general corporate purposes. Let me assure you that while deploying the cash proceeds, we remain committed to maintaining an investment grade credit rating with assets to Tier 2 commercial paper. In terms of our P&L, we expect the transaction to be accretive to adjusted EPS in the first full year after closing. In addition to unlocking and creating significant value for our coffee business, this transaction will also enhance the profile and prospects of our core snacking business. Once completed, approximately 85% of our net revenue will come from snacks, up from about 75% today. Going forward, this sharper focus will help optimize our capital allocation, including investments to drive growth of our global platforms and to expand routes to market. So, that's the first type of the news. Now let's turn to the second type. We're taking actions today to accelerate and enhance margin expansion. Specifically, we are fast tracking our previously announced supply chain reinvention program and significantly reducing overhead costs. As Daniel Myers explained last September, over the next three years, we expect to deliver $3 billion in gross productivity savings, $1.5 billion in net productivity and $1 billion in incremental cash. We\u2019ve already made good progress against those goals. We\u2019re on track to open our state-of-the-art biscuit facility in Mexico in the fourth quarter. We've initiated significant projects in India, China and Russia. We're expanding biscuit manufacturing in the Czech Republic and investing in new biscuit manufacturing technology in the U.S. In addition, we've made some tough decisions to close or sell 9 plants and streamline another 21. As a result, in 2013 alone, we've reduced headcount in our supply chain by 3,000 plus another 1,000 contractors. All of these actions will enable delivery of the benefits we previously outlined. We also laid out additional opportunities through 2020 to manufacture more of our Power Brands on advantage lines of the future and to streamline our production base. Today, we're taking steps to accelerate some of those projects. This will allow us to capture savings even sooner and result in additional margin upside through 2018. With this accelerated program, we now expect our net productivity to increase from the 2.3% we talked about in September to around 3% over the next few years. With respect to overhead, as we discussed the CAGNY in February, we're committed to creating a leaner, simpler and more nimble organization by significantly reducing operating costs. Achieving best in class overhead costs across our business is particularly important, given the near-term slowdown in the growth of our categories especially in emerging markets. In addition, the combination of our coffee business with D.E Master Blenders allows us to create an even simpler more focused global snacking company. To drive overhead savings, we're starting with the clean sheet of paper and employing a zero-base budgeting approach. With the help of Accenture, we used ZBB analytical tools to look objectively at our overhead costs and compare them to best in class external benchmarks. This has enabled us to question how, where and why we spend our money. While this certainly involves addressing headcount, we're also targeting non-headcount costs. The lowest hanging fruit is to look at our policies and practices across a dozen major cost areas to identify changes that will help us to quickly reduce costs in a sustainable way. As an example, our travel costs are significantly higher than peers\u2019, that\u2019s partly because we travel more, reflecting the coordination necessary during the Cadbury and LU integrations as well as the startup of our new company. But it\u2019s also because we weren\u2019t effectively leveraging our scale with suppliers. If you multiply that example to many other cost areas across our company it adds up pretty quickly to some big savings. To enable us to capture these savings in both our supply chain in overheads our board has approved a new $3.5 billion restructuring program through 2018 comprised of approximately $2.5 billion in cash costs and $1 billion in non-cash costs. We expect to incur the majority of the restructuring charges in 2015 and 2016. Capital expenditures in support of these programs are already included in our CapEx target of about 5% of revenues for the next few years. As a result of this program we expect to generate annualized savings of at least $1.5 billion by 2018 with savings about equally split between supply chain and overheads. With $1.5 billion of savings on $2.5 billion of cash costs it\u2019s clear that these project have very strong returns well in excess of our cost of capital. The cost savings from this restructuring program will enable us to accelerate and increase our future margin expansion plans. Specifically we are raising bottom end of our 2016 adjusted OI margin range so that we are now targeting 15% to 16% up from 14% to 16%. This improvement comes largely from greater overhead savings. After 2016, along with continued improvement in overheads we expect the contribution from supply chain to build. This will enable us to drive further margin expansion beyond our revised 2016 target, while continuing to fund growth. Taking together the strategic initiatives we\u2019ve announced today underscore our determination to become a leaner, more focused and more nimble global snacking powerhouse. Let me now turn the call over to Dave, to provide details on our first quarter results. Dave Brearton : Thanks Irene. As you\u2019ll see in the next few slides, we\u2019re off to a solid start this year. We\u2019re making meaningful progress towards our margin goals, while continuing to deliver growth and strong market shares. Specifically, our organic net revenue growth was 2.8% in line with the overall growth of our categories and within our 2% to 3% guidance range for the quarter. On the margin front, we delivered a big increase in adjusted operating income margin up a 140 basis points to 12.2%. And our adjusted EPS was $0.39 that\u2019s up 17% on a constant currency basis and on the higher end the double-digit guidance we gave for the year. Looking more closely at our revenue growth, pricing was the key contributor as we began to implement price increases in all of our regions and across most of our categories to offset higher input costs. Despite, these pricing actions we were able to drive the modest increase into our mix. And while the shift of Easter was a headwind for the quarter the 40 basis points impact was lower than expected. Coffee remained a headwind, but the pass-through of lower green coffee costs tampering our growth by 60 basis points. Emerging markets were up nearly 7% reflecting challenging conditions in a number of key countries. Our developed markets were essentially flat growing 0.2%. Overall our Power Brands continue to drive our growth increasing 4.8% in particular Cadbury, Dairy Milk, Milka, Chips Ahoy, belVita, Tuc (inaudible) and Tang were among our best performers in the quarter. Now let\u2019s take a closer look at our results by cash grades. For the second consecutive quarter category growth was slower than historical averages with growth of only 2.8%. This was due in part to the Easter shift but also reflects continued weak demand in emerging markets and lower coffee prices. With Easter occurring three weeks later than last year some consumer demand was pushed into the second quarter, however revenue was less effective as we started shippings distribute related products in March. This can best you see in chocolate for a 2.3% growth significantly outpaced the category growth rate of 1%. The ongoing global slowdown was the second factor that contributed to sluggish growth across the most of our categories. But good news is that our market share performance was solid with over 60% of our revenues gaining or holding share, despite the price increases mentioned earlier. A closer look at our categories shows that our biscuit performance remained strong. While 4.7% revenue growth in biscuits was below the category rate our overall share performance was strong especially in North America and Europe. The difference was solely due to our China business. Turning to chocolate. Our Cadbury, Dairy Milk and Milka Power Brands each grew high single digits fueling in our growth. In addition over 50% of revenues gained or held share. Our share performance in India in particular was strong, up over 2.5 in a category that continues to grow about 20%. Our results reflect recent capacity investments to support the tremendous from that market. Turning to Gum and Candy, our revenues fell 2.1% as an increase in gum was more than offset by a decline in candy. Our gum share performance continue to improve as we gained a held share in over half of our gum revenues. In beverages, our revenues increased 2.3% despite the headwinds from lower coffee pricing. Although the cost of green coffee has surged over the past two months from about a $1.20 to about $2 per pound, those prices are not yet reflected in the market. Input costs for the first half are still being covered [appraised] by prices. However, we recently announced price increases in Europe that will begin to take effect in late Q2. So, we expect higher pricings to be reflected in the back half of the year. As for powdered beverages, category growth continued to be robust, for Tang up in the low 20s. Let's now take a look at our regional results, where we delivered solid topline performance in 4 of our 5 regions. In Europe, while revenue fell 1%, coffee tampered growth by about 1.5 points. Vol/mix was up nearly a point, despite the impact of the Easter shift and some short term customer dispute as we took (inaudible). Over 70% of our revenues gained or held share. North America had another strong quarter, with revenue up 2.5%, fueled by 5% growth in biscuits. Share performance again was exceptional with over 85% of our revenue gaining or holding share. Gum in the U.S. was up over a point. In emerging markets, as expected we experienced some share dislocations, as consumers adjusting to a higher pricing. As a leader in our categories and many of these markets, we're typically one of the first to price in response the higher input costs. Input costs began to creep up at the end of last year especially in berry and coco and in many emerging markets, we prefer to see further magnified this impact. As a result, we began to price aggressively early this year. In some cases competitors have been slow to follow resulting in sheer dislocation in some key markets. We expect this to be temporary as competitors ultimately price to offset the higher input costs, which are common to the entire industry. Our EMEA region grew nearly 8% with good contributions from both vol mix and pricing. Russia increased high single-digits driven largely by vol mix; coffee, biscuits and gum drove the increase. Also in the region, the Gulf State, Turkey and Egypt all delivered strong growth. Not surprisingly, Ukraine declined double-digits. In Latin America, pricing especially in the high inflation markets of Venezuela and Argentina drove organic growth of 14.7%. But importantly, Brazil was up high single-digits. Powdered beverages and biscuits drove the bulk of the revenue increase, while chocolate growth was modest due to the Easter shift. Asia-Pacific was our long lighting performer, down 2.7% for the quarter. As expected, China was weak with organic revenue down mid-teens primarily due to biscuits. Easter\u2019s were working to in China are not new. We expect that to be China be drag in Q1 and through the first half as we lag last year's inventory build in support from our AMC investment and the launch of Golden Oreo. While we continue to expect the China biscuit category to be soft for the remainder of the year likely growing in the low single-digits, our revenue trends in the second half should improve as we begin to lap last year\u2019s slower growth. In contrast of biscuits, (inaudible) China continues to grow rapidly as expand distribution. Gum share is now over 7% just a year and half after launching in that market. We\u2019re taking a number of steps to improved China\u2019s overall performance. Earlier this week, we hired Steven Mars, our new Head of China. Steven joins us from Carlsberg Group where he was CEO of the company\u2019s China business. In total he has 16 years of on the ground experience in China including principal P&G and Colgate. We are looking forward to Steven\u2019s leadership as he and his team gets China back on the growth trajectory. India continues to deliver strong performance. With our new chocolate capacity in place, we have been able to regain the share we lost in the first half last year. Our beverages business which is now 5th of our sales there was up mid-teens. We continue to successfully expand our Tang business and increase support behind our top selling chocolate beverage Bournvita. Turning to margins; adjusted gross margin was essentially flat with 37.1% as gross profit grew 2.3% on a constant currency basis. Pricing fully offset commodity inflation in dollar terms despite the fact that we\u2019ve not yet fully realized the impact of the pricing actions we implemented earlier this year. On a percentage basis of course, the denominator effect of this pricing pressure of the gross margin percept. Net productivity was strong and in line with our goal to deliver 2.3% of cost of goods sold this year. As a result, our gross margin percentage was essentially flat to prior year. In terms of adjusted OI margin, we jumped 140 basis points to 12.2%. Half of this gain was a direct result from our efforts to significantly reduce overheads. The other half came from AMC, which was about 9% of net revenue. This compared to last year\u2019s quarterly high of 9.6% when we accelerated investment in China. To be clear, we didn\u2019t cut our base brand support. We successfully lowered AMC cost through efficiencies gained by consolidating our media accounts especially in EMEA, reducing non-working media spending and continuing to shift towards more efficient and targeted digital outcomes. Consistent with our margin goals we made great progress this quarter towards achieving our adjusted OI margin targets in developed markets. Europe was up 130 basis points to 13.9% and North America was up 240 basis points to 13.8%. Moving to EPS; adjusted EPS grew 17.1% on a constant currency basis driven by double-digit growth in operating income. The [logo] line, the impact of having a more normal tax rate was a negative $0.06 impact, but that was partially offset from $0.04 of favorability delivered through debt restructuring and share repurchases. Before turning to guidance, I\u2019d like to quickly update you on where we stand on cash flow and capital allocation. Our approach to capital allocation remains the same. We\u2019ll continue to deploy capital to deliver the best expected returns whether it\u2019s reinvested in the business, M&A, reducing debt or returning capital to shareholders. With regard to free cash flow, we remained on track to deliver a two year combined target of $3.7 billion. As you may know, we tend to be free cash flow negative in the first quarter as we rebuild inventories after seasonal lows at the end of the year. At the end of Q1 this year, while our inventories were unusually high due to the Easter shift, we were still able to improve our cash conversion cycle by 17 days versus Q1 last year. In the first quarter we returned more than $700 million to our shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. For the full year, we still expect to return to $2 billion to $3 billion to our shareholders including $1 billion to $2 billion in stock buybacks. With respect to our debt, we were up about $2 billion versus year-end largely reflecting cash returned to shareholders and the working capital increase that I just described. In addition, we paid taxes associated with the $2.8 billion Starbucks award that we received in December. Turning to our outlook for the year, we expect to deliver organic net revenue growth that\u2019s in line with overall category rates. However, as I described earlier, global category growth has slowed to around 3% for the last two quarters due largely to the weakness in emerging markets and lower coffee prices. We expect these trends will continue in Q2 likely resulting in top-line growth similar to what we saw in Q1. In our second half, we expect the pass-through of higher Green coffee cards will benefit revenue, but we may also experience some disruptions to our top-line as we implement our strategic initiatives. As a result, we expect revenue growth to improve modestly in the second half. For the year then, we expect organic revenue growth to be in line with all the category growth of about 3%. Importantly though, we remain confident in our profit outlook. Specifically we are confirming our guidance of double-digit adjusted OI growth on a constant currency basis, adjusted OI margin in the high 12% range and adjusted EPS of $1.73 to $1.78 on a constant currency basis. With that let me turn it back to Irene for some closing thoughts. Irene Rosenfeld : Thanks Dave. So to sum up, the strategic in cost reductions and actions that we announced today, underscore are determination to become a linear, more focused and more nimble global snacking power house. As our first quarter results show, we are making meaningful progress toward our margin goals, while continuing to deliver solid growth and market shares. The actions we have outlined today will sharpen our focus on snacks, simplify our operations, enhanced and accelerate our ability to deliver world class margins, provides a fuel to invest in our core snacking business to drive top tier growth and position us to deliver superior returns to our shareholders.  With that, I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I have got a question about the coffee business, the coffee transaction. I guess the first is just simply Irene, can you talk about the strategic rational and maybe more specifically was it driven more by your view of some changes potentially occurring in the coffee industry or was it more specific to just how coffee sit in your portfolio? Irene Rosenfeld : Actually Bryan coffee continues to be a very attractive category, it's growing -- category today within our portfolio is growing at good margin. In fact the margins are actually above our Mondel\u0113z average and we have seen terrific growth as you know in on demand in particular. But we saw a unique opportunity to combine our business, a very strong business with the DEMB portfolio. And I always think the partnership is a win-win. We received the upfront cash proceeds that we've described of approximately $5 billion after-tax. We intend to use the majority of that and as I said for share buybacks subject to our Board approval. But the balance will be used and the balance will be used for debt reduction and general corporate purposes, while still maintaining our investment grade credit rating. We also thought at the same time received a 49% interest yet a very attractive company, it\u2019s a leading pure-play coffee company, it has a set of iconic brands with as I mentioned leading positions in over a dozen markets, it provides greater global scale and it's highly complementary in terms of the geographic footprint. All businesses come with some very unique technologies in R&D and in on-demand D.E Master Blenders have strong technology with good coffee. We're going to combine the best-of-both from a management team standpoint. We feel very good about our partners as I mentioned, they\u2019re highly respected business executive. And if gives us the ability to focus on snacking portfolio much more directly and ensure that we have the opportunity to optimally allocate our resources. So net-net, this is the opportunity to take what is a strong business and make it even stronger, while creating great value for the both partners I believe, as well as for our shareholders. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. And if I could just follow-up, a question for you Dave, just in terms of just the value of the deal, I think back of the envelope, if you get back a little bit less EBITDA than what you're contributing, but the net $5 billion of proceeds after cash, it's roughly similar in the neighborhood of $3 of incremental value creation that we saw this morning. So I guess my question would be, is that kind of the right way to think about how we should be thinking about valuating the transaction? And then also just connected to that in terms of cash flow with this business going into JV, just what\u2019s the mechanism for the JV to kick the cash flow back to Mondel\u0113z? Thank you. Dave Brearton :  Yes, I think on the valuation, if you look at it in a lot ways, I mean [carefully] we're putting in our business and so it's more about the upside of the two businesses combined that\u2019s going to generate the value for this business. I don't think -- it\u2019s just kind of complicated when you saw joint ventures I don't think we'll get into that. But I think you\u2019ve seen the multiple that D.E Master Blenders was purchase at and I think clearly that was one other consideration as we put our business into that. In terms of cash flow, today the coffee cash flow obviously is part of our ongoing free cash flow and as Irene mentioned OI margin is above the average of our business, so it\u2019s pretty healthy cash flow. That we obviously lose. We\u2019re going to pick up $5 billion upfront and then the ongoing cash flow will come from dividends. And actually we filed an 8-K this morning along with the press release and you can see the dividend specifics in there. But it\u2019s a relatively fixed amount for the first three years and then it\u2019s tied to net operating profit thereafter. So, we\u2019ll get a dividend instead of the ongoing cash flow of our business. Clearly that will be a lower number in aggregate but we get $5 billion upfront in cash. Dexter Congbalay : Operator, get the next question please. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar - Barclays:  Should we expect -- I guess on slide 12 you show the impact form the coffee transaction. First off, I assume that\u2019s the impact of stranded overheads and if so, it looks like you expect these accelerated cost saves ZBB and such will more than cover those overheads by \u201816 but would we expect this to be a linear path or to margin need to take a step back in \u201815 when your stranded costs come out and then get immediately offset by the incremental savings? Dave Brearton :  Yes. I think when you look at that page, the red bar there, it isn\u2019t so much about stranded overheads; it\u2019s just that as Irene mentioned earlier the OI margin on coffee is higher than the Mondel\u0113z average. So it has a small decrement to our average OI margin. I think the stranded overhead piece is actually quite small. Most of the people in the overheads that are associated with our coffee business today will transfer over to the new company. There will be some stranded overheads but it\u2019s relatively small and it would be taken out through the restructuring program that we\u2019ve talked about today as well. As it relates to 2015 margins, we didn\u2019t give you a margin target for 2015 today, mostly because it\u2019s going to be tied largely to the timing of the closing of coffee transaction, the progress we make on the work councils and union discussions. But this year, we\u2019ll be in the high 12s in our OI margin. In 2016, we\u2019ll be between \u201815 and \u201816. And we\u2019d expect to make measurable progress towards that 2016 goal next year. So, it\u2019s hard for me to give you guidance specifically on 2015 given some of the timings things that I can\u2019t predict today but we\u2019ll make measurable progress. Andrew Lazar - Barclays: That\u2019s really helpful. And then the one thing that surprises me I guess about your comment about stranded overhead is, that was always one of the -- I think one of the reasons that was always given as to why it was important that coffee and grocery I guess to the extent be part of Mondel\u0113z for that scale impact and recovering of fixed and such in some of the European region. And so, I guess I would have thought by parting with that there would be a bigger headwind to cover from that. And I think in certain markets like Russia, if I am not mistaking, you can kind of go to market between coffee and chocolate kind of on the similar system. So I guess just a little clarity on that would be helpful. Dave Brearton : Yes, I think it\u2019s really because of the structure of the transaction we\u2019ve talked about today. As we create the new company, the two businesses are highly complementary but aren\u2019t that many countries where we have major overlaps. So in a place like Russia, we\u2019re going to be carving out a coffee sales force for the new company and providing that to the new company. So that\u2019s the biggest difference from what you would have expected from the sale transaction because it\u2019s the new company that we\u2019re partnering with, we can contribute most of the people and the overheads and cash to that new company. And because it\u2019s largely complementary in terms of geography, it\u2019s -- they\u2019re going to need most of those costs. So that\u2019s really what\u2019s different versus the historical factors as we have had. But you\u2019re right, a lot of the countries have combined sales forces today, so that\u2019s an exercise we need to go through over the next years. Andrew Lazar - Barclays: Okay, that\u2019s helpful, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Chris Growe - Stifel: Hi, good morning. Dave Brearton : Good morning, Chris. Chris Growe - Stifel: Hi. I had just a follow up on the interest question. I had a question regarding the -- looking at scale little differently and that is scale at retail and how that taken away the coffee asset speed in Europe or even Eastern Europe we have an effect on your growth profile with European call grocery business, do you see any effect from losing this business in that regard? Irene Rosenfeld : We actually see the opportunity because coffee is much more of a center of store kind of item and our snacking business tends to be more front-end and imports driven, we actually see the opportunity to focus for respective selling organizations on what they do best. It\u2019s not unlike the kind of thinking we had as we put the North American grocery business up. So we actually are looking for these new selling organizations to be a lot more focused on their respective categories and actually we believe that will help to drive growth. Chris Growe - Stifel: Okay. And then just a follow up question on revenue growth, as you look at revenues for the year, the plus 3%, have you considered a higher degree of price realization coming through to support that growth? And are there any pricing [exercise] taken as some, as you said there may be some short term challenges with market share, but anywhere we are seeing these challenges getting to pricing as you expected earlier in the year? Dave Brearton : Yes, the revenue growth we have given was essentially [pricing] category growth rate, I think both are revenue and the category will reflect a lot more pricing this year and probably a lot more -- a lot less volume mix growth. So that\u2019s difficult when you have price taken increases. In terms of the pricing so far, it\u2019s a bit early to tell, we are putting a lot of the pricing in emerging markets early in the first quarter. And as I mentioned a few minutes ago, competitors some have followed, some have not. But I think its common into industry, I would expect it to come through. Europe is a little bit later, because it takes a while to negotiate the price increases with the trade in Europe. So, we're not going to see the full benefit of that come through until Q2. So, it's a bit early to tell, but I think historically when we've had commodity increases that are common to industry, we've been able to price away those costs. And so I would expect that it will come through as we're planning this year. Chris Growe - Stifel: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets : Congratulation. You mentioned revenue growth of 3% for the year, which is close to the growth rate of the first quarter. That first quarter includes a point drag however from Easter and coffee deflation which are factors that when we think will reverse in Q2 or at least Q3 in the case of coffee prices. Are you seeing a slowdown in your base business or actually anticipating disruption from the restructuring as you think about that 3%? Dave Brearton : I think it is -- you are correct, the first quarter had 40 basis points of an Easter impact and about 60 basis points of coffee. I think the coffee we expect to continue in the second quarter. I think the -- we did say, we would expect some positive bounce in as coffee goes from being a headwind to potentially even a tailwind in the back half. But I think the flip side of that is as you mentioned, there could be some disruption from some of the strategic initiatives we put in place. And frankly, we're just being prudent. The category has grown over the last two quarters now around 3%. And so we felt it was prudent to not count on a terrific turnaround and to plan on that for the balance of the quarter. So, it's not just a quarter one comment, it's been six months now of about 3% category growth. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets : And how much of your business will be Europe pre and post the deal? Thank you. Irene Rosenfeld :  It\u2019s down about 1 or 2 percentage point there in that if you look at the configuration post transaction close. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley : Just a follow-up on the questions on revenue growth. I know it's difficult to pull out the crystal ball on this, but how confident are you that you'll see some recovery in category trends in 2015 and beyond? And just as you're thinking about prospects for EPS growth given your new margin targets, are you assuming a gradual recovery back to 4% to 5% or sales growth or thinking about this, the new run rate? Irene Rosenfeld :  That\u2019s one of the reasons we took the actions that we announced today is to ensure that despite what happens on our top-line even if trends continue with the same rate that we have great confidence that we can deliver on the margin target and therefore on our EPS commitments. Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley : Okay, thanks. And Dave, you spoke to the cash costs, the restructuring program being largely front loaded during the first two years. Just as we're thinking about the phasing of cost savings and the potential for margin expansion beyond 2016, can you give us a rough sense of what portion of the $1.5 billion in restructuring savings should be realized by 2016? Dave Brearton :  I think it will flow through pretty steadily. The upfront yeas will be more overhead less supply chain, the later years will be more supply chain, because that takes a little longer to get underway. So, I don't think you'll see a massive skew. I wouldn't expect a huge impact this year though. Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley : Okay. And just as we\u2019re thinking about the margin progression again for those out years, is there any degree of expected base margin expansion that\u2019s now just being pulled forward in a way that would moderate the margin prospects for those latter two years? Dave Brearton :  I think we haven\u2019t given a specific margin target beyond 2016, mostly because it\u2019s quite away from now. But we have said we\u2019ll be 15% to 16% in 2016 as an OI margin and the savings that are going to come beyond that in 2017 and \u201818 should allow us to continue to make margin progress in \u201817 and \u201818. And obviously we\u2019ll continue to invest in our businesses just to drive growth while we are doing all of that through that entire prior period. Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley : Alright, thank you. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank. Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank :  Good morning everybody. Dave Brearton :  Good morning, Eric. Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank :  I guess just first on the coffee if I could ask a question, you noticed, knowing that it\u2019s high teens margins but that\u2019s drawing a very low cyclical point in coffee cost, so kind of what is more of a normalized coffee margin for the business? Dave Brearton :  I think you have to define what normal coffee costs are. I think 1.20 two months ago was actually not far off the 10 year average, 2 bucks is obviously pretty high and you are absolutely correct though the revenue creates a bigger denominator if green coffee goes up and reduce that margin. But I think it has been historically pretty consistently higher OI margin than the rest of our business. Irene Rosenfeld :  That\u2019s also been particularly true Eric as we shifted from roast and ground business, predominantly roast and ground business more into on demand and soluble and that\u2019s been a trend that has been improving over the last couple of years as we have made those investments in (inaudible) for example. Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank :  Okay. And then more about kind of the restructuring, maybe following up a little bit on Matt\u2019s question. I guess Irene, followed you for a long time at Craft and now Mondel\u0113z, I mean there is just you\u2019ve made a lot of well received strategic rules, but I would say that so much restructuring so much cash leaving really historically has it led to great fundamental performance. This was [growthco] 18 months ago and the top-line target has now taken a complete back seat. So if I was working in Mondel\u0113z I would be kind of wondering what are my targets. I used to be let\u2019s say recruited here to be a brand manager with growth and now it\u2019s all about cost savings and ZBB. So I guess as we kind of go through this next iteration of change in restructuring like what how do you keep people like focused or motivated and how disruption are you, do you think is going to occur from so much going on within the company? Irene Rosenfeld : Eric I think you make a fair observation. I would remind you as you know our last restructuring program was in 2004 and 2008. We did deliver the targeted savings under that program but we had a business that was severely in need of reinvestment at that time. And if you recall in 2006 our shares were declining our product quality was not where it needed to be, we didn\u2019t have an innovation pipeline. So we did reinvest most of our savings back into the business and quite frankly I would argue we have created some great value on a number of those businesses which allowed us a lot of this put off to North American grocery business and create great value for shareholders. At this point though we\u2019re in a very different position. Our shares have now been consistently positive for a couple of years. We\u2019ve got our investments up to where we need them to be on our snacking businesses and I have great confidence that the savings that we have laid out, you will see reflected in our P&L and exactly made the commitments today to take up the bottom end of our rates over these next couple of years and as we have said we actually see some additional upside beyond that as a consequence of the investments. With respect to how should employees react, there is a lot to absorb here, there is no question about that but our employees are committed to creating this global snacking power house that we will leave in the market place and it is clear that as the environment has changed in large measure, it was imperative that we take appropriate actions to address some of the inefficiencies in our cost structure while continuing to drive growth, if anything the number of the actions that we are describing today will certainly help our margins but will also give us the fuel to reinvest in growth. So I actually don\u2019t take an inconsistent message, we continue to outperform our peers in most markets around the world, it\u2019s just a more challenging environment so I think we all had imagined as we created this company 18 months ago, but net-net I have great confidence that the actions that we are taking today will make us a stronger company and increase confidence in our ability to deliver top tier financial results. Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank : Thanks. I will pass it on. Good luck. Irene Rosenfeld : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Ken Goldman - JPMorgan: Hey, thanks for the question. Dave I don\u2019t think you addressed this, forgive me if you did. Can you help us to understand how much net debt the new coffee-co had on its balance sheet? I am asking just because if we are trying to model the improvement in your non-controlling interest, I guess we want better understand to how much interest expense that entity will have. So is it fair to assume [BE] will finance the $5 billion with all debt, how much legacy interest expense of debt do they have, just curious for any color you can help with there. Thanks Dave Brearton : Yes. I don't want to get too much into the financing of the new company. But if you look at the 8-K we issued today. I have highlighted that we're taking out 4 billion euros which is the $5 billion we referred to. And the [JAB] folks are talking out \u20ac2.5 billion and I think any all the financing of that would be in the new company, it will be nothing at our level or above that. Ken Goldman - JPMorgan: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi Research Unidentified Analyst : (Inaudible) and with few questions on behalf of David. Hello? Dave Brearton : Go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. Just wanted to know if you could give us what's the combined pro forma EBITDA for the new coffee business will be? And then going forward what type of, what level of cost synergies do you think will be able to be achieved by combining the businesses? Dave Brearton : Yes, I think as we said today, we think the new company will have margins in the high teens on the EBITDA level, we haven't given any cost synergy numbers. I think I would say that some of the excitement of this business is that it\u2019s highly complementary both in technology as well as geographic platforms in brand. So, I would say the revenue synergies frankly are as exciting of any cost synergies that could come out of it. And as I mentioned earlier, on line of the countries that our business is in, they are not and vice-versa So, I think this is as much about being a global pure play coffee company as it is about traditional synergies. Unidentified Analyst : And so on your kind of accretion analysis and innings of that accretion in the first full year, you are saying there is not much in a way of cost synergies kind of baked into that projection? Dave Brearton : I would say that I'm not going to get into specifics of the new company's business plan, but I would say that as we talk about accretion of the first full year that reflects the cash we received and assuming the majority of that cash goes to buy back shares with a substantial portion potentially for debt pay down as well. So, I think that's more driver and the fact that we will be consolidating 49% of the net income of the company as minority interest position within our earnings per share number. So that's way that really comes from. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And one last thing on chocolate, can you just talk a little bit about the range of price increases that you\u2019ve taken and just kind of generally how well have they have been excepted thus far? Dave Brearton : It varies a lot. I mean in Europe obviously the pricing to recover the cocoa and dairy cost and most recently not costs. And those costs, those price increases were negotiated in the first quarter and we've got those lined up, but they really didn't impact our revenue until late in March. So you'll see those kind of flow through in the second quarter. I really don't want to get into net price increases, because frankly that gets into trade deals and other things. In the emerging market is much higher, because not only a recovery in cocoa and dairy, we\u2019re also cutting the currency impact in most of those countries. So you're looking at price increases in emerging markets anywhere from high single-digits to mid-teens it depends on the country. So it's fairly significant in emerging market. Those mostly were put in place in the first quarter and they're playing through and I would expect that those are on the shelf in most of those countries obviously that are there today. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs : A couple of quick housekeeping questions on the coffee transaction. The dividend income stream that you disclosed in the 8-K, the split between Acorn and you, should we use the same ratio as the cash distribution? Dave Brearton : I would use the same ratio of the ownership of the future company. Jason English - Goldman Sachs : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Timing wise some time in 2015 it sounds like you are pretty confident in terms of regulatory approval, why such a protracted timeline? Dave Brearton :  It\u2019s not just regulatory approval, it\u2019s also the works council consultations that we need to go through in Europe. So as with any transaction like this, you need to consult with the works councils and you need to complete those consultations before you can close the transaction on the case of absence where you can actually accept the offer. So there is a process we need to follow. We went through the same process when we bought the biscuit business from the Danone. So we understand that process pretty well. And it\u2019s just a question of timing. So it will be sometime in the course of 2015 and that\u2019s why we have been a bit reluctant to give a specific guidance for next year and we have really focused on this year in 2016. Jason English - Goldman Sachs : Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And one last question, back to fundamentals. Looking at slide 16 where you showed geographic your share performance, great share performance in the developed markets, a relatively soft performance across each region of emerging markets. Can you give us some more color on what\u2019s driving that share weakness and on a forward what you expect and why? Dave Brearton :  Yes, I think if you go back over the last two years we have been pretty consistently strong and shares across all other region. So this is an aberration, but as I mentioned a few minutes ago, we took pricing in the first quarter and in most of those markets we are the price leader. And so we have priced to recover commodity and ForEx impacts within our cost. And we\u2019ve successfully done that through. Some of our competitors are lagging those price increases. But in the end these are all common to industry cost increases. So I would be surprised if they don\u2019t eventually come up. So I would expect that to normalize. It\u2019s fairly typical when we are in the price increase environment; price leader takes a bit of it after the first few months. Jason English - Goldman Sachs : Got it, makes sense. Thanks a lot guys, I will pass it on. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with BMO Capital Markets. Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets : Hi everyone. Irene Rosenfeld : Hi Ken. Dave Brearton : Good morning. Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets : I have just a big picture, what was the catalyst to push you to reevaluate the extent of your margin structure. I mean you guys have been looking at the portfolio for some time, what pushed you to do this mix restructuring effort? Irene Rosenfeld : Well, as our global categories have slowed down particularly in the emerging markets, the need to drive best-in-class cost becomes that much more important for us to deliver on our bottom-line commitments. And so we\u2019ve been talking about that for quite some time now. Obviously there was a big subject of discussion with our Board at our strategic plan last summer. And we\u2019ve been working on a number of these initiatives. We shared with you the early thinking on supply chain, at back-to-school we talked to you about some of the work that we were just beginning on zero-based budgeting with respect to overhead at -- and what we\u2019ve announced today essentially reflects the combination of those activities. Obviously the coffee transaction is something that was happening concurrent with the number of these other thoughts, but they\u2019re highly interrelated and that\u2019s why we have great confidence that as we take these actions together that we will be able to drive additional margin expansion sooner, while still continuing to support our franchises. Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets : Would you expect to have anymore additional actions to be taken in terms of it is a portfolio refinement or even another level deeper into cost not at this coffee structuring is not excellent I don\u2019t want to minimize that and the effort there. But is there I mean as you get deeper and deeper in this, do you think this ball is going to keep on rolling in terms of portfolio refinement and cost restructuring? Irene Rosenfeld : I think the cost piece of it we\u2019re committing to approximately 300 to 400 basis points improvement over these next three years, that\u2019s a fairly substantial commitment that we\u2019re making on the margin front and we\u2019ve got some very strong programs behind that. We\u2019ll continue to push as aggressively as we can, but I think the target that we\u2019ve laid out are quite aggressive. And as we suggested, we see the opportunities as we make some of our supply chain investments to help accelerate our delivery there. That will have some benefits beyond 2016. So I think the commitments we have made today are quite aggressive. At the same time from a portfolio standpoint, this coffee transaction was a unique opportunity to create the world\u2019s largest pure play coffee company, and we believe we have accomplished that by creating great value for both partners and creating good value for our shareholders, both today and then looking into the future. So we feel quite pleased with the overall implications of the transactions and as well as the actions that we\u2019ve announced today. Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets : Great, I appreciate it. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard from Sanford Bernstein. Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein : Can I ask about -- two quick questions. Does your emerging market exposure that I think is 40% today change out after this coffee deal. The second one is does the 15% to 16% margin goal by 2016 still stands even after the coffee is excluded from consolidated earnings? And then finally, just following up on Ken\u2019s question. Could you imagine structuring a similar deal for the cheese and grocery to business which seems even less strategic than the coffee business? Thank you very much? Irene Rosenfeld : So Alexia, our emerging market business will still be about 40% of the portfolio after the transaction. The second question was\u2026 Dave Brearton : The margin, the 15% to 16% margin already takes out coffee, so there is a small coffee decrement that goes in there because coffee has higher margins the rest of portfolio but that\u2019s more than aid up by the savings on the restructuring program. Irene Rosenfeld : And then the last question on the portfolio, as I said coffee is a very unique opportunity for us to create value and we are not going to get into any other hypothetical at this point in time. Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein : Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Bumgarner with Wells Fargo. John Bumgarner - Wells Fargo : Irene, in the absence of seeing some reinvestment in this coffee proceeds, it\u2019s to route to market and wide space growth, how do you see the return on investment as global category growth is slowed; have returns deteriorated at all or how are you thinking about developing markets reinvestment going forward? Thanks. Irene Rosenfeld : Well, I think we've seen some -- a number of good returns on the investments that we made particularly in a number of our markets last year as we thought at that time, we make some investments in route to market in Brazil, in Russia and in India and we've seen great paybacks there. But one place we saw less of a return, has been in China and as we talked, we have pulled back quite a bit from some of those investments. So, we continue to look at these markets on a pay as you go basis. We're monitoring whether or not, we're getting the return as we make investments in areas like route to market. But we have a strong desire to make sure that we are creating the necessary investments in our infrastructure to enable us to benefit as the markets recover. So, I think we've got the right balance here between continuing to make investments that deliver attractive returns while ensuring showing that we're not overinvesting if the markets are not responding as well. So, we keep a very close eye on that. John Bumgarner - Wells Fargo : Okay. Thanks Irene. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Consumer Edge Research. Rob Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research : First question is just I'm curious, I know JV I believe also and to keep comparable in the U.S. And I just can't remember, when you spun -- when you split Mondel\u0113z in Kraft Foods, is there any agreement in place such that you can or can\u2019t operate in Kraft market? I'm just asking just of chance three years, four years kind of wherever you could find that the U.S. is actually very attractive coffee market, are you allowed to sell coffee in U.S.? Irene Rosenfeld : We are not precluding for selling coffee in the U.S. Rob Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research : Okay, perfect. Thanks. And then second, when JV purchased D.E Master Blenders, D.E Master Blenders was obviously spun from Sara Lee. There was a great story behind it. As they sort of kind of work through their strategy upfront before JV bought them, they found themselves actually kind of facing a bit of pressure, mostly on the top-line but then some of the margin estimates came under question et cetera. JV decided this job of being able to purchase the asset but considered potentially trough margins and earnings. Now that you're working with JV kind of post purchasing D.E Master Blenders have like what have you -- I'm not sure if you can provide any color on this. But have you seen that their strategy with the business before the JV with you and then accurate is really more cost focus -- cost saving focused or is this something that we should be thinking as sort of another phase of growth co or and cost co or is it more of a cost savings opportunity? Thanks. Irene Rosenfeld : As you can imagine, we are in a position to be able to make a lot of statements about the combined company going forward. But I will tell you, as I think our approaches to the business are quite well aligned and that's why we see great opportunity and we're pleased to have a 49% of the combined company going forward. Rob Dickerson - Consumer Edge Research : Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management. Dexter Congbalay :  Hi, this is Dexter. Nick and I will be around for the rest of the day to answer any questions you might have. Other than that, thank you all for joining the call and we will talk to you later. Operator :  Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Irene. Irene Rosenfeld :  Thanks Dexter. Good morning. Our second quarter reflected the continued challenges of a difficult macro environment that again tempered category and revenue growth. In fact the operating environment worsened in the quarter in a number of markets especially in Europe. But we continue to expand operating income margins and again delivered strong, high quality EPS growth in the face of these challenges. Adjusted OI margin was 12.6% that\u2019s an increase of a 120 basis points driven by gains in North America and Europe. These operating gains drove a 19% increase in adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis. On the top line however we delivered modest organic revenue growth of 1.2%. While that\u2019s below our expectations and below the overall growth of our categories, it reflects our decision to lead pricing to recover cost increases. Our pricing actions were the most significant influence on our revenue growth rate this quarter. As we said in the past our strategy is to increase prices to fully recover the impacts of input costs and currency overtime. Of course that\u2019s the right thing to do for the long term health of the business and it's critical to driving sustainable profitable growth. Specifically it enables productivity savings to drive gross and operating margins as well as investments in innovation and brand equity. This year we\u2019re experiencing significant inflation in many of our inputs, notably coco and dairy. This has been magnified by weakening currencies in many emerging markets. In fact nearly half of our input cost increase has been due to currency. This required us to take significant price increases especially in chocolate. Give our share positions in most markets we choose to leave those pricing action and what we anticipated that this would be disruptive in the short term it's been even more challenging than we expected. In a number of key countries and categories our competitors have been slow to implement price increases. As a result we\u2019re seeing some negative effects on consumer takeaway as well as on our share performance. Of course our competitors faced the same currency related input cost pressures as we do. So while this dynamic has tempered our revenue growth in the short term especially in emerging markets we believe this impact will be temporary. With that as a backdrop growth in our emerging markets although below our expectations was up a relatively solid 4.7%. In developed markets it's a more complex story, some customers especially in Europe most notably in France have reacted quite severely to our price increases. In fact a member [ph] have refused to accept our pricing which has led to extended disputes and near term distribution losses. Given our leadership on pricing we\u2019re taking the brunt of these punitive actions. But to be clear this is affecting the broader industry not just us. This issue together with slower category growth in Europe drove a 1.2% organic revenue decline in our developed markets. Let\u2019s look more closely at our Q2 revenue by region. As expected pricing had a positive contribution in four of our five regions, in Europe revenue was down 1.9%, vol mix declined primarily due to the pricing related disruptions and slower category growth that I just talked about. The regions overall pricing was down modestly as lower coffee prices offset higher pricing in chocolate and cheese. While lower coffee revenues tempered the region\u2019s growth by 0.4 percentage points we expect coffee will become a tailwind in the second half reflecting the price increases that we began implementing early in Q3. North America increased 2.7% with balance contributions from vol mix and pricing. Biscuits had another strong quarter in part driven by innovations like Oreo Reese's Peanut Butter cups and belVita Soft Baked. Candy also posted solid growth. EMEA grew more than 6% also with balanced contributions from vol mix and pricing. Russia grew mid-single digits including solid gains in biscuits, candy, and coffee as we continue to invest in our hot zone support. Ukraine revenue was up slightly in the quarter which was a tremendous accomplishment given the current political and economic situation. In Latin America revenue grew nearly 12%, pricing in the inflationary economies of Venezuela and Argentina drove much of the increase although it also pressured vol mix. At the same time Brazil delivered high single digit growth including positive vol mix despite aggressive pricing and increased competitive pressures. Growth was solid across all categories, and finally in Asia-Pacific revenue was down about 8% due to continued weakness in China biscuits and a more intense pricing related retail and competitive environment in Australia and New Zealand. India however delivered another quarter of double digit growth. As we look at our results by category the same themes are evident, global category growth for the first half was 3.8% above our organic growth of 2%. In biscuits the entire 200 basis point GAAP between category growth and our revenue growth was attributable to China. We expected a double decline in China biscuits as we cycled last year\u2019s stepped up investments to reinvigorate category growth including the launching of Golden Oreo. In Chocolate, our decision to lead pricing has resulted in a temporary disruptions and customer disputes in Europe that I described earlier. Additionally in some key markets like Brazil and South Africa our competitors have been slow to increase prices. We believe they will eventually price given the sharp rise in coco including a nearly 20% increase year-to-date and the weakening of emerging market currencies but there is also some positive news in our category results. In gum we continue to see steady improvement both in the overall category which was up about 1% and in our revenue which declined only low single digits after several quarters of steeper declines. I\u2019m especially encouraged by our performance in the U.S. where our focus on product assortment and shelf resets, our messaging Oral Care and advantaged innovations like Sour Patch Kids Gum have led to three consecutive quarters of shared growth. We have also continued to deliver strong gum performance in China. In just two years we have captured a 9% share against a strong competitor and we\u2019re on track to deliver a $150 million in revenue this year. Let\u2019s now take a look at market share, overall year-to-date share performance remained solid with 57% of our revenues gaining or holding share. However as it's expected share softened a bit during the quarter as we priced ahead of competitors. This dislocation was most apparent in our emerging market shares as consumers adjust to the inflation driven price increases. EMEA, Latin America and Asia-Pacific all saw market share performance below 40% on a year-to-date basis. Looking forward we expect the shares will continue to soften in the near term especially in Q3. Until competitors implement pricing and we resolve the outstanding customer disputes. So as you can see our revenue growth and share performance was softer than we expected but we believe much of the pricing disruption on revenue and share is temporary and we will revert in the coming months. That said we knew the environment would be challenging and so over the past year we have been rigorously driving productivity, reducing overheads and executing our supply chain reinvention initiatives. All of these actions have helped to protect our bottom line in 2014 and set the stage for profitable growth in 2015 and beyond. With that let me turn it over to Dave. Dave Brearton :  Thanks Irene, and good morning. Over the next few slides I will walk you through our bottom line results and our updated outlook before turning it back to Irene for quick update on some of our strategic and operating initiatives. Adjusted gross profit dollars were down 1.6% for the quarter entirely due to mark to market adjustments but up 0.4% from the first half on a constant currency basis. Adjusted gross profit margin was down 90 basis points this quarter, again entirely due to mark to market adjustments on hedging contracts. In aggregate we fully price to recover commodity and Forex impacts this quarter in line with our strategy. Although the impact differs by region. Gross margins in North America and Europe were up sharply with aggressively productivity savings driving significant step ups versus prior year. However in AP and EMEA we weren\u2019t able to fully offset higher input cost due to the impact of currency. The full benefit of our pricing actions will be realized over the course of Q3 and Q4 and will set us up well for 2015. Productivity was again strong in the first half with gross productivity over 4% of cost of goods sold. Net productivity which is our primary measure was about 2.5% of COGS exceeding our expectations. Adjusted operating income dollars grew nearly 12% for the quarter and nearly 14% in the first half on a constant currency basis. Adjusted OI margin expanded a 120 basis points in the quarter despite the 90 basis point impact from mark to market charges that I previously mentioned. Margin expansion was high quality, we significantly reduced overheads as a result of our ongoing cost management efforts. In addition we continue to drive efficiencies in advertising and consumer support by consolidating media providers, reducing non-working media cost and shifting spending to lower cost digital media outlets. For the first half, AMC represented about 9% of net revenues in-line with our full year expectations. So to be clear, we\u2019re not reducing support of our brands or innovation platforms. We\u2019re maintaining our share of voice at least at historical levels especially in the face of our significant pricing. Taking a closer look at margins, we see that every region posted margin improvement for the first half. The biggest margin and expansion was in our developed markets which as you know is our near term focus. In North America, OI margin was up 310 basis points and Europe increased 200 points. Supply chain and SG&A cost reductions implemented earlier this year drove the improvements. Turning to EPS, adjusted EPS was $0.40 up 19% on a constant currency basis for the second quarter and was $0.79 up 15% on a constant currency basis for the half. Our first half growth was driven entirely by operating gains despite observing a negative $0.04 impact from mark to market charges. Below the line on favorability and taxes was offset by lower interest expense and share repurchases. Let me now quickly update you on where we stand on capital allocation and cash flow. We continued to deploy capital to where we expect to deliver the best returns whether it's reinvestment in the business, M&A, reducing debt or returning capital to shareholders. With regard to free cash flow we remain on track to deliver our two year target of $3.7 billion. In fact at the end of Q2 we improved our cash conversion cycle by 2 days driven by DSO and DPO continuing the progress over the last two years. In the first half we returned $1.4 billion to our shareholders, 900 million of which was through share repurchases. For the full year we still expect to return $2 billion to $3 billion to our shareholders including $1 billion to $2 billion in share buybacks. Finally we have paid almost $500 million in dividends year-to-date and today announced a 7% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.15 per common share. Turning to our outlook, we expect our revenue growth rate in the back half to improve modestly as we pass through higher coffee prices and cycle favorable prior year comparisons especially in China. However we now anticipate revenue growth of 2% to 2.5% for the full year. That\u2019s down from our previous outlook of approximately 3% reflecting continued slower category growth and near term dislocations as customers, competitors and consumers adopt and adjust the higher prices. As we said earlier, we believe the factors pressuring our revenue growth are temporary, category growth rate should improve overtime along with macroeconomic conditions and demographic of snacking trends remain in our favor. Pricing related disputes with our customers are cost of doing business, and all of our competitors face the same challenges from currency related input cost increases. As Irene mentioned we will continue pricing to recover cost impacts allowing our productivity efforts to fuel the investments and innovation and brand equity that drives sustainable profitable growth. Turning to 2014 margin and EPS, we continue to expect adjusted OI margin for 2014 in the high 12% range and EPS guidance of a $1.73 to a $1.78 at constant currency. The pricing actions we\u2019re taking along with the supply chain and overhead reduction initiatives we\u2019re driving enable us to maintain our 2014 earnings targets despite a softer top line. With that let me turn it back to Irene to discuss the strategic and cost reduction initiatives we announced in May. Irene Rosenfeld : Thanks Dave. The headline is we\u2019re on track. First we continue to make good progress on taking the steps necessary to successfully close our coffee transaction in 2015. As you know we intend to combine our coffee business with D.E Master Blenders to create the world\u2019s leading Pure-Play Coffee Company. Both companies have been working closely to prepare for the combination including identifying the key leaders, and having discussions with works councils. Second, we remain firmly committed to delivery best in class costs in both our supply chain and in overheads. Our supply chain reinvention is on track to deliver $3 billion of gross productivity savings and 1.5 billion of net savings by 2016. We have already begun to see the impact of these efforts in the margin improvement in both Europe and North America. Our new biscuits facility in Salinas, Mexico is scheduled to open as planned in the fourth quarter and we\u2019re on track to open new facilities next year in the Czech Republic and in India. As Dave mentioned we\u2019re exceeding our productivity objectives with gross productivity over 4% of cost of goods sold and net productivity at about 2.5% in the first half. With respect to overheads, we\u2019re also advancing our zero base budgeting initiatives. We have identified key areas of improvement in overhead cost assigned accountability for achieving those cost reductions and have already announced several policy changes to begin capturing some non-headcount related savings. We will announce additional changes in the coming month to further drive savings. Finally we are simplifying and standardizing our ways of working across the company. Last week we named Mark Clouse to a newly created position of Chief Growth Officer to ensure that growth remains at the forefront of our strategy and that we bring the same focus and discipline to driving sustainable profitable growth as we\u2019re doing to improving our cost structure. In this role Mark will be accountable for all of the key drivers of growth by overseeing the team\u2019s responsible for corporate strategy, global categories, marketing, sales and R&D. This integrated approach will enable us to more efficiently allocate resources to accelerate expansion of global innovation platforms, power brands, and breakthrough technologies. Also last week we announced that we\u2019re adopting a category led model in all of our regions beginning January 1st, 2015. This region based category led approach is not new to us. Europe has been operating under this model for years, and North America adopted it at the beginning of 2014. So we will leverage the learning from these two regions as we implement this model in our other three. The new operating model will accelerate growth of our power brands and innovation platforms. Provide greater clarity of roles to drive growth, cost and operating excellence. Deliver standardized processes to reduce costs and improve capabilities and finally ensure that we\u2019re making the right investments in long term technologies. All of these actions underscore our determination to become a leaner, more focused and more nimble global snacking power house that delivers top tier performance over the long term. With that let us open for your questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel. Chris Growe \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus : I had just two questions, if I could, for you, Irene. The first, just in relation to the softer category growth rates, I just want to get a better sense of how much you credit that to the pricing that's going through in this category. Are consumers shifting to other categories, as best you can tell? And I guess related to that, have you seen any stabilization of that market share performance through the quarter? It sounded like it remained pretty soft through the quarter. Irene Rosenfeld : I would say, actually I think our categories are holding up better than many. So in the world of food one of the reasons we continue to like participating in snacks is that it tends to have a better trajectory in those markets around the world. So yes our categories have softened but I think they are still outperforming many other food categories. With respect to our shares, it's a little bit of mix bag as you look at different countries around the world. Again the biggest issue is whether in fact our price gaps have widened more than we would like them to be and as we start to see those gaps close in various markets around the world we see our share recovering. So I think that\u2019s what gives us great confidence that what we\u2019re seeing right now is a temporary dislocation. We do think as the pricing gets out there and depending upon reactions out in the marketplace it will take us about another quarter or so to play that through but we would expect that our shares will revert. Chris Growe \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus : Okay. And just one quick follow-up-on to that, then would you expect to see any increase in, say, advertising spending or promotional spending to try and ease the progression to higher prices? Is that one of the solutions to the issues you are having some of these markets? Irene Rosenfeld : Well as Dave said we have been very careful to protect our AMC spending particularly in the challenging pricing environment and we will continue to do so. Any of the changes we have made in AMC have all been in non-working and in consumer oriented activities but our fundamental media spending is exactly where we need it to be to protect our market positions. Operator : Your next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Bryan Spillane \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I've got two questions. The first, just to follow up on Chris's question about organic sales growth -- is there anything different with the consumer in emerging markets today that's making it more difficult to raise prices and I guess above and beyond just the price gaps? And I guess my thinking was just, in the past, for Mondelez and really for most companies, a little bit of inflation at a local level is actually pretty good because it allows you to take maybe cost-plus type pricing. So is there just something different this time around that's making it more different in emerging markets to raise prices? And then I have a follow-up. Irene Rosenfeld : Bryan, I think a little of it just the magnitude. I mean again I talked about the coco being up about 20% and that together with the significant weakening of some of the local currencies has really put a lot of pressure on pricing. And so I think the magnitude is a big part of it but again we\u2019re taking a number of steps aside from making sure that we\u2019re continuing to support our franchise. We\u2019re working very carefully with respect to pricing and sizing to make sure that we\u2019re offering consumers a variety of options at different price points all of which we hope will make this dislocation temporary and allow us to mitigate some of the impacts. Bryan Spillane \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then just to follow up on the change into the category-led model, could you just clarify two things? One, does P&L responsibility at the division level change -- so is it still a regional P&L or is it a category P&L? And I guess similar, with Mark Clouse's new position and where he fits in the organization, does he have P&L responsibility? Irene Rosenfeld : So the P&L will continue to reside at our regional level and within that at the region category level. We really believe for us that is the best balance between capitalizing on local market knowledge and local market execution while at the same time leveraging our scale on a global basis so that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to play this out. Bryan Spillane \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. So how does Mark -- does he have P&L responsibility himself? Irene Rosenfeld : Mark does not have direct P&L responsibility. Our global category teams will continue to steer the overall strategies of our categories out into the marketplace but the P&L will reside closer to the market with our region category leaders and our region presidents. Operator : Your next question comes from David Driscoll of Citi. David Driscoll \u2013 Citi: Wanted just to ask a little bit more about pricing volume elasticity and compared to historical price increases. Can you comment on how the current chocolate price in Europe is going versus those historical periods where you've had to do it? And separately, can you comment on maybe the early read on coffee pricing? And if you can tease out the difference between the two -- I have always felt like coffee was a much safer place to take pricing. But I'd like to hear you comment on those two pieces in Europe specifically. Dave Brearton : In Europe we have obviously faced chocolate pricing in the past. This would be of a magnitude this bigger than what we have done in the past because of the impact of coco going up, actually even the coco butter ratio within that went up, dairy cost went up. So essentially most of the raw materials that go into chocolate went up. And so chocolate has been particularly a hard hit and there has been fairly significant price increases. I would not say the difference this time though is consumer price elasticity. I think difference really is the trade, the trade has pushed back very hard and it reflects the tough environment in Europe and many of the retailers margins themselves are under pressure. So I think the bigger difference this time has been the trade push back and you see that in our shares. Our shares remain quite strong in Europe actually, the shipment is not so strong and that\u2019s really the difference between consumers, so I think are more and less in line with what we expected versus retailers are pushing back much harder. And as you say it's much more, it goes up and down with markets. I think it will be also a little tougher in the past because of the retail environment but it is an easier thing to get a coffee price increased through than a chocolate one, for sure David Driscoll \u2013 Citi: One follow-up, on the revenue outlook I think you made the comment that Europe was the single biggest driver of your reduced overall revenue outlook. But it also seems fair to say that emerging markets are also a bit weaker than expected. Do I have the sequence and magnitude correct between the two pieces of why the revenue guidance is a little bit lower? Dave Brearton : Yes, I mean the emerging markets for the quarter were up 4.7% so less than we would have liked but it's still fairly respectable and as we get into the back half we will continue to have a little bit of a pricing challenges but we\u2019re going to get past that China headwind. So I think emerging markets will still have the pricing challenges but I think you know with the China headwind offsetting that that will be okay. It really is Europe, where we expect to continue to have some retailer pressure and where the pricing really has to flow through completely in the third quarter. So that\u2019s the primary driver. Operator : Your next question comes from David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets. David Palmer \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Two questions from me as well, in the past, have you typically led pricing in all the categories you are implementing pricing today? Or is Mondelez taking a relatively more of a leadership position during this inflation cycle? And, relatedly, are the lags in pricing by competitors atypical this time around? Dave Brearton : I think we have traditionally led pricing where we have market leadership position and that is the case in most of our category country combination. So we have normally led pricing and we did that this time as well. I can\u2019t speak for the competition, they all have their own unique situations but they are facing the same cost increases. It is typical, that you would have some legs in some countries because they all are looking at through their own lens based on whatever their specific facts and circumstances are. I think this time the impact is a little bit bigger than normal just because of the size of the pricing. So if we price and create a bigger price GAAP that GAAP difference is bigger than it has been in the past because of just of the sheer magnitude of the pricing that\u2019s happening and again it's particularly on chocolate. David Palmer \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : And second, you mentioned in your remarks the creation of the Growth Officer position, the need to be nimble and focused and the need for innovation. And all that makes sense. Is there something in terms of your own execution, a particular area that you would want to improve more than others? Perhaps it's the innovation side that you would like to spark. Perhaps it's other marketing. Could you just speak to that? Thanks. Irene Rosenfeld : You know David I think the single biggest opportunity -- I think there is a number of benefits of the new model I think the single biggest opportunities though will lie in growth and speed and very simply taking good ideas from one part of the world more rapidly to another will be a key enabler I think of accelerating growth. So I am quite optimistic about the ability of this new structure and this new position to be able to allow us to move ideas from one part of the world more rapidly to others. Operator : Your next question comes from Eric Katzman at Deutsche Bank. Eric Katzman \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Dave, I was wondering last quarter you mentioned how many basis points lower A&P spending helped in terms of margin expansion. Can you give a little more detail about that this quarter year-over-year? Dave Brearton : Yes I think through the first half as we said we are around 9% of revenue, that\u2019s actually right in-line with what we said we will do on the full year, at the start of the year. The comparison year-over-year is actually impacted by timing last year. The last year we spent about half a point higher than that in the first half and then we spent less than that in the back half. So year-over-year I don\u2019t think there will be a material change but this year it's very smooth, first half, second half. Last year it was much more front weighted and really that comes down to some of the programs we talked about last year led by China. So we\u2019re pretty comfortable that we\u2019re sustaining the AMC at the right level throughout the year this year and that we\u2019re supporting our brands. I think the key is the share voice hasn\u2019t moved and I think that\u2019s the important metrics that we look at. Eric Katzman \u2013 Deutsche Bank : And then how long do you expect these EU disputes to go on? Dave Brearton : I don\u2019t want to get into predicting negotiations but I think -- the guidance we have given you gives us the flexibility to manage through that and I think it's important that we stick to our principles and we have always priced to recover input cost increases, it's important we stick to that because that\u2019s -- if we don\u2019t do that we don\u2019t have the funding to drive growth for ourselves and our customers. So we will continue to push that through but the guidance we have given you today gives us the flexibility to manage through that. Eric Katzman \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Okay. Last question and I will pass it on. You\u2019ve put in the 10Q about possibly having to change, I guess, how you account for the 49% interest you will have in the coffee JV. Is it possible at this point to run through what the implications of that are to the P&L, maybe not specifically but -- if you don't have that. Dave Brearton : I can give you in principal what will happen. So when we get to a point where the deal is certain or it closes we will treat it as a discontinued business or a business held for sale depending on the situation next year probably mid-year. At that point we will strip it out as a discontinued operation, the same as we did when we have done other divestures and so all of our history will be restated to take it out. In terms of the go forward it would be handled in an equity method. So we own 49%, we will take 49% to the net income and that would be part of our EPS but it would be recorded below OI. So it would not be within our OI, it would not be within our OI margins. It would be between OI and EPS but it would be part of the EPS. So that\u2019s how it will work starting and closing -- but we think by the first full year of operation which should be 2016 that it should be EPS accretive. Eric Katzman \u2013 Deutsche Bank : So it's still accretive even if it's now kind of a discontinued op? Do you have to lower the earnings base because it's a discontinued op going backward? Dave Brearton : Yes when I say accretive I mean to where we would have been if we hadn\u2019t done the deal, there is a lots of factors obviously. We lose the OI on coffee when we take it out of the base. We pick up the 49% minority interest and we have got $5 billion of cash coming back which has helped us obviously on the share and the interest side. So that combination of things should be accretive in 2016. Operator : Your next question comes from John Baumgartner of Wells Fargo. John Baumgartner \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities : Irene, just in China, wondering if you can speak to maybe to your execution there. It seems a few quarters ago you were optimistic that maybe shipping some of the brand spend it back to the secondary biscuit brands could stabilize the market share losses. But it sounds as though maybe it hasn't happened quite yet. So just how would you characterize the fundamentals there, maybe your strategy going forward? Irene Rosenfeld : Look we\u2019re not pleased with China\u2019s performance I need to be clear but there is actually no new news there. As we told you last year we saw a quite dramatic slowdown in our biscuits category, we lost some share. We have taken a number of actions to try to address both of those issues but the facts are the biscuit category has not yet recovered in fact it's growing only about 1% to 2%. So the reality is that it's still a challenging situation, the good news is as we have said the toughest comps as we enter the second half of the year, the toughest comps will now be behind us so we\u2019re not going to have the same kind of year-over-year headwind that we have had in the first half. And again we\u2019re quite pleased with the performance of gum in China and that continues to be a really strong story for us. But net-net the China situation is essentially as we had shared it with you and we should start to lap those challenges, we starting to lap those challenging comps as we enter the back half of the year. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Ken Goldman \u2013 JPMorgan: Irene, you talked about the grocers rejecting pricing and maybe taking some products off shelf as a cost of doing business. And that's fair, but I guess it doesn't happen that often. So I'm just curious to understand a bit how it took place. Did your marketing team maybe underappreciate some of the customers' will in this case? And I guess more importantly, where does your confidence come from that this will get resolved? You said you expect your competitors to take pricing eventually. But why would they if they just saw what happened to the industry leader? Irene Rosenfeld : Pricing is always a difficult proposition and we don\u2019t take it lightly particularly in a tough macro environment. What gives us the confidence is that our brands are stronger, traffic drivers for our customers and after a certain point in time it's going to be important to our customers overall growth to have these brands back on the shelf. So we didn\u2019t take those decisions lightly, we made them because it's critical as Dave has said for the long term success and health of our franchise and our ability to continue to invest in them. It was critical to make sure that we\u2019re recovering the cost increases that we\u2019re experiencing. But we are optimistic given the strength of our brands and the role that they play in driving traffic for our customers that we will be able to successfully resolve this dispute but we\u2019re also allowing in our guidance as Dave said for the fact that it's not necessarily happening tomorrow and we want to acknowledge that. Dave Brearton : It has historically happened and we did identify at the quarter one call that we expected some disruption. I think so the tactics are actually the same that we have seen in prior times. The difference this time is it's quite brand across many more retailers and it's quite deep. So it is a typical reaction to dealers, SKUs in France or stop shipments or stop buying for a period of time in France. I think it is more dramatic than we anticipated but it's not a completely new tactic. Ken Goldman \u2013 JPMorgan: One quick one on the U.S. -- at least according to Nielsen data, some traditional snacking categories, all of them, right, cookies, crackers, chocolates, salty snacks, they have all really decelerated. I\u2019m curious if you can talk about what his have been in your view there. We\u2019re seeing some strength in nuts, dried fruit, healthier snack things like that. So just any thoughts you would have on whether there's a share shift within snacking would be helpful. Thank you. Irene Rosenfeld : Actually our snacking business has performed quite well within as you rightly point out a challenging environment, so there is no question, the categories are slowing. We have been outperforming the categories for quite some time and I think it's for couple of reasons. I think we have had a very strong marketing and innovation pipeline in North America. I think or DSD network is operating extremely effectively. And so we believe that we can continue to drive our growth at or above category rates. Our year-to-date biscuit share is up almost a point and our biscuits organic revenue was up about 4% in the first half and it's because of the factors that I mentioned. So I think there is some slowdown in some of the categories but we have been able to capture a more than our fair share and that\u2019s been driving our overall revenue performance. Operator : Your next question comes from Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley. Matthew Grainger \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Just one regional question, I was hoping to get a bit more color on the weaker sales this quarter in Asia. I know you faced an easier prior-year comparison. You have been working through your issues in China for several quarters now and we hopefully are past the worst, but top line did decelerate further, which I'm guessing is attributable mostly to this Australia and New Zealand issue you called out. So is that the case? And if so, can you characterize the impact that's having, what's going on and what we should expect there over the balance of the year? Irene Rosenfeld : Let me start with the fact that actually through the first half as we said, China was actually massive headwind we were up about 8% year ago in the first half in 2013 in China and so that\u2019s a big headwind to us as we experienced some of the challenges that we said and that continues to be the biggest factor but certainly in the quarter some of what happened in Australia, New Zealand is just a essentially a consequence of some of the same pricing conversations that we have been having about our European customers and again it's something that we think will resolve itself as the year goes on. We did see some fairly significant destocking in some of our Australian customers and that was what caused some of the dislocation in the second quarter. Matthew Grainger \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Okay. But just to be clear, given some of your competitors over the years have had de-stocking issues that have been extremely difficult to resolve in that market, would you say you have an equivalent level of confidence that you would have in Europe going forward as far as getting those products back on shelf and resolving those quickly? Irene Rosenfeld : These are brands that have very strong market positions, they do drive traffic and quite frankly as we look at some of the inventory positions they are well below healthy level. So, it's reasonable confidence, again we\u2019re not necessarily predicting timing but we do expect that in the guidance that we have given to you we would expect to see that resolve itself in the coming months. Operator : Your next question comes from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow \u2013 Credit Suisse : Irene, I think it was a year and a half ago at CAGNY that you established some pretty bold targets for points of distribution gains in emerging markets. And since then there has been some SG&A overhead cuts. I wanted to make sure that you are comfortable that you can still achieve those distribution gains, despite the overhead reductions. And have you kept track of those goals? And where do you think you are tracking on them? And then I had a quick follow-up. Irene Rosenfeld : Absolutely Rob. I mean we\u2019re not cutting our investments in the emerging markets. We have significantly as you know last year we significantly stepped up our investments early in the year, many of that was much of that was in route to market and we are benefiting from those investments. We are continuing to make the necessary investments -- we\u2019re protecting sales to a large extent as we look at some of the overhead initiatives but the end in mind is to make sure that we are making the necessary foundational investments in these key markets to capitalize on the opportunities that will emerge as the economies recover. So we continue to feel good about the investments that we made in route to market, in places like Russia, like Brazil, like India and you will continue to see those investments and making sure that we\u2019re getting an adequate return but this is not about cutting back on those investments. This is again it's the focus is no headcount elsewhere in the world into a large extent as well as some non-people related overhead costs. Robert Moskow \u2013 Credit Suisse : Okay. And then the follow-up is you said that your share of voice is still at high levels. But you've shifted a lot of money into digital. And I'm sure your competitors have also. Are you comfortable that your ability to measure share of voice is still good? And are you able to measure digital in share of voice? And then also -- you know, you were in market research. Do you feel comfortable that the return you are getting on digital marketing is sufficient? Or is that still in its infancy in terms of measurement? Irene Rosenfeld : It's a fair question Rob, I have to tell you, we actually are quite able to measure the ROI of our digital investments and we\u2019re finding it's paying back about twice the rate of our traditional media investments not to mention the fact that we\u2019re seeing quite significant media inflation in a number of our emerging markets and so the benefits of going to digital as that explodes in markets like China and Brazil is a positive because that\u2019s where our consumers are. So I think the evidence that we have is quite compelling and it gives us great confidence that as we continue to shift our spending into digital that we will get actually an even better return on many of those investments Operator : Your next question comes from Alexia Howard of Sanford Bernstein. Alexia Howard \u2013 Sanford Bernstein & Company: Can I ask about the leadership changes that we've seen in China and India recently? I think recently you brought somebody in from the outside into China. We've seen some changes recently in India as well. What specifically were you looking for in terms of capabilities? How confident are you that you've got the right people in place now? Just any color that you can give us on that would be great. Thank you. Irene Rosenfeld : I feel quite good about the leaders that we have placed in both of those countries and in number of our other key emerging markets. As I mentioned India is performing well, continues to grow at a double digit rate and Manu Anand has have a great deal of experience in operating within that country and he has done a great job in continuing to drive the momentum in that market. China we mentioned that we brought in Stephen Maher. He is about four weeks old, I would say in his new role but he has got 16 years of SPG experience most of that -- much of that actually is in China and as a result he brings to t task a very great seasoning in a variety of the disciplines of general management as well as understanding the Chinese market and so I\u2019m quite confident that Stephen will be able to deliver on the ambitious agenda that we have in China. Alexia Howard \u2013 Sanford Bernstein & Company: And then just a quick follow-up, can you give us the run-rate or the current run-rate of gum in China? I think the last time you talked about it, it was about $100 million kind of level. Where are we now? Irene Rosenfeld : We\u2019re forecasting about 150 for the year, Alexia we\u2019re feeling quite good. We have got about 9% share and we are quite pleased with the performance of our gum business there. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Your next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Jason English \u2013 Goldman Sachs : There has been a lot of rhetoric about decelerating category growth on the call. You've given us some data in your slides, I guess it's slide 16, suggesting that your category growth, end market growth accelerated from 2.8% in the first quarter to around 3.8% for the full first half, suggesting in the quarter it may actually even have been approaching close to 5%. So is that the right way to think about it? If so, where is the disconnect with the data in the commentary? And also where are you seeing that acceleration from a market perspective? Dave Brearton : I think the slide we showed for the first half was about 3.8%, you\u2019re right, the first quarter was lower than that but it's basically Easter. So there was a big flip between March and April, huge actually and that\u2019s what\u2019s driving the second quarter to be a higher growth rate from the first quarter, the first half in aggregate is the best way to look at it and it's about 3.8%. And when we talk about the category slowdown I think we saw -- in North America we saw that, in a lot of the European markets, we saw it in a lot of the emerging markets as well particularly in the May-June months. So I think we can\u2019t really look at only one quarter given the Easter shift but clearly I think we wanted to make sure that we reflect that in the outlook we give you. Jason English \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Turning real quick to gum, I imagine you\u2019re not taking much price on gum, just given the cost basket there. Is that fair to say? Irene Rosenfeld : Yes it is. Jason English \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Yet in gum you are still lagging the market by a substantial chunk, down low-single digits. The market has turned up around 1% now through the first half. Why shouldn't we be concerned that there is something other than just price gaps and retailer pushback that is driving the market share weakness? Irene Rosenfeld : I think you need to look at that on a market by market basis Jas, and I talked about the performance in the U.S., we have had three quarters of solid share growth -- I have talked about what\u2019s going in China and our major gum markets were continuing to make good progress behind the initiatives that I have laid out and as I have said we\u2019re still not pleased with our gum performance, it is still negative year-over-year but the good news is that it's less negative and we\u2019re starting to see it moving in a better direction. Dave Brearton : And I think the two places that are negative, we talked about the positives, Europe is still negative and actually the other one probably surprise you, it's Venezuela because it's an important product and it's a struggle to get the currency. So the Venezuela volume is down quite a bit but those are really the two, they are offsetting a good numbers we\u2019re seeing in China and North America. Operator : Your next question comes from Jonathan Feeney of Athlos Research. Jonathan Feeney \u2013 Athlos Research : Over the course of the quarter, would you say that volume, particularly in developing markets, improved month-to-month? And is that what gives you confidence in the second half that this deceleration won't be sustained? It looks like you're guiding to for the full year in organic net rev, what you have done year-to-date, despite the decel first and second quarter? Or is it more the pricing side, maybe where you have a little bit more control, you know prices are going to be going up, and you know that the second half of the year -- I understand comps get a little bit easier in China. But they get a little bit tougher, particularly on a stacked basis, in the third and fourth quarter other places. So just parsing out those volume versus pricing in your net rev regime? I appreciate it. Irene Rosenfeld : Jon, again, pricing is the big variable here because you\u2019re correct in saying that we do see that it will pick up some tailwinds in the back half as we lap China and as we cycle the coffee as we see higher prices in coffee. That\u2019s going to be offset as we look at the outlook by the continuous slow category growth as well as the continued dislocation as our pricing makes its way through the system and those are the puts and takes but the big impact offsetting the tailwinds is really the pricing continually to play through and as we have said we would expect even in Q3 that we would expect our share performance will continue to soften as we work our way through some of these customer disputes and more of our pricing impact hits the shelves. We do believe this is temporary but it will have an impact, a continued impact in Q3. Jonathan Feeney \u2013 Athlos Research : And volume in Asia-Pac and Latin America, did that improve over the course of the quarter or can you say? Dave Brearton : I think the volume in Asia-PAC is primarily China item, a little bit Australia and then Latin America the volume is really two fold. It's Venezuela and Argentina with the hyperinflation there and that\u2019s been a sort of ongoing trade off on low-margin product as we've priced that away and Mexico to some degree as we adjust to the VAT. I think the important thing in Latin America is Brazil which is really our powerhouse continues to grow vol mix and most of the other countries do as well. So it's kind of Mexico VAT and it's Venezuela/Argentina which are kind of anomalies. Jonathan Feeney \u2013 Athlos Research : But can you say whether it improved over the course of the quarter? I'm just talking month to month. Did we leave June on a high note or did we leave just average? Dave Brearton : We left it where we expect it to be. I mean the China issues was really a question of comparisons to a year ago. It wasn\u2019t so much about improvements this year and I think last year we had a very strong June month so we were down in China year-over-year. I would expect with the absence of those tough comps going into Q3 we are pretty comfortable with the run-rate in China, is where it needs to be that the numbers we gave you today. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal. Ken Zaslow \u2013 Bank of Montreal : Just talking more about the things that you could do in your control, I know as you go through ZBB, a lot of times as I think through the process companies tend to find a greater deal of cost savings through this process. Can you talk about have you seen a greater opportunities than you initially thought? And at what point do you think there's a potential for an acceleration of even greater savings, because it seems like you guys have done, actually a pretty good job on this front? Irene Rosenfeld : Ken, I would say we have set some fairly aggressive targets. We have laid out our targets of approximately 300 to 400 basis points over the next three years and that\u2019s a fairly aggressive agenda. The good news is I would tell you as we continue to work our way through the specific initiatives I have great confidence that we will deliver those targets but I think the we just need to continue to make progress quarter-after-quarter. I\u2019m pleased as I said in the programs and the impact it has had in just even in our Q2 results and I think we still continue to see that play through. Ken Zaslow \u2013 Bank of Montreal : And just a follow-up, I know in parts of the business, are you actually adding infrastructure? I know you\u2019re adding a Growth Officer. Is there other levels that are somewhat being funded by this whole cost savings opportunity? Or was that always part of the plan of having maybe not another layer of management but another layer of infrastructure? Irene Rosenfeld : Simple answer is no, we\u2019re not adding a layer of infrastructure and in fact there is some puts and takes that go with the creation of the Chief Growth Officer role. But it is a fact that as we look at our opportunity within the context of the new operating model we\u2019re continuing to invest in sales and route to market and so we\u2019re taking disproportionately, we\u2019re taking some of our savings disproportionately from some of the other areas into the operation in favor of those key front line investments. So you will see that slide through but we\u2019re not creating another layer in with the creation of the Chief Growth Officer. Operator : Your final question comes from David Hayes of Nomura. David Hayes \u2013 Nomura: Two questions, if I can, first a broad one and then a specific one on Europe. Just in terms of the broader question, obviously you've got some moving parts in terms of the disappointment in terms of sales growth through the year. But is there any anxiety at all internally that there's too much demand on the cost saving side, the margin delivery side in the organization and that is what is basically defocusing the business from performing as well as maybe it could do more has done in terms of sales and market share delivery? And then the second question just going back to the EU, two things on this. Firstly, you mentioned France and then Europe interchangeably. Just to understand, is it just France that these issues are existing in terms of the retailers or where there are other markets as well? And then just in terms of the dynamic, you made the point yourself that the consumer off take is still good, that the shipments effectively are lagging now because of negotiations. To some extent you would have thought, with your brands being mass stock in many cases, to your point earlier, that you would just catch up the shipments and therefore the second half would bounce. So the question to some extent is that the dynamic? And is your guidance for the second half therefore very cautious in your view? And actually you could be better than the 2% \u2013 2.5% as that dynamic plays out? Thank you. Irene Rosenfeld : Let me answer your last two questions and then I will come back to the first. It is about France and should the shipments catch up? The simple answer is, we hope so. But the speed with which we resolved some of these disputes is kind of not something that I wanted to predict. So we believe in the guidance we have given to you, we have adequately reflected the reality that someday we will get ourselves through these conversations but we\u2019re not counting it necessarily happening tomorrow and so I hope that gives you some perspective on that question. With respect to the question of is there too much focus on margin and to what extent is that putting creating more pressure on our top line, there is question. We\u2019re doing a lot right now but I really do believe that it's much better to move quickly and decisively rather than leaving a lot of uncertainty out in the organization. We\u2019re certainly -- experiencing some disruption but our focus is to protect the long term health of our business and our ability to invest in our franchise and in our people. And so again we believe that the dislocation that we\u2019re experiencing is temporary, we will work our way through it but most importantly we believe we\u2019re doing the right things for the long term health of the business and as I mentioned our strategic initiatives are moving along on track consistent with what we had expected. Operator : This does conclude our question and answer session. I will now turn the floor back over to Mr. Congbalay for any closing remarks. Dexter Congbalay : Any follow-up questions Nick and I will be around for the rest of the day and we will be happy to take any callers or emails that you might have. Thanks everyone for joining us. Operator : Thank you. This concludes your conference. You may now disconnect.",

With that, I'll now turn the call over to Irene. Irene Rosenfeld : Thanks, Dexter, and good morning. I am pleased to report that we had a strong third quarter in an environment that continues to be challenging we delivered top tier earnings growth and margin expansion as well as solid revenue growth. Specifically organic revenue was up 2.7%, adjusted operating income margin increased 140 basis points to 13.6%, and adjusted EPS was $0.50 up 33% on a constant currency basis due largely by strong operating gains. This is the third consecutive quarter that we\u2019ve expanded margins by at least 100 basis points and posted doubled digit EPS growth We delivered this by successfully executing our productivity and supply chain initiatives and through early wins from our zero based budgeting program. The primary revenue driver in Q3 was pricing to offset higher input cost which contributed 5.8 percentage points to our growth. Our pricing actions were broad based spanning all categories and regions, though they were most significant in chocolate and coffee given the steep rise in both cocoa and green coffee cost. As expected, increased pricing and the wider price graphs that resulted pressured overall volume mix, which was down 3.1 percentage points. Volume mix was also affected by the pricing related customer disputes in France that we mentioned last quarter. We priced to fully recover commodity and currency see impacts and we took action earlier than our competition. As we discussed in our last earnings call, in the short term, this will temper revenue growth until gaps narrow and customers and consumers adapt to the higher prices. Fortunately, towards the end of the quarter, conditions started to improve. Most of the customer disputes have now been resolved and price gaps have began to narrow, especially in emerging markets. Overall, organic revenue grew 2.7%, driven by an increase of 9% in emerging markets. Some of that growth was due to China, which grew high single digits behind stepped up innovation and marketing as we lapped last year's inventory destock. Another factor was the impact of hyperinflationary markets. And we are very pleased that Brazil, Russia and India each posted double digit increases including solid contributions from vol mix and innovation. For instance, in Brazil, Oreo and belVita continued to perform well. In Russia, our Marvellous Creations platform captured a 1% share of the chocolate tablet market within its first month, while new Dirol flavors and innovative packaging drove share gains in gum. And in India, new pack sizes and formats for Cadbury Dairy Milk fuels double digit growth and strong share gains. In developed markets, organic revenue declined 1.3% as we continue to deal with an increasingly tough operating environment. That included temporary dislocations associated with pricing related customer disputes especially in Europe and increased promotions by competitors particularly in North America. In both cases, we chose to stand our ground to maintain the investments necessary to support our brands over the long-term.  Let's look more closely at our Q3 revenue by region. In Europe, which accounts for about 40% of our business, organic revenue was down 2.4%. The commercial dispute accounted for more than a 100 basis points of the decline. In Q4, we expect less of a headwind from these disputes. As I mentioned earlier over the past month we've reached agreements with most of our customers though we did lose some distribution with a few of them. In addition and as expected, the elasticity impact of higher pricing significantly tempered our volumes. This was especially true in coffee where for the first time in two years, we increased prices. As expected consumers and customers reduced pantry and trade stocks after the price increase which affected volumes. So, coffee revenue was a 50 basis point headwind in Europe.  In North America. organic revenue was essentially flat for the quarter. U.S biscuits up-low single digits, a big slower than last quarter but in line with the category as we cycled strong prior year growth. This was offset by a decline in confections. In EMEA, organic revenue grew 5.6%. Russia led the way with mid-teens growth including double digit gains in coffee, chocolate and biscuits. I recently visited our team in Russia and in the phase of significant macro-economic headwinds, they are doing an exceptional job of defying gravity and growing well in excess of GDP. Russia's performance is more than offset weakness in other markets in the region that are experiencing political and economic instability. Latin America grew 18.5%, the fifth straight quarter of double-digit growth. Brazil delivered another strong quarter up mid-teens with positive vol mix despite significant pricing. Growth in Brazil was broad based. Biscuits, chocolate, powder beverages and gum and candy, all posted strong gains. The inflationary economies of Argentina and Venezuela continued to drive the sharp rise in pricing for the region overall. And finally, Asia Pacific returned to growth this quarter with organic revenue up 1.3%. China grew nearly 10% as we cycled last year's inventory destocking and began to see the impact of our turnaround plan. Although the macro environment remains soft, we are seeing early signs of success with our reinvigorated marketing and innovation programs. For example we recently introduced innovations such as Oreo Thins and Mini Oreos as well as new packaging formats to broaden usage occasions. We also adapted some proven marketing programs from our global playbook such as the Oreo WONDERFILLED campaign. In response, biscuit category growth in China has kicked up recently and our share trends have also improved. Beyond, China India delivered another quarter of double digit growth behind strong gains in chocolate and Australia and New Zealand grow low single digits as the retail environment stabilized.  Now let's have a look at category growth. Overall global category growth remain below long-term trends. Year-to-date growth for our snacks categories was around 4% and stood at about 3.5% for all of our categories including beverages, cheese and grocery. Our organic revenue grew 2.2% over that same period, in line with our annual guidance but a little more than a point below category growth. This difference is primarily due to three things, the elasticity impact of significant chocolate pricing, the impact of the customer disputes in France across a number of our categories and the cycling of the investments we made in China biscuits last year. In Q4, we expect the impact of chocolate pricing and the residual effect of the French trade dispute to continue. These factors are built into our full year revenue guidance. Turning to market share, overall year-to-date performance remained solid with 54% of our revenues gaining or holding share. Given that we increased pricing in all of our categories, shares softened a bit in Q3 to about 49% as we had expected. As we exit the year, we expect our shares to stabilize as consumers adjust to new price points and gaps begin to narrow.  So to summarize, we delivered solid top line growth in a challenging consumer and customer environment. In the phase of this temporary period, a weaker category growth, we've made a conscious decision to increase prices to recover higher input cost even if we have to accept some near term share loss. At the same time, we're continuing to invest in high return route to market and capacity expansion projects, while driving productivity and cost reduction to increase earnings, expand margins and fuel further growth. Near term, leveraging this approach through 2015, we'll deliver value to our shareholders regardless of the macro environment. And over the long term, this will enable us to deliver sustainable top tier performance on both the top and bottom lines. With that, let me turn it over to Dave. Dave Brearton :  Thanks Irene. Good morning. Over the next few slides, I'll walk you through our bottom line results and our updated outlook. Adjusted gross profit dollars were up 3.1% and adjusted gross profit margin increased 40 basis points. We continue to deliver productivity at record levels. Year-to-date we generated net productivity of more than 2.5%. Costs increased high single digits in the quarter due primarily to coffee, cocoa and currency. Forex actually drove about half of that increase primarily in emerging markets. We priced to recover these costs on a dollar basis, with pricing contributing nearly 6% points in the quarter. Of course with this level of pricing, the percentage margin was negatively affected by what we call the denominator effect. But our strong productivity programs and a modest mark-to-market benefit allowed us to expand gross margins in the quarter.  Now let's take a closer look at operating income. As Irene mentioned earlier, we've now posted our third consecutive quarter of significant adjusted OI margin expansion since we outlined our supply chain and cost reduction initiatives. Specifically, adjusted OI dollars increased 16.5% in the third quarter and we're up 14.7% year-to-date on a constant currency basis. Adjusted OI margin was 13.6% up a 140 basis points in Q3. Year-to-date, adjusted OI margin has increased to 130 basis points to 12.8%. Our margin expansion was mainly driven by lower overheads, as we're beginning to see the benefits of our ZBB program playing through the P&L. Changes in our spending policies are already making a difference in overheads, and we expect these savings to continue to build as we enter 2015. In addition we're continuing to drive AMC efficiencies by reducing non working cost like advertising production. And the consolidation of our agency and media provider especially in emerging markets like EMEA and Asia-Pacific is providing real savings to our bottom line. Importantly our working media investment and the level of consumer engagement remains in line with prior year, as we continue to invest in our brands at a healthy rate. And within our working media, we're continuing to shift more of our global media spending to digital, which delivers about twice the ROI of traditional media.  Taking a closer look at margins, it's encouraging to see the breadth of our margin expansion. Through September, all five of our regions delivered higher margins versus the prior year. North America and Europe each delivered approximately 200 basis points of margin improvement. Not surprisingly these two regions are delivering the lion share of our margin expansion, as they're the primary focus of our supply chain work and overhead cost programs. But Latin America, EMEA and Asia-Pacific also delivered higher margins for the first nine months.  Turning to EPS, our margin improvement is also driving strong EPS growth. Through the first nine months, our adjusted EPS was $1.29 up 22% on a constant currency basis. Operating gains are the key driver accounting for 19 of the $0.25 of improvement on a constant currency basis year-to-date. Lower interest expense and the impact of share buybacks provided another $0.12 of upside more than offsetting a $0.06 headwind as we had last year\u2019s exceptionally low tax rate. Let me now quickly update you on where we stand on capital allocation and cash flow. With regard to free cash flow, we remain on track to deliver our two year target of $3.7 billion. Our growth and earnings coupled with our continued focus on improving working capital are the primary drivers. Through September, our cash conversion cycle improved approximately 21 days consistent with year-to-date performance. We have also returned over $1.9 billion for our shareholders including repurchasing $1.2 billion of stock or about 34 million shares. Based on this, we now expect our total share repurchases for 2014 to be between $1.2 billion and $2 billion. Additionally, we paid at a little over $700 million in dividends. Turning to our outlook, although Q3 revenue came in better than expected we\u2019re maintaining our top line outlook. Global economic conditions and the category growth remain challenging and while we reach agreements to resolve most of our customer disputes, we remain cautious about residual impact on Q4; however, we are raising our guidance on adjusted operating income and margin based on our strong performance through the first nine months. Adjusted operating income on a constant currency is now expected to grow approximately 10%, up from high single digits previously, and adjusted OI margin is now projected at approximately 13% versus the high 12s we guided to early this year. Our confidence in delivering the higher OI margin target is routed in our strong margin expansion year-to-date as well as our visibility to the pipeline of cost and productivity savings for the balance of the year. We are also increasing our adjusted EPS range by $0.09 to $1.82 to $1.87 on a constant currency basis, up from the previous range of $1.73 to $1.78. This includes about $0.06 from the lower than expected effective tax rate reflecting a number of favorable discrete tax events. For the year, we estimated effective tax rate in the high teens versus our prior expectations of around 20%. Our strong operating performance added $0.01 to $0.02. The remaining $0.01 to $0.02 comes from favorable interest expense. In our revised guidance, we\u2019ve included a similar benefit in the fourth quarter. At this point, I want to pause for a moment to thank Irene, the Board and the leadership team and specially all of the people on my finance team based around the world for the opportunity to serve as CFO and the for the tremendous support over the years. As you know, this is my last earnings call as CFO on December 1st, I\u2019ll assume new role that focuses primary on the establishment and launch of our coffee joint venture with D.E Master Blenders. I would also like to this opportunity to welcome Brian Gladden as our incoming CFO who joining us at an exciting time as we accelerate our growth and cost agendas. Brian is a seasoned financial leader who knows how to create shareholder value. His background together with extensive experience operating in emerging market and developing talent will greatly benefit our global organization and our shareholders. With that, let me hand it over to Brian for a few words. Brian Gladden : Thanks, Dave, it\u2019s really great to be here. I am very excited to join the team and I look forward to helping our company reach its potential. We have an aggressive transformation agenda underway and I am thrilled to help lead that effort going forward. Dave and I have already been working together very closely to ensure smooth transition and I look forward to meeting many of you in the near future. With that, let me turn it back to Irene for a quick update on our strategic initiatives. Irene Rosenfeld : Thanks, Brian. Let me add my welcome to you and also to extend my heartfelt thanks to Dave who has been a terrific partner over the years, but of course Dave is not off the hook which is a good segway to a review of our strategic initiatives which remain firmly on track. First our planned coffee joint venture is moving ahead and we continue to expect the deals to close in 2015. We are making progress in securing regulatory approvals as well as engaging with our work councils. As you can imagine, there is still a lot to do at this stage of the business for continued success so I am very pleased that Dave will be able to focus on this project at this critical juncture. Second, we continue to advance our goal to deliver best-in-class cost in both our supply chain and in overhead. On the supply chain reinvention front in the next few weeks, we\u2019ll open our newest Greenfield biscuit plant in Salinas, Mexico, right on schedule. As we\u2019ve said in the past, this plant will provide 1000 basis points of margin improvement for products made there, compared to our existing network and we recently announced a $90 million investment in a new biscuit plant in Bahrain to support regional growth. We are in the midst of our first annual budget process leveraging our new ZBB toolkit and revised cost policies. I can tell you that ZBB is having desired impact on our culture. We\u2019re pushing our teams to make the tradeoffs to budget at a very granular level and challenge old ways of thinking. This sets the stage for a best-in-class cost structure and further margin improvement over the next few years. Finally as you know this past May we announced the adoption of a category led model in all of our regions starting January 1st, 2015. This operating model will deliver improvement in both our top and bottom lines by accelerating launches of proven innovations around the world by clarifying and streamlining decision making, by reducing cost through simplification, standardization and scale and by building world class capabilities and operating discipline. This is a significant change in how we run the business, especially in our emerging markets. Right now we are staging the new organization for launch. We've announced all the leaders of the region category structure and their staffs. And in the coming weeks, we will be working to ensure that the new organization is in place to deliver our 2015 plan. As you can imagine all of this transformation work is quite an undertaking. But big change is something we do very well here. I am quite confident in our ability to successfully implement these initiatives to get this company fit to win regardless of the macro-environment and to deliver sustainable profitable growth over the long-term. With that, let me open it up now for your questions. Operator :  (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Andrew Lazar - Barclays:  Two questions from me. First on last quarter's call, it sort of seemed like organic sales growth in the third quarter would be probably more similar to 2Q given all the issues that you had discussed on the call. It came in better and you did hold your, full year organic sales target range kind of steady. I am just trying to get a sense of do this suggest you potentially feel better about the upper end of that 2% to 2.55% range or not. And the reason I ask is you have an easier comp in 4Q. And if you would hit the lower end of a range that would imply a sort of a sequential deceleration in organic sales in the fourth quarter. I am just trying to get a sense if there be any reasons we should expect that? Dave Brearton :  Andrew, its Dave. I think year to date our organic growth is 2.2%. So it's about middle of that range year-to-date. As we look at quarter four, I think a lot of the stuff we talked about on this call for quarter three; we would expect to continue on. Global category growth is probably not going to change especially in Europe where other consumers are under a bit more pressure. Competition has price, particularly on chocolate in our emerging markets, but in Europe they haven't yet price and it doesn\u2019t look like they will through quarter four. And while as Irene said, we resolved the French disputes in Europe and the process we lost a little bit of distribution in a few customers and some of those disputes were only resolved in October. So you are going to see all of those factors carry forward into Q4. So we just felt it was prudent to keep our full year guidance of the 2% to 2.5% range. Andrew Lazar - Barclays:  Thanks for that. And then secondly, I certainly understand the impact around the math of higher pricing on the gross margin percentage and such. But I guess, I am just trying to get a sense of such a big part of the story going forward is really as organic sales growth accelerates, it should happen on in even more compelling cost structure and then the earnings leverage that comes from that. And I guess I would have thought with all the productivity that you are generating. We would have still seen more underlying gross margin improvement. So trying to get a sense if there is anything else at work there that was a headwind or was it really as you see it purely the math of the pricing? Dave Brearton : Yes. The simple answer is the math of the pricing. Our commodity costs and Forex impacts in the quarter were up in the high single digit, so a very big number. We price to fully recover that in dollar terms and that's why you saw the 6% pricing come through and we were able to get that in the market while maintaining good performance on our shares. But the simple math is if we are maintaining $1 margin on a 6% price increase is that you end up with this denominator effect and it was quite material in the quarter. Our net productivity as you pointed out was at record levels. We've never had better than net productivity of 2.5%. And that did drop through, that provide a gross margin dollar growth and it allowed us to fully offset that denominator impact and drive a little bit of gross margin gain. So I understand the question but we are actually quite happy that we grew gross margins in the phase of high single digit commodity and Forex impacts in the quarter. As we go forward, I don't think we will see those kind of costs and price increases every year. I think that equation of pricing recovered dollars and using productivity to cover the percentage impact and still drive give us fuel to drive growth will result in gross margins increasing over time and you are right, it's a key part of why we believe we can get to the 15% to 16% OI margins by 2016. Operator :  Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Ken Goldman - JPMorgan:  Hey good morning everybody. Dave best of luck going forward. Brian I don't know if you are available for questions but I am curious how you would describe your style in general, what do you think your strengths are as a CFO, what do you think you bring to the company your new role? And then also when you left Dell you quoted as saying that you do have a desire to run a company. So I am curious, how that corresponds with your new role, it\u2019s a huge responsibility but it\u2019s not running the shebang so to speak. So I am just trying to understand your personal goals and how that corresponds with that quote a little better. Dave Brearton :  Hey, Ken thanks. I would start by saying obviously great to be here, just getting started enjoying the transition and the time with Dave to really learn the business. For me this is a terrific opportunity to be part of building something great here and I would just say I'm very excited, I think I expect I'll have the chance to spend some time with you guys over the next quarter or two and at that point I'll be able to share some early thoughts on sort of how I think about the business and how you'll see my role playing out, but I'm extremely excited to be the CFO and partner with Irene here to drive the company going forward. Ken Goldman - JPMorgan:  So you're you good in answering questions politically, I like that. And then Irene, part of the margin and maybe this is a better question for Dave but part of the margin growth story depends on plants around the world closing and opening in line with your schedule, can you update us on progress here, have been any delays or is everything on pace with kind of what you anticipated? Irene Rosenfeld : No actually we're feeling quite good about the pace, obviously the most important next big investment was in Salinas and as I mentioned we're very pleased with the progress and we're about to have that plant up and running. As we look around the rest of the world everything is pretty much on schedule, the one place that we're continuing to be keep a watch on is that we have a plant in Siberia that's about to come on stream in the next year and a half and we'll continue to keep our eyes on that as we watch the political situation there but net-net we're very much on track with all of the supply chain reinvention initiatives that we laid out, and as you know that's going to be a big part of our gross margin improvement going forward. Operator :  Our next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank. Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank :  Good morning everybody, Dave best of luck. Dave Brearton :  Hi Eric. Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank : Okay, couple of questions. How much was total advertising and promotion down in the quarter? Dave Brearton :  I think it was down a 100% due to the productivity efforts we mentioned our working media was actually dead flat versus year ago so we continue to spend the same amount of time there. In terms of the productivity impacts, I don't think, I'm not sure I want to give you that number right now, but I can tell you it is below the 9% rate that we recorded in the past but it's all been based on the agency consolidation and the ZBB approach we took to the non working media. So we're pretty confident that we kept the investment at the level it needs to be. Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank : It looked like if your product I'm kind of wondering how much came out of Europe, because your product is not on the shelf or a small percentage of what it was, why would you advertise there if you don't have product on shelf, I mean was that a material factor in the quarter? Dave Brearton :  No, not really. That was really a French issue so one country in Europe, one of the most important things as you go through these pricing periods is that you continue to support the brands because you got to make sure you've got the consumer poll to help drive that pricing through both the customers and get the consumers over the price shot. So we very much focused on maintaining our working media investments in Europe and frankly globally. Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank : All right, and then Irene, most companies have been reporting very slower growth in Brazil, Russia is a big question mark, China slowing down and yet you're reporting very strong growth in those markets almost no elasticity in Latin America despite close to 20% pricing, the company has a history of over-shipping consumption, why should we be comfortable that that these volumes performances are okay? Irene Rosenfeld :  Well Eric, I would tell you Eric is that there is no question we are doing better than our categories in a number of these markets, we're very pleased with the impact that our marketing support has had that our innovation programs are having and that's been a key driver of our ability to outgrow the markets. We continue to watch the performance of the macro economy in key markets like Russia to make sure that our inventories are properly balanced and as I've shared with you in the past, we've got very good visibility and to that to make sure that our sell out and sell in are properly balanced, so we're very pleased with the performance of our businesses in some of these markets where the macro economies have suffered, but I think it's partly because we're taking a number of steps to control our own destiny in those markets with respect to the marketing support and the inputs that we're providing. Dave Brearton :  And I think Eric, just to follow on that. The categories in our BRIC markets are holding up surprisingly well as the GDP is pretty dismal in a lot of those markets but surprisingly our categories remain strong growing roughly in the mid single digit. And we gained share in most of the categories we compete in the BRIC markets, so we got to watch it very carefully, a couple of years ago we did have some examples of over-shipping in China, but I think as we look at it today we kept pretty tight control on the trade stock situation. We're very aware that the categories are sort of defined gradually at this point we're watching it very closely that I think we're probably a key part of the innovation and investments Irene mentioned. Eric Katzman - Deutsche Bank : Great, and then if I could sorry, just one more Dave before you go, something I always asked about, but nine months using your own press release nine months free cash flow is only 40 million yet you've reported 2.2 billion of adjusted net income and you\u2019re saying that you are still going to get to the 3.7 billion over the two years, I look like working capital was a massive use in the quarter. How do you bridge that gap and deliver? I don\u2019t see how fourth quarter can be such a big positive swing versus almost no cash flow year-to-date or free cash flow, I should say? Dave Brearton : The $3.7 billion was a number that excluded a couple of key items. It excluded the Starbucks gain last year 1.7 billion after tax. It excluded the actual tax payments on that Starbucks gain and excluded the debt tender class of that we use that gain to be able to execute given the tax situation that gave us, so included restructuring, it included all the other noise, but I think specially around those items tied to the Starbucks gain it was not part of that. I think if you included all those things 3.7 would actually be higher, but within that Starbucks gain obviously came last year and roughly $800 million of the tax payment on Starbucks gain and the debt tender cost in the first quarter this year. So if you take all that out, we would be up about 800 million on the quarter and that gives well on track to the 1.4 billion we needed to get the 2 year 3.7 billion target. If you want all throw all that back in we would have a much higher cash flow target, than we have talked about in the past last year and it would balance out a bit some of those spending this year. But we\u2019re well on track, I mean, our cash flow we\u2019re quite happy with where we are. The working capital is up versus December 31st but that\u2019s normal. December, due to the seasonality of our business is always our lowest working capital quarter and it always has been and September actually is leading into the heavy quarter for season. So we have higher inventories and we started to see higher receivables come through in September. So that\u2019s a fairly normal situation. When you look at it on a day\u2019s basis, we\u2019re down as I said on the earlier about 20 days on our cash conversion cycle, so the working capital performance has been quite good. But when you compare it to December, you\u2019ll always see working capital increase particularly third quarter and tends to the peak. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse : Thank you very much and David best wishes to you. I guess when I look at how this year is progressing gross profit dollars will actually be down for the year but David you said that there has been a lot of productivity gains and that you\u2019re on track in your supply chain reinvention, so I guess I wanted to know if you could help us quantify what those productivity benefits are and maybe explain why they\u2019re not improving gross profit dollars just yet? And then secondly on the SG&A, it\u2019s very encouraging to see so much productivity on SG&A line, I just wanted to get a sense of what we can expect for next year on that line because some of these advertising efficiency improvements it\u2019s hard to see how you can do that in two years in a row but would love to see how ZBB is going to help? Thanks. Dave Brearton : I guess on the first one, gross margin is down on a reported basis due to currency really. So currency obviously impacts the entire P&L and it does result in gross margin, dollar came down on a dollar basis. But I think if you strip out currency on a constant currency basis, as we said earlier, we\u2019re up about 3% on dollar basis. And that is a reflection of fully pricing to recover those commodities in Forex impact, which was a big number. And net productivity coming through at 2.5% of cost to goods sold, which is a record number and that really is the reason we\u2019re able to grow our gross margins and that\u2019s the reason we are fairly confident that we can continue to thrive margin growth going forward and offset pricing impact. So we actually feel very good about the gross margin. I think you\u2019re looking at a reported Forex basis when we say it\u2019s down. On the SG&A, I think the ZBB process as Irene said is really, it started this year around mostly just making people aware and trying to take its new approach to looking at things. We\u2019re in our first cycle of building budget that way, so I think we\u2019d expect to the savings continue and build into 2015. Specifically on the A&C line, you\u2019re right I think most of the low hanging fruit would have come this year, but will be a carryover benefit to some of that carrying over to next year when we get the full year benefit. But I think you will see more of the ZBB savings on the overhead line and less A&C next year, but I think if we\u2019ll build as we go through the year as well. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse : Do you have a top line or a top down target for ZBB savings for next year kind of like something that you\u2019re thinking of? Dave Brearton : We do but we\u2019re not going to give you on 2015 guidance today. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets : Another years not over yet but it feels like the majority the EBIT margin growth this year has been and will be SG&A productivity, wondering heading into the next year will those changes internally which may have been distracting, are you getting past what perhaps might have been traumatic or at least appear to change in internal review for you marking selling function as well general overhead function, and perhaps getting more on your front foot as you head into 15, any comments on that would be helpful? Thanks. Irene Rosenfeld : I think there is no question we\u2019re starting to see the result of all of our transformation initiatives coming together and I think we\u2019re feeling very good about the progress that we have made year-to-date. And as I said in my remarks, we don\u2019t expect a dramatic change in the macro-environment as we look ahead so that we anticipate continuing to leverage this approach. So I think it's clearly we are beginning to make consciousness cost reduction productivity a part of the DNA, we are starting to see it play through, it's a critical piece and a critical driver of our margins as we look ahead. And I had every confidence that that will continue to play through as we look to the future. The facts are though we haven't begun yet to implement the new organization model which I mentioned will happen as of January 1st 2015 and I think that will be a further help to our overall ability to deliver the targets that we've laid out. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets : And then separately in the United States how would you explain the slowing that we are seeing in the U.S. biscuit category in cookies and crackers. Do you have any thoughts there? Irene Rosenfeld :  We had a really strong run in our biscuit business and I am very pleased with the performance that they've delivered. Our revenue has been growing about 4% to 5% for the past couple of years and it has been driven by some fabulous marketing execution as well as a very strong DSD selling organization. We are seeing a category growth slowing from about 2% to 3% but we've been outgrowing the category for quite some time it\u2019s now down about 1% to 2% and we think that's probably likely to be a factor in the near term as the consumer particularly in North America wrestles with the tough economy that some of these are discretionary purchases and we think it has some impact on our categories. Our focus is going to be continuing to innovate and drive our share within that larger macro-economy as well as continuing to make very significant progress on the margin front. Operator :  Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  Hey, good morning and Dave congratulations, wish you well going forward. I had a question sort of following up on some of the items that people are focused on this morning on just gross profits and gross margins. And so I guess couple of things I would like to get some comments on first, just how much of your commodity exposure is currently locked in for this year and is there anything that's kind of locked in for next year. Just trying to get a sense on visibility on commodity costs? Dave Brearton :  Yes, I don\u2019t think we will give you our hedging policy that would cross the line but I think it's fair to say that for this year we are a 100% locked in, there is really not much exposure. I think on our commodity coverage, our strategy is to cover until we believe we can price. That tends to be how we do our commodity and Forex coverage decisions. And the only caveat for that is in many emerging markets, it's quite difficult to get some of the currency hedges you'd like to get in place. But that's our overall strategy is to try to hedge until we can price. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then I guess looking at just the foreign currency transaction impact that really wasn't very much of a factor in Q3. Is that a potential headwind for 2015 or even for 4Q in 2015 going forward? Dave Brearton :  Actually the foreign currency transaction impact is what we talk about when we say our commodity and we are going to price away commodities and Forex impacts. That is Forex transaction and that was about half of the high single digit cost increase I referred to. So it was material primarily in emerging markets obviously with some of the latest moves over the last month that will become more of a factor in Europe but it already has been a significant factor in cost movement this year. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then in terms of pricing, have you already priced, have you basically taken all the pricing you need so far based on what you know in terms of commodity costs and FX transactions. Obviously now knowing what's going to happen down the road. Just trying to make a sense is you've been putting pricing in for the second quarter, the third quarter. From now are you primarily done with that or is there still more new pricing that has to be instituted? Dave Brearton : It varies a lot by market and category but the I guess two parts of we have announced more price increases in some markets but none of that is required to hit the quarter four, so that's more about making sure we continue to stay on the cost curve as we go into next year. So that there is more pricing coming through but it\u2019s not necessary to hit the quarter four guidance we just gave you. Operator :  Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll of Citi Research. David Driscoll - Citi:  Great, thank you and good morning everyone. Dave I would like to add my congratulations and best of luck on the new role and I appreciate all the assistance over the years. What I would like to ask you is Irene on the margin front, and I think you've said this before but I get this question all the time, is the weak volume environment, does it concern you to a degree of being able to achieve your long-term margin targets? Irene Rosenfeld : David, I feel quite confident as we think about our long-term strategy. We are confident that we will be able to deliver top-tier revenue and earnings growth. We have very strong categories even when they slow down, they are still growing faster than most other food categories. Our brands are strong, we have strong market positions in our key markets and we've got a very good geographic footprint particularly with respect to emerging market. So I think the fundamental elements that we have that comprise our portfolio will still suggest that we have the potential to grow at a very healthy rate over the long-term. In this challenging environment though we have chosen to focus on what we can control and that is driving productivity and aggressive cost reduction and that's what's fueling our earnings in the short term. So over the long term I feel quite confident that we've got the right element to be able to deliver top tier growth on both of the top and bottom lines, but in the near term while we see the macro-economy in its current condition, we're choosing to focus on what we can control which is primarily the cost. David Driscoll - Citi:  Well maybe if I could you said a lot right there, so maybe if I could just clarify as best I can is that the 15% to 16% margin target is predominantly based upon things that you can control internally and that with year to date volumes down I think its 1.8% that's not a killer in being able to achieve those targets, is that just a fair statement? Irene Rosenfeld :  That is a fair statement, as I've said in my remarks, we do not expect a dramatic change in the macro-environment or in our trends and therefore we anticipate continuing to leverage the approach that is working so well for us right now as we head into 2015 that said we're continuing to make the necessary and high return foundational investment so that as our markets recover particularly in the emerging markets we're able to benefit from that but I would suggest obviously we're not giving a 2015 guidance today but I would say that the algorithm and the approach that we're taking here is serving us well and will serve us well for the foreseeable future. David Driscoll - Citi:  One last one for me, just a little one, I think you said that China saw mid single digit growth there and those numbers have been very volatile because of last year's Golden Oreo launch the quarterly numbers have been very volatile, is the right way to think about China at this point kind of a mid single digit grower going forward at least in the next handful of quarters is that a reasonable way to think about China now? Irene Rosenfeld :  No I'm not going to give market by market guidance, but I would say that this is an unusual quarter because of the year ago comp in terms of the inventory destock, so as I said we're starting to see some early signs of success and response for our marketing programs, we expect that that will build, but it's going to be a slow build, we've got some work to do in China. Operator :  Our next question comes from the line of Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs :  Hey good morning folks. First quick housekeeping item, can you give us some of the puts and takes that are going to weigh on EPS for the fourth quarter, your guidance sort of suggest that it's going to be down a couple of cents year on year? Dave Brearton :  Yes, I think essentially what we're projecting for the fourth quarter would be interest roughly in line of with what you saw in the third quarter. The tax rates probably around the 20 low 20s range, because we don\u2019t see a lot of the discrete items coming in the fourth quarter and operating income margin mathematically to get to around 13% in the year would need to be in the high 13s, so that's kind of the composition of the quarter four. Jason English - Goldman Sachs : That's helpful. I want to turn to productivity, I know there's been a lot of questions on this, but your Mexican facility coming online, can you give us a sense of how much volume or what percentage of your volume in the North America and Lat-Am's going to be flowing to this facility and then once this comes online, what are the next steps in terms of attacking your legacy North American infrastructure? Dave Brearton :  I think we've done a fair bid there, what we said about the Salinas facility it's all about growth volume so what is going into that facility is growth on our core Oreo, belVita and Ritz lines and that's really how we're going to fill up those pipelines three of them are coming up this quarter. So that is that's really what that is about, so the vast majority of the volume will still come out of the legacy facility, beyond that though we also announced earlier this year that we would be closing the Philadelphia's facility and investing money in both our Richmond and Fairmont facilities to upgrade those legacy facilities. So I think our margin improvement program in North America is for Salinas but also making sure we have the right network here in the U.S. Jason English - Goldman Sachs : Okay and real quick last one, gum, it's been a while since you guys talked about the category how it's doing and how you're doing in the category, can you give us an update? Irene Rosenfeld :  Gum is about 8% of our revenue today and about half of it today is now in emerging markets and the good news is that the category continues to be generally quite robust in the emerging markets, if you look at our year-to-date trends they're not as strong as because of the net impact of the Mexican VAT on the gum category if you recall it's about a 16% VAT which obviously in the short term's having a profound impact on the Mexican gum category, but in aggregate ex-Mexico, our emerging markets are growing over 5%, so we feel quite good about the profile in the emerging markets and we are starting to see the impact of a number of our near term programs on our share performance over half of our shares are growing or holding and particularly in China which is the basically the number two gum market in the world, we continue to see very strong performance that's going to be about a $150 million business for us this year. So net-net we haven't solved the longer term macro trends in developed markets, but as our shifts increasingly to the emerging markets, we feel quite confident that we'll continue to benefit from the growth there. Operator :  Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley. Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley :  Just echo what everyone else said and good luck to Dave. First question, just on the regions, on Asia specifically, organic sales growth was up 1.3%, but China was up high single. Australia/New Zealand was positive. India was quite strong. So just trying to reconcile those -- the importance of those markets and curious what other markets or factors weighed on the overall region and how sustainable those issues might be? Dave Brearton : I think the other two areas of the region would be Japan which is primarily the market and I think the category we did very well on share, but the category then decline and probably we\u2019ll continue to decline because of aging population demographics. And other one is Southeast Asia and I think the news in the quarter there was around Malaysia and there was a report that was inaccurate that said our chocolate wasn\u2019t Halal and that caused their volumes to go down and then third quarter in Malaysia, we\u2019re in the process of working through that and clarifying with our consumer but nothing really has changed, but it has an impact on the very quarter shipments. So those would be the two other items in Asia. Matthew Grainger - Morgan Stanley : Okay, thanks, Dave. Brian, if I could ask you one other quick question, if it's one you can answer. Even though you are not formally in the CFO role yet, now that you have been named to the post, are you actively involved in the 2015 budget process and the ongoing process of assessing the business outlook and setting guidance? Brian Gladden : Absolutely, I mean, we spent the last couple of weeks in a lot of deeper views really focused 2015, so that\u2019s been a primary focus, and David and I have spent a lot of time together. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard of Sanford Bernstein. Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein : Can I ask about the impact of SKU rationalization? I know I guess this time last year, there was a comment that you were starting with 74,000 SKUs globally and an expectation that would be reduced quite significantly over the next two or three years. Is that hitting your topline today? Will it continue to hit somewhat over the next year or so? Can you give us any idea, now that you are a year into this rationalization, just how much those numbers might come down over time? Thank you. Dave Brearton : I think the rationalization we\u2019ve talked about is probably most advanced in Europe and yes it is included in both results as well as the guidance we gave going forward. I would expect us to continue to do that. Any good company is just good housekeeping that continued cleaning up SKUs and so I think you\u2019ll continue to see those things and any guidance that we give you will include the impact of that SKU rationalization. Alexia Howard - Sanford Bernstein : But given that -- I think there was a conversation about meaningful 20%, 30% reductions, in some cases. Do you have an idea about what the endpoint here is or what the number could go down to over the longer term? Dave Brearton : I think our comment on the 20% to 30% was specifically around the couple of programs we had in Europe and we\u2019re on track to deliver that. I don\u2019t think we give any total SKU number, but I think you can expect us to take kind of European program and apply that logic elsewhere. And importantly SKU reduction can result in top line impact. It can actually just clean up the shelves and help us drive growth going forward, so it isn\u2019t necessarily a revenue hit, it can be and if it was to some degree this year in Europe, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be. So we\u2019ll continue to apply those principles are actually quite tightly to the supply chain reinvention program we\u2019ve gotten. The key part of is enabling Daniel Myers to streamline the network. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal. Ken Zaslow - Bank of Montreal : I just had two quick follow-up questions. One is last quarter; you guys reduced the OI growth rate. Now you are actually going and actually raising it. Can you isolate one to three reasons of what are the major changes of going from one quarter to another quarter in terms of the outlook on that? Dave Brearton : I think last quarter what we did is we called down our revenue guidance and we kept our margin guidance. So mathematically that means we have to reduce our OI growth rate. This quarter we kept the revenue guidance, we had very good margin performance in quarter 3 and we essentially said we think we can keep that and carry that forward in the quarter 4 and we increased margin guidance. So I think we\u2019re just frankly keeping you up-to-date as the world unfolds our guidance today is really around sticking up to 2% to 2.5% revenue growth rate on the top line and taking our margins up around 13% on the OI level and that results in the higher OI growth rate. Ken Zaslow - Bank of Montreal : Let me ask it another way. Did you accelerate the ZBB? Is there something that came in earlier than expected? Was there a little bit less elasticity? Was there certain rebound in emerging markets or something that has happened at all during the quarter that has changed your view, particularly on the ZBB side? Dave Brearton : I think ZBB is probably the thing I would think a lot with saying we\u2019ve had a good performance in overhead all year. But I think we\u2019re making better progress year to date and then we originally expect this to get the single out one thing that caused us to raise our margin guidance this year that would be it. Ken Zaslow - Bank of Montreal : Then my final question is, can you give us an update on the size of the gaps, where they were -- or some key markets, and where they stand now and where you hope them to be? What are the actual progress of the price gaps, because you said that has actually come in in emerging markets, and I was just curious to see what the progression has been and are you at the state where you need to be? Dave Brearton : I think two answers to that. In the emerging markets, we priced when commodity and Forex impact hit, many of our competitors either didn\u2019t price or price significantly later than we did that\u2019s mostly trued up by now. The price gaps in emerging markets are largely back in line the competition either priced or downsized to reflect the cost increases. Where it is still out of line would be in European chocolates where we have priced to reflect the quantity and Forex impacts and most of the competition has not and so we\u2019re still out of line in Europe. On those we would expect overtime the competition will need to reflect the realities at the new cost levels. But as we sit here today, there is still a price gaps in European chocolate, that's the one outlier. I think the rest of the business feels pretty good. Operator :  Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the allotted time for question-and-answers. I will now turn the call to Dexter Congbalay for any additional or closing remarks. Dexter Congbalay :  Thanks everyone for joining us this morning. Good afternoon up here in Europe. Nick and I will be around for the rest of the day to take any calls, or frankly for the rest of the week. But then again have a good day. Operator :  Thank you. That does conclude the Mondel\u0113z International third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

And welcome to the Mondel\u0113z International Fourth Quarter 2014 Year End Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is scheduled to last about one hour including remarks by Mondel\u0113z management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dexter Congbalay, Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondel\u0113z International. Please go ahead, sir. Dexter Congbalay : Good morning and thanks for joining us. With me are Irene Rosenfeld, our Chairman and CEO; and Brian Gladden, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our earnings release and today\u2019s slides, which are available on our website mondel\u0113zinternational.com. As you know, during this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Irene. Irene Rosenfeld : Thanks, Dexter, and good morning. In 2014 we delivered solid results, even as we faced headwinds in the broader environment. We have made good progress on our transformation agenda, especially in our supply chain and in overheads. Of course, we also announced our coffee joint venture, which we expect to close later this year. As we enter 2015, we will continue to focus on what we can control, reducing costs, pricing to protect profitability and driving Power Brands and innovation platforms in key markets. In addition, we are taking some specific actions to exit lower margin revenues to improve our mix. Overall, I am quite confident in our ability to execute our plans, achieve our strategic objectives and continue to deliver solid returns to our shareholders. Turning to the specifics for 2014, we generated strong earnings growth and margin expansion in a challenging environment by driving record net productivity and aggressively reducing overheads. On the topline, we delivered organic net revenue consistent with our latest outlook, as we raised prices to recover higher input costs and protect profitability, while continuing to invest in our growth platforms. Specifically, for the full year, organic net revenue was up 2.4%, adjusted operating income margin increased 80 basis points to 12.9%. That was in line with our guidance of about 13%, despite absorbing a 50 basis point headwind from the timing of mark-to-market accounting. Adjusted EPS was a $1.76 for the year, up 23% on a constant currency basis and the source of this growth was high quality, driven mostly by operating gains. In light of a still challenging macroeconomic environment, consumer confidence and spending weakened in many of our key markets, while competition among food retailers was intense, especially in Europe. We faced significantly higher prices for key commodities, like cocoa and coffee, and this inflation was magnified by local currency devaluation, especially late in the year. In response we quickly priced across our portfolio to offset the input cost inflation and to protect profitability. As a result, pricing was the key driver of our revenue, contributing 4.5 percentage points for the year. Looking more closely at the sources of growth last year, emerging markets were up 7% with Brazil, Russia and India all increasing double digits. Developed markets were down modestly. This reflected the temporary effects of pricing-related customer disputes in Europe that we talked about last quarter, as well as increased trade investments in North America. Let\u2019s take a more detailed look at full year topline results in each of our regions. Latin America grew 15%, driven by pricing gains, especially in the inflationary economies of Venezuela and Argentina. Brazil was up double digits, including solid growth in all of our categories. EMEA grew 6.5%, driven by higher pricing and modest growth in vol mix. Russia increased double digits. Vol mix continued to improve contributing more than a third of our growth there. I am very pleased with the performance of our team in Russia, who had consistently delivered strong results over the past couple of years. However, given the recent currency devaluation and deteriorating microeconomic situation, we expect growth and profitability in Russia to be somewhat more challenging in 2015. I'd also like to acknowledge our team in Ukraine, who delivered organic revenue that was essentially flat, despite operating in a most difficult environment. Continuing with our region performance, Asia-Pacific declined 2.8%, as higher pricing was more than offset by lower vol mix. China was down mid-single digits for the full year due to continued softness in biscuits, but we will be now beginning to see some signs of recovery. India delivered another year of double-digit growth, but industry-wide price increases in chocolate tempered category growth in the fourth quarter. In the near-term we expect this trend to continue until consumers adapt to the new pricing levels. North America was up nearly 1% for the year, reflecting slower growth in biscuits as the category softened, as well as increased competition in the fourth quarter, especially in crackers. We stepped up our brand and trade investments accordingly, and we're pleased to see signs of category recovery in the recent biscuit data. We expect growth to accelerate in early 2015. In Europe, organic revenue was down 1% for the year, while pricing was up nearly 1.5 points, vol mix fell, as a result of the number of factors, including lower category growth, as consumer demand softened in the weaker macroenvironment, pricing-related elasticity and pricing-related customer disruptions especially in France. Finally, in Europe, after more than a year of headwinds, coffee turned into a tailwind in the fourth quarter, contributing over 2 points of growth, as we price to offset higher green costs. Turning now to our categories. For the full year snacks grew just under 4% and our global categories grew about 3.5%. Importantly, growth rates soften somewhat in the back half and we anticipate this trend will continue in 2015. Biscuits remained the strongest of our snacks categories, up about 5% worldwide and while the reset of our China business, held our revenue growth below that of the total category, we made good progress on our biscuits portfolio. Oreo led the way. Globally it grew high single digits and exceeded $2.5 billion in sales, driven by new product innovations, such as Oreo Thins in China, as well as new package format, such as family size in the U.S. After its first full year in Brazil, Oreo has already achieved more than 2.5 share, while in Europe it continue to grow at a double-digit rate, up more than 25%. Like Oreo, our belVita breakfast biscuits platform also grew strongly, up nearly 30%, topping $650 million in global revenues. Innovation here also played a key role. Our new soft baked line drove over 50% growth for belVita in the U.S., while belVita Crunchy which we launched last spring in several European markets is off to a good start. In chocolate, the impact of higher prices to offset rising cocoa and dairy costs, and the effect of weakening emerging market currencies tempered global category growth to below 4%. As we\u2019ve discussed in prior earnings calls, our decision to increase prices globally, resulted in soft volume and share performance as some competitors either laid predominantly in emerging markets or did not priced at all as was the case in parts of Europe. We believe that all of our competitors will eventually raise prices, given that they're facing the same input cost pressures we are. Ultimately, as the price dislocation moderates, innovation is key to regaining momentum in the chocolate category and we've built solid platforms to accomplish that. For example, we continue to expand marvelous creations, our Chunky Chocolate filled with fun things like candy pieces and jellybeans, and we\u2019ve expanded that into new markets like Canada and Russia, driving incremental growth. We also recently launched Cadbury Glow, a new premium gifting chocolate brand in India, Singapore and Hong Kong, initial results have been strong, already reaching 13% of the Indian chocolate gifting segment last quarter. Finally, the gum and candy category grew about 2% for the year. Our revenue was down about 3% due to the implementation of a sugar tax in Mexico, where we have an 80 share, government restrictions on gum imports in Venezuela and the customer disputes in France. However, we grew or held share in four of our top six gum markets, including the U.S., Japan, Brazil and China, driven by improved price-pack architecture and a focus on freshness. China is now the second-largest gum market in the world and our growth continued to be robust, up nearly 50% last year, benefiting from the launch of Stride Bottles and Stride Layers. So, as you can see, we are taking the necessary steps to ensure the long-term health of our business. We are pricing to protect profitability and aggressively reducing costs, so that we can continue to invest in our franchises to drive sustainable top tier returns for our shareholders. With that, let me turn it over to Brian. Brian Gladden : Thanks, Irene. Good morning, everyone. Over the next few slides, starting with slide 7, I will walk you through our 2014 margin and EPS progress, as well as our outlook for 2015. Adjusted gross margin decreased 60 basis points to 36.8%, with 50 points of the decline attributable to the timing of the mark-to-market accounting for commodity and currency hedges. Over the course of the year, we successfully executed pricing of $1.6 billion. While this high level of pricing was enough to fully offset significant commodity and currency related cost inflation on a dollar basis, it wasn't enough to offset the impact of inflation on our margin percentage. We were able to essentially maintain gross margins, excluding the mark-to-market impact by delivering 2.8% net productivity, totaling more than $600 million. That\u2019s a record for the company and a testament to strong work delivered by our integrated supply-chain team. As Irene noted, our adjusted OI margin increased 80 basis points to 12.9%, in line with our guidance of approximately 13%. Excluding the 50 basis point mark-to-market impact, our underlying margin improvement was actually 130 basis points. Lower overheads drove more than half of this improvement, as we aggressively reduced expenses by leveraging zero-based budgeting and other cost-saving tools. In addition, we expanded margins by driving efficiencies in the non-working elements of our media spend, including significantly consolidating suppliers. We also reduced production costs as we shifted more advertising to digital outlets. To be clear, we maintained our working media support and increased our overall A&C spending on our Power Brands and innovation platforms. As we move to 2015, securing additional cost reductions will be a key focus and an important backstop to our plan. Looking at performance by region, you'll see that developed markets drove much of the margin expansion. In North America, adjusted OI margin increased to 140 basis points, despite absorbing the startup costs of our newest greenfield biscuit plant in Salinas, Mexico. We\u2019ll begin to realize the margin benefits from that plan, as we ramp up production later in the year. In Europe, adjusted OI margin expanded 170 basis points, as their overhead reduction and supply chain reinvention programs continues to pay dividends. Also worth mentioning is the impact of Latin America where margins grew 200 basis points. Our cost programs drove about half of this margin improvement, while the other half related to one-time items. Turning to earnings per share on slide 10, operating gains were the primary driver of our EPS growth. Adjusted EPS for the full year was a $1.76, up 23% on a constant currency basis. Operating gains, excluding mark-to-market accounted for $0.26 of this improvement. Our debt refinancing delivered $0.08 of EPS growth and our lower share count contributed another $0.08. Even after accounting for the $0.14 negative impact of currency translation, adjusted EPS was up more than 14% for the year. Cash flow has been another area of strong performance. Over the past two years, we delivered $4.8 billion of free cash flow excluding items. That\u2019s nearly 30% higher than our two-year guidance of $3.7 billion. Strong improvements in working capital has been the primary driver. We\u2019ve shortened our cash conversion cycle by 10 days, which comes on top of the 13-day improvement in the prior year. With our strong cash performance, we were able to return $2.9 billion in cash to shareholders last year. We repurchased $1.9 billion of shares, which is at the upper end of our $1 billion to $2 billion annual target. We also raised our dividend by 7%, with total payout of a $1 billion. Turning to slide 12, I\u2019m not going to cover this slide in detail but it\u2019s safe to say that the external operating environment continues to be challenging and volatile, whether it's slow GDP growth, weak consumer demand or a difficult retailer environment. And given our strong global footprint and uncontrollable variable, like the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, is especially challenging. Of course, there are a number of positive factors that will partially offset these headwinds both in 2015 and over the long-term, including the continuing trend towards increased snacking and on-the-go consumer dynamics. Within this challenging environment, we're focusing on what we can control and executing our transformation agenda. With respect to our portfolio as Irene mentioned, we continue to expect the coffee deal to close this year. On a much smaller scale, we anticipate closing and integrating our recent acquisition of the Kinh Do Snacks Business in Vietnam later this year. We are also working to improve our revenue mix by moving away from some low margin revenue. Specifically, we\u2019ve made deliberate decisions to exit non-strategic and margin diluted revenue, which will temper our organic revenue growth by about a 100 basis points this year. Examples of these decisions include exiting certain customers in Europe who have chosen not to accept our price increases, discontinuing certain low margin products that were sold under short-term trademark licenses from Kraft Foods Group and pruning some SKUs so we can simplify our supply chain and focus our investments on our growth platforms. 2015 is also a year of continued intense focus on costs in both our supply chain and overheads, as we progress towards our margin expansion goals. We will also continue to invest in our Power Brands and routes to market for future growth. We are excited by the longer-term prospects of accelerating growth, faster decision-making and cost savings, as we shift to a category led model in all of our regions. So, let\u2019s talk about how all this translates to our outlook for 2015. We expect organic revenue to grow at least 2%. As mentioned earlier, we see overall category growth rates remaining consistent with or even somewhat below 2014. That is, we anticipate our global categories will grow at least 3% in aggregate. In 2015, we expect to continue to prioritize margin improvements, which will impact our net revenue growth and market share. Now although it's not part of organic growth, I'd like to provide some perspective on the potential impact of foreign currency translation on our revenue. Based on January 30th spot rates, we estimate currency would be about 11% -- 11 percentage point headwind to our revenue growth. Obviously that\u2019s a big number but remember that 80% of our revenue is based in markets where the currencies are not tied to the strengthening U.S. dollar. So, while we anticipate our reported revenue will decline due to the significant currency translation impact, we expect to deliver solid organic growth in a challenging macroeconomic environment. Let me now turn to our margin outlook. In 2015, we expect to deliver adjusted OI margin of approximately 14%, another significant step towards our margin goal of 15% to 16% in 2016. The continued execution of both our supply chain reinvention and overhead reduction initiatives will be key drivers of the margin expansion. We expect the savings from these programs to build throughout the year. Moving onto EPS, we expect adjusted EPS to grow double-digits on a constant currency basis, which would be our third year in a row of double-digit EPS growth. Organic revenue growth and OI margin expansion will be the main drivers. In addition, we expect our adjusted interest expense to be about $825 million, given our current weighted average interest rate of about 4.5%, plus other financing costs. We expect our adjusted tax rate to be in the high-teens for 2015, slightly higher than the 16% we saw in 2014. And finally, we expect to repurchase between $1 billion and $2 billion of shares. Let me point out again that our EPS guidance is on a constant currency basis but since currency will be such a big headwind in our GAAP reported results at the end of the year, I\u2019d like to provide a bit of detail on that now. As I mentioned previously, 80% of our revenues is derived from currencies not tied to the U.S. dollar. This exposure to growth markets is typically a strength of our business model and I believe it will be over the long-term. However, most of these currencies have been devaluing versus the dollar over the last few months, resulting in a significant currency translation headwind. On slide 17, you can see the potential impact. We estimate adjusted EPS would be approximately $0.30 lower than our constant currency results based on January 30th spot rates. While we do business in many currencies, the lion\u2019s share of the headwind comes from the euro, the British pound, the Russian ruble and the Brazilian real. So to summarize our 2015 outlook, we expect organic net revenue to be at least 2%, including a 1-point headwind from our strategic decisions to exit low margin revenue. We anticipate adjusted OI margin of approximately 14% and double-digit growth in adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis. Please note that since we don\u2019t have a precise closing date for the coffee deal, our 2015 outlook includes the full year results for the coffee business. We will update our 2015 outlook for the impact of the coffee divestiture as we get more clarity on the closing date. So to wrap up, in 2014 we delivered strong earnings growth and margin expansion despite the challenging consumer and retail environment. While we expect the environment to remain difficult in 2015, we will continue to prioritize margin improvements while delivering modest revenue growth, focused on executing the cost reduction initiatives under our control and make the necessary foundational investments in our brands, innovation platforms, routes to market, and supply chain to stage the portfolio for the future. We remain confident in our ability to execute our transformation agenda so that we are well-positioned to deliver sustainable profitable growth and generate top-tier shareholder returns now and over the long term. With that, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Chris Growe of Stifel. Chris Growe : Hi. Thank you. Good morning. Irene Rosenfeld : Hi, Chris. Chris Growe : Hi. Just if I could ask two questions of you, Irene. First off would be, as you\u2019ve seen the softer growth in the developed markets, and particular in North America and Europe, does that have any -- is that having any effect on your margin outlook for those businesses? It looks like you\u2019ve got a pretty strong margin still built in here in '15, but does this slower growth rate have any effect on your future margin projections if I could ask that? Irene Rosenfeld : No, I actually think without a doubt, we are making some near-term prioritization in both of those geographies for margin. But I feel quite comfortable that with the guidance that we\u2019re giving to you that we made some reasonable expectations about where we expect the revenue to fall out. There is no question in Europe, in particular. We are experiencing some short-term headwinds as consumers and customers adapt to the new prices. I inspect that that will improve as the year progresses in both Europe and in North America. As I mentioned, we certainly are experiencing some category slowdown. We are taking a number of actions to improve that both in terms of marketing as well as some trade investments and we are starting to see the benefits of those investments. So net-net, I am quite confident that we will deliver the revenue that we need in both of those geographies consistent with the margin expectations that we set. Chris Growe : Okay. And just if I could ask one other question on ZBB and the implementation of that program. I am just curious if you can give us the kind of experience for 2014, and then perhaps the progress you\u2019ve made against overhead in particular with that program in '14? Brian Gladden : Yes, Chris, it\u2019s Brian. There was really the start-up this year of ZBB. But as you look at the overhead reductions, 90 basis point improvement year-over-year, it really was a big contributor. So a lot of focus on key categories of cost and indirect spending where we change policies, move to best practices that we learned in that process. And as we built the plans for 2015, we really did use the ZBB base process to build the operating plans. So I would say we are still in the early days. It will be a big contributor as we look at 2015 and into '16 using that tool. But good progress so far. Chris Growe : Okay. Thanks for the update. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Good morning, everybody. Two questions from me. First off, as we think about the margin cadence as we go through 2015, you said that it will be stronger in the back half. I am trying to get a sense of how the first half you expect it to play out. Do we see year-over-year margin improvement just at a slower pace in the first half? Or are there certain things that challenge margins in the first half that makes the two halves have to be even stronger to get to that about 14% for the full year? I am just trying to get a sense of how realistic that is and what is kind of built in, in terms of visibility? Brian Gladden : Yeah. I think the goals that we are providing for the full year, I would tell you as we look at some really critical drivers, supply chain improvements, the overhead reductions, even the pricing frankly, these were dynamics that will cause margins to accelerate through the year. Those benefits are more back-end loaded, just given the execution and as we work through for instance the start-up of the Mexico plant. That will drive benefits significantly higher in the second half than in the first half. So not getting into specifics around quarterly trajectory or margin targets by quarter, but it will be more back-end loaded. Andrew Lazar : Okay. And then you mentioned -- I think as you mentioned before 2015 is a year of sort of maximum change for the organization. You\u2019ve got the coffee JV implementing ZBB in a bigger way, the category led model in Europe, the ongoing issues around Western Europe and retailers and pricing and such. So I am trying to get a sense, '14 obviously shows a lot progress towards your two-year margin goal. And I am trying to get a sense of, are you giving -- is the organization giving itself enough cover, if you will, for certain things that are inevitably likely to go awry just during the course of the year with all these big changes that you\u2019ve got? Brian Gladden : Look I think we as a team spent a lot of time on building the plan as you point out. So, clearly some pieces moving around as you think about the year. But this is a reasonable plan that I think we worked hard to build confidence and backstops around this commitment. So there is clearly some pieces moving around, it\u2019s a relatively volatile environment. But as I said, there is things that we can control and we are working extra hard on those things to make sure we have offsets and backstops to allow us to deliver this commitment. Andrew Lazar : Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : Hey, good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask a follow-up I guess to Andrew\u2019s question. And it\u2019s just -- I guess if you go through assuming the 14% margin goal for '15, I guess two questions. One, in terms of FX effect on operating profit, the spread, there has been a bit of spread between the effect on revenues and operating profit. Should we expect that to continue in 2015? Brian Gladden : I think similar dynamics will continue to play out. As you think about transactional exposures, clearly we work hard through program -- through hedging programs as well as our efforts on pricing and cost reductions in the regions to drive consistency of execution there. It is a volatile environment. We have a hedge program, that\u2019s designed to provide some cushion to allow us to get prices in place, but we feel like that\u2019s what we have been doing and we will continue to execute that. Bryan Spillane : Okay. And just assuming that there are some modest spread if you kind of back into a current -- what the 14% margin implies, currency neutral. It\u2019s like a mid-teens currency neutral EBIT growth against a 2% organic sales growth. So I guess the question is just, in that bridge which is I guess roughly about $700 million of currency neutral profit growth, how much of it is hard savings versus things that might be variable depending upon -- I don\u2019t know mix or volume leverage or those types of things? Just trying to get a sense for how much of that margin target is really tied to some fixed savings versus things that might be variable. Brian Gladden : Yeah. Not really we are going to parse in detail. I would tell you that this is a supply chain reinvention, ZBB, overhead reduction driven plan. That\u2019s what you saw in 2014. And I think that\u2019s what you will continue to see in '15. Irene Rosenfeld : Yeah, I just want to build on that Brian. We are very focused on what we can control in this environment. And so we have high confidence that the commitments we are giving to you are some things that we have a clear line of sight to and we\u2019ve built our revenue. We think in a reasonable fashion given the realities of the market. And we got clear visibility to the programming that will drive the margin expansion. So net-net, it is a challenging environment. But we are very focused on making sure that we got in hand what we can control to drive our commitments. Bryan Spillane : Is the $500 million of annual COGS productivity that you outlined last year at CAGNY still part of the plan or is that changed? Brian Gladden : Well, that productivity in \u201814 was actually closer to 600. It was a record for the company at 2.8%. And I would tell you given all the activities around supply chain that will continue to accelerate. That's a big part of what we\u2019re focused on. Bryan Spillane : All right. That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from David Driscoll of Citi Research. David Driscoll : Great. Thank you and good morning. Brian Gladden : Hi David. Irene Rosenfeld : Good morning. David Driscoll : Irene, if Mondel\u0113z grew organic revenues 2.4% in 2014, can you just go back over why you would expect 3% net organic growth in \u201815? So I'm just looking at that chart and excluding the one point that you'll take out from things you want to discontinue, the underlying number is 3, and that's an acceleration over the 2.4%. But I think what everyone hears on this call is just how difficult these emerging markets are and even some difficulties in your developed markets, Europe, for instance. Why does it accelerate? Irene Rosenfeld : Well, if you think about it, David, we saw an acceleration even in the course of last year. We took pricing early in the year. As we shared with you, we led pricing in all of our categories. So the impact of that pricing plays out differently in each of the regions and differently over the course of time. And so the good news is in many of our emerging markets, we\u2019ve now seen those price gaps start to narrow. As I mentioned Europe remains particularly in chocolate, one of the regions, where those gaps are still bigger than we\u2019d like them to be. But the reason for the acceleration in the underlying growth is simply that as consumers adjust to these higher price points as our customers particularly in Europe reflect these higher price points, we expect that the market will be in -- move into more of a position of equilibrium. David Driscoll : And then, following up on your European chocolate questions, when we get our Nielsen data, the 12-week numbers show double-digit declines in Mondel\u0113z's European chocolate volumes. You mentioned a little bit of this in your prepared script, but can you talk more detail about what's going on right there? Why aren't these competitors following? And it's been going on now for, like, six months. So I'm a little concerned that you might be forced to retract your pricing, even through a list or a promotional event. Can you just talk about some of those issues and what you see happening in \u201815? Irene Rosenfeld : Again, it\u2019s a -- there\u2019s no question that our gap in Europe are wider than we\u2019d like them to be. As you believe, it\u2019s a question of timing. And so again we feel quite confident with the programming that we\u2019ve got. We\u2019re trying to see some good recovery to more of a normal state in a number of our key markets and we\u2019re going to stay the course. We\u2019ve got very strong brands and we believe that they have the pricing power. And we just need to take some time for the gaps to narrow a little bit and for the competition to catch up. But we are quite confident that given that their facing the very same cost headwinds that we are, that if the market will get back into more equilibrium in the foreseeable future. But again, it\u2019s one of the reasons that we\u2019re suggesting that our profile will improve as the year progresses. David Driscoll : Thank you for the color. I\u2019ll pass it along. Brian Gladden : Thanks David. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Goldman of JP Morgan. Brian Gladden : Hi. Ken Goldman : Thanks for the question. So you're guiding to double-digit EPS growth, ex-currency, which is where you usually guide, but still leaves a pretty wide range of possibilities. And when you talk about a 14% approximate EBIT margin, I mean, one of the questions I'm getting is, does that mean it could possibly range between 13.5% and 14.5%? So, if possible, even if just on a qualitative level, could you help narrow those ranges down a little bit, both in terms of, I guess, organic EPS and reported EBIT margin? Brian Gladden : Look, I think it\u2019s -- what you\u2019re suggesting is wider than we would expect. The reality is there is a volatile environment and we want to be a little bit careful and give ourselves a little bit of room here. But those are sort of the numbers that I think we meant to say, you can interpret them how you like. Ken Goldman : Okay. Irene Rosenfeld : But again, we know about what \u201814 looks like and we know what a double-digit growth rate is. So you can trust us that we\u2019re not kidding. Ken Goldman : No, I appreciate that. You can understand from our perspective, though, why it's just tougher to model. But I understand where you're coming from. And then, Brian, at last year's CAGNY, Dave said we should model about a 20% tax rate for the next three to five years, then mid-20s after that. I realize you're guiding to a high-teen tax rate for 2015. But just longer term, is that outlook in general still reasonable for us to use, in your view, as we look ahead? Brian Gladden : Yeah. Look I think over the mid-term, the next couple of years, 20% is a good number to the extent we\u2019re somewhat below that for \u201815. It\u2019s sort of acknowledging some expected discretes and some things that we know about it in 2015. But 20% is about the right rate for the next two to three years. Ken Goldman : And then you would agree that it maybe jumps up by a few percentage points after that? Brian Gladden : That\u2019s slightly right. Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t say jump probably creeps up after that. Ken Goldman : Okay. Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley. Matthew Grainger : Hi. Good morning everyone. Brian Gladden : Hi Matthew. Irene Rosenfeld : Hi Matthew. Matthew Grainger : Thanks. Brian, I guess first, one of the sources of cost savings in 2014 was a focus on ANC efficiency and reductions in non-working media. And just wondering, is this a source of savings that you would think can be a continued tailwind this year? And then in a broader sense, including working advertising, can you give us an idea of how you expect ANC to trend in 2015? Brian Gladden : Yeah. Because I think the team has done a really good job in managing the spend. We made some great progress in driving productivity in the spend around non-working, consolidating media accounts, reducing the spending and driving productivity and then moving more to digital. So all of these elements, I think gave us some flexibility to take the spend down a bit but also to continue to get value from the spend. We actually increased our spending on ANC around our Power Brands last year. And we\u2019re able to reduce spending in other parts that allowed us to actually get some good momentum there. So I think you\u2019ll see us continue to focus the spend in the right places. And as we see progress throughout the year, we\u2019d like to see that increase actually. So good progress in terms of getting productivity and allowing us to spend those dollars on real working media. Matthew Grainger : Okay. Great. Thanks, Brian. And Irene, could you elaborate a little bit on your comments earlier on the sales outlook in North America? You talked about trade programs you have in place and a reacceleration, and we've seen this start to become more visible in scanner data as well. So, is your optimism really a function of improved share trends in an environment that's still highly competitive and challenging or are you seeing a moderation in the competitive intensity within your categories overall? Irene Rosenfeld : Actually, our share performance has actually been quite strong and we expect that to continue. What actually is encouraging, we\u2019re starting to see the category recover a little bit. So we\u2019ve had an incredible run in North America, particularly on our biscuit business. We have been growing 4% to 5% well in excess of the category trends over the last couple of years. As we saw in the back half of last year, we started to see a slowdown and we\u2019re just basically going to continue to push the levers that have been so successful for us. We have the strong innovation plant. We\u2019re continuing to leverage our DSC muscle and we believe that that goes together. We started to see some recovery you\u2019re seeing it in the numbers as well. And we believe that that will continue into 2015. Matthew Grainger : Okay. Great. Thank you both. Operator : Your next question comes from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow : Hi. Thank you. I was hoping, like others on the call, to get a little more color on the behavior of your competition in Europe. Is most of your competition and share losses coming at the expense of multinationals who have not raised price yet in chocolate or is it local players who are staying low? And then especially in the U.K., you know, the U.K. numbers were really weak in fourth quarter. I thought some of it was tough comps from a year ago. But that struck me as the market where you really do have the most pricing power. And I want to know if there's anything you can say specifically about the U.K. being the same or different from the other European markets? Irene Rosenfeld : Yeah. I won\u2019t say the U.K. was different. We saw one of our competitors, Mars, in particular promoting quite aggressively. And I\u2019m pleased to say that we have responded to those actions and we\u2019re feeling comfortable that we\u2019re going to start to see a trajectory of change there. The reality is that a number of our multinational competitors have just lagged a little bit in their pricing response and that put some pressure on the business. But once again, it\u2019s one of the reasons we have protected our working ANC so carefully. It\u2019s one of the reasons we have really focused very much on looking market-by-market to ensure that we\u2019ve got the right programming and we have great confidence that we will start to see that trajectory improve. But again, it isn\u2019t necessarily going to happen overnight which is why we see the back half. It will build over the course of the year and the back half will be stronger. Robert Moskow : Irene, how are you determining which markets you want to respond to competitive activities and which you don't? It sounds like you responded to Mars in the U.K.; you responded to the biscuit competition in the U.S. What goes into that decision-making? Irene Rosenfeld : Well, a big focus is really which is the markets that matter most. And as we look at the world, we think about which are our key markets and our focus remains particularly, in a time when we want to make sure that our spending is having the greatest impact. We are focusing it disproportionately on our Power Brands and on those key markets that matter. And you\u2019ll see us do that in each of our core categories. Robert Moskow : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Alexia Howard of Bernstein. Alexia Howard : Good morning, everyone. Irene Rosenfeld : Hey, Alexia. Brian Gladden : Hey, Alexia. Alexia Howard : Okay. Can we focus in, to begin with, on SG&A cost savings? As I remember when you set out the original 300 basis points of margin improvement goal over three years, most of that was COGS. I thought about 250 basis points was COGS and the remaining 50 was SG&A. It seems as though you've gone a lot further along on the SG&A cost savings in 2014. Are those coming through better than expected? And what's the key driver of that? And then I have a follow-up. Brian Gladden : Yeah. I think when you look at cost reduction programs and ZBB as a methodology, overheads are easier to get out. They\u2019re quicker to realize benefits. And we\u2019ve done things like changing policies and tightening down controls on spending in key categories of spend. Those things are not depended on capital projects to improve the plan as you would have in COGS-focused effort. So that\u2019s really the driver. I think as you look at 2014, probably, slightly ahead of expectations from what we were driving on overheads. And I think there is more to do there. It\u2019s clearly going to continue to be a contributor to the margin improvement. And I think you\u2019ll see that in the 2015 results as well. Alexia Howard : Very helpful. Irene Rosenfeld : But I guess, it\u2019s just under 300 points. It was disproportionately in our developed markets. And I think you\u2019re seeing those -- that strong performance play through in the margin progression in 2014 that you see in North America and in Europe. So we\u2019re very much on track to deliver those targets that we laid out. Alexia Howard : Great. And then a quick follow-up. I know that the focus is not particularly on the top line at the moment but on innovation, where are you on new products as a percent of sales? Where do you expect that to get to over time? Has it come down in the last couple of years as your focus has played much more onto the margin front? Thank you. And I'll pass it on Irene Rosenfeld : Yeah. And the innovation is still the lifeblood of our business. We remained very focused on that Alexia. And it was about 13% -- it contributed about 13%, it was about 13% of our revenue. And we expect to see that we will continue to perform in that range, which we\u2019re quite comfortable with. It\u2019s one of the reasons that our Power Brands grew about 4% last year. And we\u2019re quite comfortable that we\u2019ve got a pipeline for 2015 that will basically drive the underlying growth that we\u2019ve laid out in our commitments. Alexia Howard : Thank you very much. I\u2019ll pass it on. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey, good morning, folks. Brian Gladden : Hey, Jason. Jason English : Thank you for taking the question. I guess I'll start on a topic that's been vetted a couple of times in the call and that's the European pricing environment, chocolate, price gaps, et cetera. I think I'm missing something here because I think about the cost structure for a European-based chocolate company. And I've got to be looking at cocoa prices that aren't really up very much; dairy prices that are down meaningfully; sweetener prices that are down meaningfully. All-in, from my vantage point, it looks like the COGS basket is actually deflationary. So what am I missing in that cost picture? Irene Rosenfeld : Well, Jason, if you look at the most recent cost, your point is correct. But if you look over the course of the year, there is no question these cost are all still up year-over-year and that\u2019s really what we\u2019ve been responding to. So the facts are that the market basket of inputs for our chocolate business are among the highest and they were a key part of our -- key reason for contributor to the $1.6 billion of pricing that we took this past year. So it is still a headwind for us. We are taking the necessary steps to start by protecting profitability and making sure that we are pricing to recover those costs. We\u2019re supporting our Power Brands in particular with the necessary spending to help to mitigate the impact and I\u2019m quite confident that as the market adapts to these new price points, both from an absolute elasticity standpoint, as well as from a price gap standpoint as competitors take pricing actions, I am quite confident that we\u2019ll see the market recover. Jason English : All right. So if spot prices hold, you probably don't see competitive price reaction in that environment? But what you lose on topline, you probably more than make up for on the bottomline, if the spot holds, Is that a fair characterization? Irene Rosenfeld : Well, I -- no, I would say that even with the recent deflation, there is still a net -- there\u2019s a need to catch up to some of the earlier cost increases and that\u2019s just undeniable. Jason English : Okay. Last question and I'll pass it on. Brian for you, I like the free cash flow chart you showed, but obviously it's a bit fictitious to pretend that we don't have the restructuring costs? I think if we look across restructuring this past year with both CapEx and cash from ops it was around $1 billion? So can you just give us the forward on how that cash leakage looks over the next two years and I think, based on the comments in the release, what you said before, most, if not all of that goes away in fiscal \u201917 and but can you just walk us through that detail? Brian Gladden : Yeah. Look, I think, what I would focus on is the underlying working capital progress is actually really good and we wanted to -- we want to talk about, that I will talk more about at CAGNY. I would say, 2015 will be the high year in terms of cash use for restructuring and CapEx related to the program. So in \u201916 it will begin to decline and then as you said, \u201917 it will be relatively small. So I think the underlying cash flow performance when you look at operating cash flow and free cash flow for the business, we\u2019re working hard to improve that and as this -- the cost related to the restructuring, as they go away, it\u2019s a pretty powerful cash flow story. Jason English : And I'm sorry if I missed this, did you give CapEx guidance for 2015 and if not, can you? Dexter Congbalay : We will talk about\u2026 Irene Rosenfeld : I think we\u2019ll provide that at CAGNY. Jason English : Okay. All right. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from John Bumgarner of Wells Fargo. John Bumgarner : Good morning. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to ask about the operating margins across your developing markets in totality, I think your initial longer term vision was to hold margins more or less steady overtime, then you had the step down in 2013 with the pressures in China and in Venezuela? You had some recovery this last year, but you're still about 200 basis points below 2012 level? So, I mean, how are you thinking about the ability to get back to that 2012 level, is it practical or is anything more structural changed in terms of reinvestment needs or the categories, just your thoughts there? Irene Rosenfeld : We still feel comfortable over the reasonable horizon, John, we will be able to get our emerging market margins up to peer levels. As you saw, we had a very strong year in LA. We\u2019re making progress in Europe. In EMEA, it doesn\u2019t show as well because of this tremendous impact at pricing had on our overall business and AP remains a place a little bit of a construction site for us as we see our China business recovering overtime. So we will see those margins improved, a lot of the focus of our ZBB activities are design to address overhead opportunities in those markets and they will also benefit from some of the supply chain work that we\u2019re doing particularly as we add more efficient lines with our capacity expansion. So we will see those margins come up in the very short-term, because the currency has been so volatile in those emerging markets. It\u2019s been a significant headwind in those geographies. John Bumgarner : And then, Irene, just to follow up, in terms of the dislocation in Russia and your plans for the, I guess, the new facility there, has that changed your plan at all or is that still the green light? Irene Rosenfeld : Well, as we told you, we are making an investment there. We are still investing in the shell, building in Siberia. And we\u2019ll continue to monitor that situation to make sure that our assets are appropriately protected. As I\u2019ve said on the call, I\u2019m quite pleased with the performance of our team. They have done a very good job even in the face of some of the sanctions. But certainly, as we think about making additional investments, we want to continue to keep our ear to the ground. John Bumgarner : Okay. Thank you, Irene. Operator : Your next question comes from Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank. Eric Katzman : Hi. Good morning. Brian Gladden : Hey, Eric. Eric Katzman : I guess a couple of questions, if I could. Brian, I'm a little confused. So you've got roughly -- included in dollar terms, let's call it flattish earnings per share. Your sales are going to be down, if the forecast is correct, about 9%. Your tax rate is a headwind. So you're obviously implying pretty strong margins. Is the -- operating margin -- is the 14%, does that include or exclude currency? Brian Gladden : It includes currency x%. Eric Katzman : Yes. But you're including currency, that's like a -- okay. And then kind of more, I guess -- I was just really surprised, like Latin America margins at 20% in the quarter, EU margins at very high levels. I think you mentioned there was a one-time benefit to LatAm. But maybe you could explain a little bit more as to why those margins were just so high, given challenging fundamentals and I assume some currency headwinds even in the quarter. Brian Gladden : Yeah. I think specifically for LatAm, we talked about it. About half of the improvements driven by costs, cost actions and the other half is a one-time benefit related to VAT accruals in the region that contributed about 20 basis points in the fourth quarter. But the reality is there is underlying improvement in cost structure, the pricing is working. We are improving margins. Eric Katzman : Okay. Any commentary on the European margins being so high? Irene Rosenfeld : No. I mean, again, as we\u2019ve said, as we think about our margin opportunity as an enterprise, the two biggest opportunities lay in our developed markets. And I\u2019m very pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve made in Europe on basically all aspects of the P&L. So, I think we are well positioned. Brian Gladden : Yes. It\u2019s driven by improvements in lower SG&A and better gross margins, so it\u2019s the right things. Yeah. Eric Katzman : Okay. And then -- thank you for that. And then -- just kind of thinking like, at least in the fourth quarter, right, volume mix was down in every segment. And your market share, although this is an annual number, you lost market share in a majority of the business. I'm looking on slide 6. I mean that's in dollar terms. That\u2019s in dollar terms. But I guess I'm not really sure how to judge, Irene, kind of organic topline performance. Price is now such a function of trying to offset the currency devaluations. If I look at vol/mix, it's down. Your share is down and your A&P budget is being cut. So kind of how do I think about that? I thought the goal was to gain share even with the categories struggling. Irene Rosenfeld : So, let me take those in a couple of pieces, Eric. There is no question that our long-term algorithm assumes a balanced, a volume, mix and pricing. And in the short-term, there is no question that we\u2019re leaning disproportionately on pricing given the enormous increases that we are seeing in both our commodity increases, as well as in the impact of the currency devaluation. So it was about 4.5 points of our 2.4 points of revenue growth. So it was a significant impact, which says vol/mix was a negative and there is no question. As I\u2019ve talked about couple of times on the call that in the short-term, the $1.6 billion of pricing that we took has had an impact in the marketplace. We are monitoring that very carefully. We are thoughtful about which market and which categories we are monitoring and protecting. And the end in mind is to get our ourselves back on to a trajectory over the long-term where we grow at or above the rates of our category growth. But in the near-term, the single biggest opportunity for us to ensure that we had adequate money to invest in our franchises is to make sure that we\u2019re pricing to protect our margins in the face of escalating cost. So there is nothing about the numbers that\u2019s inconsistent with the approach that we are taking. Over the long-term, we would expect to see our business is growing at or above the rates of our categories. But in the near-term, while costs are as volatile as they are, we want to make sure that we are protecting our profitability and that has a short-term dislocation impact. Eric Katzman : Okay. Thanks for that. I'll pass it on. Dexter Congbalay : Hey, Eric. Regarding -- it\u2019s Dexter, sorry. Regarding A&C, you said that we\u2019re cutting A&C. I think Brian mentioned a few minutes ago, we actually increased our spending on our Power Brands. And the reduction in our A&C from a percentage standpoint is largely driven through gaining efficiencies and shifting a little bit more towards digital. So I don\u2019t know what you were listening to earlier, but that\u2019s what Brain said a few minutes ago. Eric Katzman : Well, I understand that, but I guess as obviously a very brand-oriented company long-term, advertising and promotion as a percentage of your -- or A&C as a percentage of sales, historically that's been a very good measure of brand equity and brand health. You didn't even mention it anywhere. I mean, there's no comment as to what A&C spending is in the press release\u2026 Dexter Congbalay : Eric, it was down a little bit on a percentage of revenue. We increased our spending on our Power Brands. Okay. Eric Katzman : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : We have time for one more question. Your final question comes from David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets. David Palmer : Thank you. Good morning. Just a quick one on coffee. You said that's included in your 2% organic growth. Does it feel like coffee will be less of a drag, and perhaps significantly so this year than in 2014? Irene Rosenfeld : Simple answer is yes. I think as you just saw in the fourth quarter, it contributed about 2 points to our overall growth. We had a strong fourth quarter. We are well staged for this year as we set up the JV. And as we said, we are confident that the deal will close sometime this year. David Palmer : And then second, just if you were to summarize the emerging market demand expectations, excluding currency, how do you expect overall revenue and profit trends in the emerging markets to compare to 2014? I asked partly because you've highlighted some cross-currents, like Russia perhaps getting worse and China perhaps getting better. Thanks. Irene Rosenfeld : No, I mean emerging markets continue to be an important source of our growth. So we expect to see some recovery, as again as the markets adjust to the pricing levels, as we close our price gaps, and as we continue to invest in the franchises. So we have great hopes for our emerging markets in aggregate. I did call out Russia because I would suggest given the events there we would expect to see a somewhat different trend there next year in 2015 than we had last year. But long-term, we continue to feel quite bullish about Russia and the rest of our emerging markets. But, I mean, if you look at our performance in India and Brazil and China is starting to come back, they will be a critical piece of our performance in 2015. David Palmer : Thank you. Dexter Congbalay : Thanks, David. Operator : This concludes the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s conference. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks. Dexter Congbalay : Hi, it\u2019s Dexter. Thanks for everybody for joining the call. Nick and I will be available for the rest of the day and over the course of the next week. We\u2019ll see everybody at CAGNY. Just so everybody knows we\u2019ll be presenting at 12 :30 on Tuesday -- 12:30 Eastern Time. And we hope to see everybody there. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Please disconnect your lines at this time. And have a wonderful day.",

Welcome to the Mondelez International First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last for about an hour, including remarks by Mondelez management and a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dexter Congbalay, Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondelez International. Please go ahead, sir. Dexter Congbalay : Good morning. Thanks for joining us. With me are Irene Rosenfeld, our Chairman and CEO; and Brian Gladden, our CFO. Earlier today we sent out our earnings release in today's slides which are available on our website, MondelezInternational.com. As you know, during this call we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our form 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on forward-looking statements. Some of today's prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Irene. Irene Rosenfeld : Thank you, Dexter. Good morning. As you know, 2015 is a year of big change for us and we're off to a solid start. We've continued to make good progress in a challenging environment by focusing on what we can control. This includes executing our transformation agenda, prioritizing margin expansion, and strong constant currency earnings growth while delivering solid revenue growth. Specifically, organic net revenue grew 3.8% driven by pricing actions to recover currency driven input cost increases. We significantly expanded adjusted operating income margins, up 160 basis points to 13.8%. Importantly, adjusted gross margin contributed more than half of the increase while lower overheads contributed the rest. Adjusted EPS was $0.41 up nearly 26% on a constant currency basis, driven almost entirely by operating gains. As we discussed at CAGNY, we're executing three transformation priorities that will further leverage our advantage portfolio and geographic footprint while setting us up to deliver top-tier financial performance as global demand improves. Let me give you a quick update on each of our transformation initiatives. To further focus our portfolio on snacks, to reduce our supply chain and overhead costs, and to continue investing for growth. On the portfolio front, we expect our Jacobs Douwe Egberts coffee joint venture to close this year, likely in the third quarter. We're working to secure the necessary regulatory approvals from the European commission and are awaiting the results of the Phase II review. We anticipate closing our acquisition of Kinh Do\u2019s Biscuit business in Vietnam around mid-year and are looking forward to leveraging the growth opportunities of this attractive business. With about $175 million in sales, Kinh Do is one of the largest snack companies in Vietnam with iconic brands and leading positions in biscuits and moon cakes. Going forward we intend to accelerate its growth by introducing our power brands into its distribution network which covers 130,000 outlets. We also welcomed Enjoy Life Foods into our family last quarter. While starting from a relatively small revenue base, the company provides us with an excellent platform for future growth. We're very excited about the opportunity to leverage its strong brands and market position in fast-growing, better for you allergen-free snacks. Turning to our cost reduction programs, we're continuing to make good progress across our supply chain and in overheads. Net productivity in the quarter was very strong at more than 3.0% of cost of goods sold, building on the record rate of 2.8% we delivered last year. These productivity gains were instrumental in driving our 90 basis points improvement in adjusted gross margin. We're complementing the supply chain savings by aggressively managing overheads, leveraging the zero-base budgeting process we began about 18 months ago. This includes reducing indirect expenses, as well as streamlining infrastructure and internal processes. In fact, we've already begun to migrate some transactional processes to our new global shared service centers. As a result, we continue to reduce overheads as a percent of revenue. Of course these savings not only enable us to expand margins, but they also provide the fuel for investing in growth. As we highlighted at CAGNY, this includes investing in new advantaged assets as part of our supply chain reinvention. For example, our biscuit plant in Salinas, Mexico opened on schedule in the fourth quarter. By the end of the first half, we'll have five new lines up and running to support growth, and repatriate volume is currently co-manufactured. As you'll recall, each of these new lines gives us 1000-point margin increase over existing assets. We're also bringing on stream advantaged lines of the future at other facilities around the world. In emerging markets like India and China, as well as in Europe and the U.S. Each of these state-of-the-art lines has operating costs that are about half as much as our current lines, and runs twice as fast while taking up only a fraction of the floor space. We've also continue to invest in working media to strengthen our brand equities, backstop our pricing, and support innovation. Total advertising and consumer spending was essentially flat on a constant currency basis as we maintained marketing support particularly on our power brands. That said, as a percent of revenue A&C was down slightly as we continued to drive efficiencies in nonworking media, move more advertising to lower cost digital channels, and shifted the timing of certain marketing programs. For the remainder of the year, we expect A&C to rise modestly as we invest behind new product launches and marketing programs to drive revenue and improve share. Let's take a more detailed look at our top line results for the quarter. As you can see on slide five, organic net revenue grew 3.8% with pricing contributing 6.5 percentage points. Consistent with our strategy we've raised prices to recover higher input costs, including the impact of currency. As we've discussed previously, this protects profits and enables us to continue to invest in our people and in our key growth drivers, our brands, innovation platforms, sales and distribution capabilities, and supply chain. It's important to note that in the first quarter a significant contributor to the increase in price was the carryover benefit of pricing actions taken last year. Of course, rising prices especially when the increases are significant typically have a short-term impact on consumer demand. In Q1, vol/mix was down 2.7 percentage points due in part to elasticity. As we discussed in our earnings call last quarter, we're also experiencing the impact of some strategic decisions to improve revenue mix. These include discontinuing some low-margin customer specific product lines especially in Europe, exiting low-margin products associated with short-term brand licenses from Kraft Foods, and ongoing SKU simplification. In the quarter, these strategic decisions accounted for about 140 basis points of the decline in vol/mix. For the full-year, we expect these decisions to be about 100 basis point headwind to our organic growth, and as we've said before, this has been incorporated into our revenue guidance. Partially offsetting this headwind in Q1 is about a 50 basis points benefit from a shift of Easter-elated shipments into the first quarter. Our power brands, which represent about two-thirds of our revenue, grew nearly 6% led by OREO, chock, Club Social, and belVita biscuits, Lacta chocolate, Trident gum, Halls candy, Jacobs, Carte Noir, and Tassimo coffee. Emerging markets were up nearly 11% with the BRIC countries up double digits. Developed markets were down 0.5%. Turning now to our results by region, as you can see on slide six, Latin America and EMEA fueled by higher pricing drove much of our overall growth. Latin America was up nearly 19% driven by the inflationary economies in Venezuela and Argentina. Brazil was up nearly 10% including a meaningful contribution from vol/mix and solid growth across all categories. EMEA grew 11% primarily due to pricing in Russia and Ukraine in response to the sharp devaluation of those currencies. Despite this, vol/mix was up in both countries and share performance was solid. Russia grew mid-teens with strong growth in our two largest categories. Chocolate was up high-teens behind Alpen Gold and coffee was up over 20%. Asia-Pacific grew modestly with solid gains in China and India. China was up high single-digits driven by strong performance of both OREO and Stride gum. We continue to be encouraged by our progress, this is the third consecutive quarter of high single-digit growth there. Our team is executing well, and we're selectively investing to continue and hopefully accelerate our momentum. India was up mid-single digits as Cadbury Dairy Milk share topped 40% its highest ever. However, chocolate price increases tempered consumer demand. We expect category and revenue growth in India to improve as the year progresses, not only as we increase A&C investments but also as consumers adjust to the industry-wide price increases implanted last year. North America revenue declined modestly largely due to a change in a large customer's in-store strategy the reduced merchandising and display opportunities. Although this led to a decline in the overall biscuits category and a modest decrease in our revenue, we grew our share driven by strength in crackers. To accelerate revenue and category growth for the remainder of the year we're stepping up marketing support behind our power brands and innovation platforms, as well as increasing investments behind in-store execution. Finally Europe was down 0.6% in line with our expectations. Frankly, we expect Europe's first half to be soft as the macro environment continues to be challenging. In addition, the strategic decisions to improve revenue mix that I mentioned earlier, tempered Europe's volumes by about 200 basis points which was only partially offset by 60 point benefit due to the Easter shift. We've continued to experience some negative volume elasticity as a result of our decision to lead pricing higher input cost especially in chocolate. However, we expect this pressure to ease in the back half. Turning now to our categories, for the quarter snacks categories grew about 4.5% globally up from the low three's as we exited last year. Of course, the Easter shift helped boost growth rate somewhat including beverages cheese in grocery our categories edged closer to 5% growth. Along with overall category growth modestly improving, our share performance began to stabilize with 48% of our snacks revenues gaining or holding share in the quarter. That's up from 40% in 2014. In addition, compared to the softening trends we saw in the back half of last year, our share performance improved across almost all of our snacks categories. The biscuits category grew about 4% down from 5% last year, much of this slower growth came in North America and Europe. Our biscuits revenue grew in line with the category as we gained or held share in key markets fueled by our power brands which grew high single-digits. For example, OREO was up mid-teens driven by innovation in China and distribution gains in Brazil and Europe. Top Club Social grew more than 30% with launches of new flavors and pack sizes in Brazil. BelVita was up high single digits with strong growth in the U.S. behind the continued success of the BelVita Bites and in the U.K. with the belVita Tartine and crunchy. Turning to chocolate, the category grew 6.5%, aided by the Easter shift. Our sales only increased slightly more than 1.0% with only about 35% of our revenue gaining or holding share. The softness was due primarily to our European business which accounts for half of our global chocolate sales. We expected this knowing that a significant portion of the decline would be due to our decision to discontinue some low-margin product lines, and that we'd continue to experience some volume elasticity and share losses because we led pricing. Although we expect continued share pressure in Q2, we're encouraged to see that most of our European competitors have now begun to raise prices. As a result we expect our shares to strengthen in the back half of the year. In the meantime, we're selectively stepping up our marketing and promotional activity to narrow price gaps and regain share. In emerging markets, increase mid-single-digits and we gained or held share in our key markets. For example, in Brazil our largest Chocolate business in emerging markets, sales grew high single-digits and we increased share by about a point. In India, our second-largest emerging markets Chocolate business, although the category slowed, revenue was up mid single-digits and we held share. And in Russia and South Africa, revenue was up mid to high-teens, holding share as well. Looking ahead, as price gaps narrow and we increased marketing support in the back half of the year, we expect global chocolate revenue growth in both developed and emerging markets to accelerate and our shares to rebound. Turning to gum and candy, the category grew about 1.5% while our revenue was up nearly 6%. For the first time in a while, I'm pleased to see strong gum growth. Like chocolate our gum results are a tale of two cities. Developed markets continued to be down mid-single digits with share losses in France, Japan, and the U.S. But in emerging markets, gum was up mid-teens led by strong revenue and share performance in Brazil and China. To summarize we're very pleased with our performance in the first quarter. We delivered solid revenue growth in a challenging environment and made good progress in stabilizing our shares. We're executing our transformation agenda well, including aggressively reducing cost to expand margins and to provide the fuel to invest in our franchises to drive sustainable revenue and earnings growth. With that, let me turn it over to Brian. Brian Gladden : Thanks, Irene. Good morning, everyone. Building on what Irene just said, we're feeling confident about our execution especially the strong progress we're making to drive down costs, expand margins, and grow earnings per share. Starting with slide eight, you can see that adjusted gross margin increased 90 basis points to 38%. Pricing, including the carryover benefit of actions taken in 2014, more than offset the increase in commodity and currency related cost inflation this allowed strong productivity of more than 3% of COGS or about $175 million to fall through. Adjusted OI margin was up 160 basis points to 13.8%. Adjusted gross margin expansion accounted for more than half of the increase, the rest was driven by lower overheads as we continued to aggressively reduce expenses by leveraging our zero-base budgeting approach and other cost saving tools. Looking at margin performance by region, you can see that North America, Europe, and Latin America drove our adjusted OI expansion. North America was up 400 basis points, more than half of this improvement was driven by strong net productivity with the remainder largely due to lower overheads. Europe was up 180 basis points as strong net productivity positively impacted adjusted gross margins. Latin America increased 120 basis points predominantly driven by overhead leverage. In contrast EMEA declined 240 basis points. The sudden and severe devaluation of Ukrainian and Russian currencies made it difficult to fully recover input cost inflation in the near-term without sacrificing volume declines or share losses. As we exit the quarter, we're in a much better position with margins in these markets. We expect margin will improve as the year progresses as we continue to implement additional price increases to cover higher costs. In Asia-Pacific, margin was down 30 basis points, while we improved gross margin and lowered overheads, the phase out of the local tax incentive program offset underlying year-over-year operating margin improvement. Turning to EPS on slide ten, adjusted EPS for the first quarter was $0.41 up nearly 26% on a constant currency basis. The year-over-year improvement in our operating income accounted for $0.09 of this increase. Below the operating line, lower interest expense from our successful debt refinancing added $0.01 and lower outstanding shares add another $0.02. Also below the line our effective tax rate was higher, driven mostly by the geographic mix of where our earnings were generated. The higher tax rate hurt our EPS by $0.02 versus last year. Even after accounting for the $0.08 negative impact of currency translation, adjusted EPS was up more than 5%. On the next page, you'll see that we returned $1.75 billion of capital to our shareholders in the first quarter. We purchased $1.5 billion of stock that represented 41.7 million shares and an average price of just under $36 as we frontloaded most of our buyback activity given the relatively attractive share price and our liquidity. Consistent with our outlook, we expect to buy back up to $2 billion of stock for the year. However, this doesn't include additional share repurchase activity related to the expected cash proceeds from a coffee deal in the second half. We also paid about $250 million in dividends. As we previously stated, we intend to pay a modest dividend with shareholder returns largely driven by EPS growth. Nonetheless, we're committed to maintaining a payout ratio of at least 30%. Today our payout ratio is about 35%. Turning to slide 12, in the first quarter we took advantage of an opportunity to refinance some of our higher cost dollar debt into lower coupon, euro, Sterling, and Swiss franc denominated notes. The weighted average rate for the $2.5 billion of U.S. dollar notes we tendered was about 6.2%. We financed the tender by issuing the equivalent of about $3.5 billion of notes at very attractive rates securing a weighted average coupon of 1.9%. As a result we lowered the weighted average cost of our long-term debt by about 100 basis points to 3.6%. We also extended the average tenure of our long-term debt by nearly a year from about 7.5 years to 8.5 years. For 2015, this lowers our total interest expense by $75 million to $100 million depending upon how currency rates evolve for the year. Now turning to our outlook for the year. Given our solid start, we're increasingly confident in our ability to deliver our 2015 outlook. With that said, we still have much to do as we execute our transformation. So in the near term, we want to be prudent and we are substantially reaffirming our outlook for the year. We continue to expect organic revenue to grow at least 2% including a headwind of about 100 basis points from the strategic decisions to improve revenue mix that we discussed earlier. We anticipate adjusted OI margin of approximately 14% and double-digit growth in adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis. And we expect free cash flow excluding items to be approximately $1.2 billion. While our overall guidance for constant currency adjusted EPS has not changed, the makeup of the below the line items will be somewhat different. Due to our debt refinancing our interest expense is likely to be around $750 million rather than the original guidance around $825 million. In addition, due to earnings mix and consistent with what we saw in the first quarter, our effective tax rate is likely to be higher than we originally anticipated. Instead of an estimated tax rate in the high-teens, we currently expect a rate in the low-20s. Of course, currency continues to be a significant and increasing headwind this year given that 80% of our revenue is not tied to the U.S. dollar. Using April 27 spot rates, we anticipate the currency headwind would be about 12 percentage points for revenue versus our earlier estimate of 11 points. We also anticipate a $0.33 impact to adjusted EPS compared to our initial $0.30 estimate. While the currency impact is significant, we believe our underlying performance and operations are solid. We remain confident in our ability to deliver strong constant currency earnings growth and solid organic revenue growth this year. One last point, since we don't have the necessary regulatory approvals to know the precise closing date for the coffee JV, our 2015 outlook includes the full-year results for the Coffee business. Assuming a closing sometime in the third quarter, we'll likely update our 2015 outlook for the impact of the coffee transaction when we report our second quarter results. So to wrap up, we've had a solid start to the year by focusing on what we can control as we prioritize margin expansion and strong constant currency earnings growth, while delivering solid revenue growth. We're making good progress on our transformation agenda. Our initiatives to focus our portfolio on track including the coffee JV, we're executing well against our cost reduction programs, and we're continuing to invest in our power brands, our supply chain sales, and distribution capabilities to drive sustainable revenue and earnings growth over the long-term. As we anticipated our market share performance has begun to stabilize we expect it improve the second half as price gaps narrow and we continues to selectively increased marketing support and promotional programs. All of these actions have as well positioned to achieve our 2015 outlook and our 15% to 16% margin target for 2016. With that, let's open it up for questions. Operator : Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Two questions if I could. First, Irene, you mentioned most European competitors have now started to take pricing and follow some of your moves and that's a new development and clearly positive one. But you also mentioned I guess promotional spend, it will be needed to narrow price gaps. I'm trying to get a sense of whether the pricing that others have taken are not enough to get the gaps still where you want? Or if it's one player in particular that maybe hasn't yet moved, I'm trying to just connect those two dots. Irene Rosenfeld : The way it works is first of all, we've now seen most of our competitors announce as I mentioned but till it plays through, it takes some time. And in fact, it's one of the reasons I said we would still expect to see share softness in the second quarter. It'll take probably till the back half. In selected markets we want to continue to make sure that we're protecting our market position. So we've been very disciplined in looking market by market and seeing where we stand, and on that basis we're making that decision. But I feel quite confident that we will see our chocolate shares rebound in the back half of the year. Andrew Lazar : Brian, initially, I knew you expected margins to get sequentially better as the year progressed, they obviously expanded quite a bit more in the first quarter than even the full-year target would suggest. Where was the primary source of that upside in the quarter to margins? And do you expect the expansion therefore, to be less pronounced in future quarters on a year over year basis? And if so, why would that be? Brian Gladden : Yes, Andrew. I think we did see for probably the first time in a while, pricing is in a good position to cover inflation that we've seen driven by commodities and currency, which allowed net productivity to really drop through. I think that's the big one. As I mentioned in my comments, I think we were a bit ahead in terms of executing in a couple areas. One is supply chain and some of the reinvention activities helped contribute to that productivity. I think some of that is timing and executing a bit earlier, which helps, and then on overheads. We slightly beat our targets for overhead reductions, and that's really as ZBB is playing out, and our visibility and transparency to spending, and moving the culture to more cost-conscious culture I think is paying dividends for us. So those are the things I think that give us a little bit of tailwind in the quarter. And again as we talked about, I think the supply chain reinvention is clearly a second half impact that we still expect to see. We may be pulled a little bit of that into the first part of the year, which is great but there will be more to come in the second half. Andrew Lazar : So nothing necessarily one-off that we should expect starts to take down the rate of margin improvement necessarily as we move through the year, even though you're only looking for 100 basis points on a full-year basis of margin improvement? Because you start off the year quite a bit stronger than that? Brian Gladden : I would just say the first quarter, 13.8 in the first quarter is a pretty solid number, not a lot of one-off items that contributed to that number were hurt in the quarter. It's a pretty clean quarter. Andrew Lazar : Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer, with RBC Capital Markets. David Palmer : Good morning. A couple questions. First on gross margins, do you foresee 2015 as being a year of sequentially improving gross margin trend as you get new production up and running like the one you talked about at CAGNY in Mexico? And perhaps as you get the pricing in place and past some of these initial transactions effects, you talked about, for instance, in Russia, any color on sequential gross margin trends would be helpful. Brian Gladden : Yeah, David, I think it's more of a first half/second half dynamic as we talked about the supply chain. I think there's clearly some markets where there continues to be volatility and some areas were going to have to continue to work pricing to offset mostly currency-driven pressures. So it's a dynamic environment. We clearly looked at the second half as being more advantaged given the supply chain dynamic and we feel good about the start. Without getting into quarter-by-quarter trend I think this is a bit of a first half/second story for us. Irene Rosenfeld : But I would say, David, I do think you can see the algorithm start to play through and that's why we feel quite pleased with the quarter. The facts are that we're covering our cost increases through pricing as best we can. That's starting to play through and that's allowing our productivity to drop and you should see that dynamic continue to play through for the balance of the year. David Palmer : Just to follow up on your comment about reinvesting and ANC. I know you don't want to share too much with your competition, but where have you've seen the best ROI on spend? Where should we generally think about you spending that money? Thanks. Irene Rosenfeld : Well, what I'll tell you is we will be spending it where we get the best ROI and where we have capacity so I wouldn't know. There's certainly a number of our power brands like Oreo and belVita \u2013 we've got strong capacity coming in the back half and you'll see us spend behind those businesses. In the near-term though, I would say in a number of our markets I'm particularly pleased with the performance in EMEA, where we had to price quite aggressively in response to the rapid devaluation, and those are some of the markets where we were able to continue to make our ANC investments which than helped to protect our share. So I think as you see our aggregate share performance around the world, much of that was due to the fact that we continue to spend and in some cases increased our spending behind franchises. But net-net, we will be spending where we get the best return of where we have good capacity support. David Palmer : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Spillane of Bank of America. Brian Spillane : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Brian Gladden : Hi, Brian. Brian Spillane : Just one question just to understand a little bit about what's happened on the gross margin line this quarter, and I guess to try to bridge the balance of the year. If I did this analysis or calculation right, you got about $560 million benefit from pricing on gross margin and $175 million of net productivity gains, you did a $435 million currency headwind just translation, so is the gap there \u2013 assuming that your pricing covers your commodity costs \u2013 is the gap there in terms of the drag the transaction effect on gross margin? Brian Gladden : The numbers we would talk but would include the transaction impact of currency not translation. That said, the transaction impact is the pressure we're seeing mostly in the COGS line. Commodities are still up year-over-year in the quarter although they've been slightly down in the short-term so that is also a headwind. And when you think about the pricing that Irene talked about offsetting; it's really offsetting that transaction impact on our commodity prices and labor costs and other elements of the P&L. Brian Spillane : I guess what I was trying to get at was as we look at gross margins going forward and assuming that there is not any incremental pricing or maybe even a little bit of promotional activity just how does the currency \u2013 how should we think about the currencies will affect gross margin over the balance of the year? Is it potentially more of a drag because currencies are a little bit more averse? Or is it more neutralized going forward because you've taken some pricing in some of the markets where the currency has moved a lot? Brian Gladden : I think that becomes a market-by-market conversation. It's obviously our intent to use pricing to keep our margins whole as we see currency move around. So as currency stabilized over the last couple of months here a bit, we've caught up. And I think that's one of the contributing factors in the quarter. I think we just have to watch it quarter-by-quarter. There's some markets where we're still having to price, given that currencies have moved recently or we're still playing catch-up given how we can price in those markets. So I can't really answer the question on a global basis, I think it's market-by-market and I think we're in a reasonable spot in terms of covering currency right now. The ones I highlighted : Ukraine and Russia are places where it's taking time to get that through given the magnitude and the suddenness of those currency moves. Brian Spillane : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Chris Growe : Hi. Good morning. Irene Rosenfeld : Hey, Chris. Chris Growe : I had a question for you if I could first on North America. It was a very strong margin performance in North America, obviously a little softer revenue growth. I just want to get a sense of how the new plant would be contributing to that. Is that a major contributor in the quarter? It's a little sooner than I expected, but certainly nice improvement in the quarter. Irene Rosenfeld : No, actually it's not a contributor yet. As we keep talking about the fact that supply chain reinvention will have more of a back half impact, that Salinas is one of the prime examples of that. The team has done an excellent job of cost control and particularly overhead management, and that was the key contributor to the very strong margin performance. As we're starting up the plant, we're expensing those startup costs with a lot of volume, without up a lot of leverage in this plant. It's actually a drag in the first half of the year and that's part of why we expect improvement in the second half. Chris Growe : Okay. That's good color. Thank you. I have a general question on the emerging markets. You've had a much stronger performance this quarter than many of your competitors and your peers, even in light of macroeconomic challenges. I'm just curious, is it your categories that are performing well? Is it your own internal performance? Just any color you can give on the stronger performance there, given in light of the challenges in those markets. Irene Rosenfeld : We're very pleased with the performance in our emerging markets particularly given the significant inflationary pressures. I think our team has executed well both in terms of jumping on the pricing opportunity, managing that through very smart price architecture, as well as managing the cost line quite actively so that we can continue to invest behind the franchises. There's no question though, as was we look at markets like Russia and Brazil for example, and you see the GDP trends, we're cautious about that. We've got our eyes very carefully focused on inventory levels, making sure sell-in and sell-out are perfectly balanced. But there's no question that our teams have done an excellent job in this first quarter in managing our business in the face of quite a number of challenges in those markets. Chris Growe : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Ken Goldman : Good morning, everyone. Irene, you talked about a big retailer, I assume Wal-Mart offering fewer opportunities for displays and promotions, and I appreciate this retailer has talked about doing this across the board. But do you think and maybe, maybe not, the cookie and cracker categories were hit by disproportionate amounts? I'm curious if you see risk of further promo de-loading down the road or is this more of a one-time shift? Irene Rosenfeld : I think it was a near-term shift, Ken. And I think as you look at the impact that some of those decisions had on categories it, had a pronounced impact on the category and I do think that the opportunity to revisit some of those decisions and particularly in our categories which are highly impulse driven. We're big traffic generator and we contribute to overall growth. I do think that our teams are working through what the appropriate merchandising strategy should be and that's an important part of our optimism about the back half. Ken Goldman : Thank you for that. One more if I can. I want to ask you about the specific media reports. I know you can't address them directly but I'm curious if you can help us understand how integrated the Philadelphia brand is with the rest of your European grocery business. I'm curious on a hypothetical basis, how hard would be to disassociate that brand and that brand alone from everything you're doing over there? Irene Rosenfeld : That's a very hypothetical question. I would say that as we are basically dealing with the transformation in the European region, we are setting up a standalone cheese and grocery unit because I believe that is the best way for us to focus uniquely on those assets as distinct from some of our other assets. So as coffee moves into the joint venture, we'll have a snacking unit and a cheese and grocery unit, and I think that's the best way to manage those businesses going forward. Ken Goldman : Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse. Rob Moskow : Thank you. I guess a couple of questions, Irene. Your results in China after the last three quarters have been quite strong, up high single-digit. A lot of your peers have experienced significant inventory de-loading because of retailer slowdowns. Can you tell us about why you're bucking the trend there? Is this an easy comp from a year ago? Or is there something particular happening to your market share over there? And then the second question is on copy, I think the last time we talked about the divestiture, it would be accretive but maybe dilutive for the first six months. Can you give us any update there? Thanks. Irene Rosenfeld : I'm very pleased with the perform of our business in China. I think actually we're not bucking the trend we actually live that trend. If you recall about a year and a half ago we ran into challenges as we saw demands slowing down quite rapidly and our inventories were not keeping pace with that. So as we talked about it we implemented a number of management tools and measurement tools to ensure that we had a good handle on sell in and sell out and that serving is exceptionally well so I think in many respects we were ahead of that curve and we've now got back behind us. I'm particularly pleased though with the resurgence of the biscuit business which is a critically-important business for us. Oreo had a very strong quarter and is a strong contributor to the overall business performance and gum just continues to be on fire and so net/net I think our Chinese business we learned a lot in the early days as we observed what happens when consumption slows down. I think we've got a much better balance between sell in and sell out the team is executing well and I'm extremely pleased with their performance. So we're cautiously optimistic but the continued performance of the biscuit category is important to us. On coffee, Rob, we don't really have an update what we had said was we expected in 2016 that it will be accretive, we have no reason to believe that's not true at this point and the business has performed well. They had a very good first quarter for us and we'll wait to see really we get the approval from the European commission and then that will trigger our ability to get in and really do more detail planning with our partners. Rob Moskow : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman with Deutsche Bank. Eric Katzman : I guess first, just a specific question, Brian. You kind of mentioned in the Asia-Pacific that a tax incentive helped gross margin, or the phase out of the tax incentive, why is a tax incentive an operating factor? Brian Gladden : It was a hurt in the quarter. We had historically an attack structure in place in China that allowed us, it basically showed up in our operating results and reduced our costs. That has been phased out in a decision by the government. We began to face into that at the end of last year and it had a relatively significant impact in the quarter on AP's results. I would say, as I said, they did have strong gross margin improvements they also reduced overheads, if you take that out, they had margins up in the quarter. Eric Katzman : Okay. Just in terms of \u2013 I realize obviously currency is a massive headwind to earnings, but I think last quarter, maybe you had kind of said that in dollar terms, earnings per share for the year would be at least $1.70 and that included $0.30 of at least FX headwind but it also included the coffee still being in the base, but you're also suggesting that between \u2013 interest expense will be a benefit by a couple of pennies, currency is worse, your tax rate is growing now as a slight negative. So can you give us a sense as to what you're thinking on a dollar earnings basis for the year? Is it basically unchanged also with all those things moving around? Brian Gladden : In essence we're not really \u2013 we haven't updated the outlook for EPS, what we did highlight is the fact that interest expense will be down a bit, tax will be up a bit. I think those things would basically offset the change relative to currency is about a $0.03 difference from when we last updated you, so $0.30 going to $0.33. Eric Katzman : Okay. All right. I'll pass it on. Thank you. Brian Gladden : Thanks, Eric. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Ken Zaslow : Good morning, everyone. Irene Rosenfeld : Good morning. Ken Zaslow : North America as you said seems to be expanding margins before the Salinas plant and I didn't really understand for sure but it seems like maybe that is going \u2013 that margin expansion is actually going ahead of schedule. Does that mean that you think that of the areas out there that North America has the greatest opportunity to expand margins on top of where we're going from today? Is that a fair point? Brian Gladden : I'm not sure I'd say that. I think we've highlighted the opportunity related to Salinas and how much margin impact we would have. I mean as we've talked about and Daniel talked about at CAGNY, as we implement lines of the future, those opportunities exist broadly across the other regions as well. They will be likely one of the first to feel the benefit of the new supply chain capabilities and the lower cost. The team has done a nice job managing through productivity, they've done a nice job managing through overheads and I would say they're a bit ahead in the process. Irene Rosenfeld : And also, Ken, that's one of the areas that we have of greatest return on our marketing investments and we're going to continue as our capacity comes on stream, as I mentioned a few minutes ago, as our capacity comes on stream that's an area where we're going to continue to invest as we see the margin progression. Ken Zaslow : Great. And on that point and I just want to \u2013 you also said the back of the year you're expecting to increase your advertising spend behind new product innovation. Can you talk about, assuming you're not going to tell us what new product innovation, but can you talk about region and categories where you'd see the acceleration of new product innovation? Irene Rosenfeld : You're going to see it around the world. I mean one of our strong suits has been the strong performance of our innovations and I think as we continue to move to a region category model, we are finding that we're able to expand our proven platforms even faster. So as you think about different innovations within our categories, Oreo thins in China is performing exceptionally well and you'll start to see that make its way around the world. I talked about the belVita line extensions that are doing well and that continues to be an area of opportunity. Within chocolate, we've got continued terrific response, continued terrific response in Bubbly and Marvellous Creations and you'll see us expanding those. And gum and candy we've got a series of innovations. Trident Unwrapped here in the U.S. is the first slab gum that you can get in the bottle and it's off to a good start and so that you'll see that when we'll play an important role as well as in China for example where we're actually going to launch a second line. We've got our Stride brand that has done exceptionally well. We're now going to be launching Trident in China. So in many cases what we're talking about are the expansion of proven platforms around the world. Ken Zaslow : Great. I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi. David Driscoll : Great. Thank you and good morning. Just two detailed questions and then a bigger picture question for you, Irene. Brian, on the share repurchase I think your slide said you did $1.75 billion of share repo in the quarter. I think your target for the year was between $1 billion and $2 billion. So would this mean that you've done the share repurchase that you wanted to do for the full year or is there any more to go? Brian Gladden : Yeah, we've done 1.5 in the quarter and what we said was we do up for two so I would suspect it will do up to two. That's what we said. David Driscoll : Okay. So there's a little bit more to go. Fine. Now marketing, Irene I think you said on the quarter it was flat on a constant currency basis. Does that mean that with FX it was down about 14%? Irene Rosenfeld : Directionally I don't know quite how the currencies flow through the medium money but it would be, you know, and obviously particularly in the emerging markets it would be down a little bit. I think the important point is that particularly given the aggressive pricing, we have really focused on making sure that we've got adequate marketing support behind our brands, and particularly our power brands, and that's been a key driver of their strong performance. The aggregate A&C that I reference that was down slightly, again, that was primarily nonworking spending that we will continue to look for efficiency opportunities. So A&C is a key driver of the strong performance of our power brands which are up about 6 % in the quarter and they will continue to be the focus of our investment as we look out to the balance of the year. David Driscoll : And then, Irene, just \u2013 Kraft tie-ins uncovered a fairly massive cost savings in their merger announcement. You do have a rather unique position in analyzing kind of what they've done. The question here is a Mondelez question, though. In thinking about Mondelez, do you see further opportunities for larger cost savings and higher EBIT margins after you hit the 15% to 16% target? Irene Rosenfeld : Yeah, Dave, clearly the Heinz model is something that the entire industry is watching. And we are watching very closely just to see how that plays out. At the moment, we're quite comfortable with our approach. I think we've got a good balance between top line and bottom line. I think the margin performance that we're delivering both in terms of gross margin as well as operating margin is strong and where we'd hoped it was going to be. And so I'm quite confident that the programs as we have laid them out today leave us well-positioned not only to deliver our 2015 targets but also to deliver the targets that we've laid out into the future. So we'll keep watching and learning, but I'm quite confident with the approach and the path that we're on. David Driscoll : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey. Good morning, folks. Brian Gladden : Good morning, Jason. Jason English : Irene, I want to pick up on a comment you just made in response to the last question, a good balance of top line and bottom line growth. Looking at results over the last year or so, it really felt like the balance was not really balanced at all but shifted heavily towards priming the pumps for margin expansion, with the top line faltering as a result of whether it be executional issues, conscious decisions to exit things, et cetera. Do you think that's a fair characterization, first? And then secondly, do you truly believe that we're getting back into a better balanced algorithm on a go forward? And if so, what's the enabler that's allowing you to shift more focus back to driving sales in conjunction with margin? Irene Rosenfeld : Jason, I think it's a fair characterization. I think we were very clear to say first things first. We needed to get our gross margins on our key franchises where we wanted them to be. And then we were going to be in a position to start to spend back, and that's exactly what we're doing. And so certainly, as we've said, there'll be more opportunity to spend back in the back half as more things kick in on the cost side. But even now, we're already starting to make some adjustments to our spending and making sure we're focusing it on the target areas that we think we can get the best return and where we think we need to protect the franchises. So I think you're seeing the algorithm play through in a more balanced \u2013 you will see the algorithm play through in a more balanced way this year than perhaps you would have seen last year, but we were just getting ourselves essentially staged to be able to deliver the cost profiles that we need so we have the fuel to invest in our franchises. Jason English : Thank you. That's helpful. One more, then I'll pass it on. As you were going through your prepared remarks, you listed a lot of things that should get better on a go forward. You're strategic decisions to exit business, the headwind is more pronounced, it should get easier. You're looking for better category growth in a number of markets as consumers adjust to price points. You're looking for better market share improvement on a go forward. Lots of things you talked about in terms of anticipation of getting better. I guess my question is do you need it all to get better to deliver your numbers? Or are is there enough flexibility in the algorithm of go forward to absorb a few of those things maybe not going the right way and still hit your numbers? Irene Rosenfeld : I think were well-positioned if you do the math. Given our strong start to the year, we feel quite comfortable with the guidance that we've laid out. It's a solid start. We're executing well, and there are some things that we believe will go our way in the back half. But we continue to believe that the guidance that we're giving you is quite prudent, and we feel quite confident in the full-year projections. Jason English : Okay. I'll pass it on. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Alexia Howard : Good morning, everyone. Irene Rosenfeld : Good morning, Alexia. Brian Gladden : Hi, Alexia. Alexia Howard : So just a quick question on the Enjoy Life acquisition. If I think back to when you were still with combined with Kraft, there were a number of those sort of health and wellness oriented brands, like Back to Nature that never really seemed to find their place properly in the portfolio. They kind of got lost. As you think about buying Enjoy Life and try to figure how to scale that, what's different this time around? And do you have an appetite for doing more of those kinds of deals over time? Thank you very much and I'll pass it on. Irene Rosenfeld : Well, Alexia, without a doubt, better-for-you snacking is on trend. It's resonating well with our consumers around the world, and therefore, it will continue to be an important focus area for us. We've learned a lot from the Back to Nature experience, and in fact, we still have an ownership of that business. As we bring Enjoy Life into the portfolio we've announced that we're going to keep the management separate and I think that's an important enabler to make sure that we get the lessons that we need, we learn the lessons but at the same time we're allowing the team that has been so successful to continue to drive the business. So I think you should expect to continue to see us building on our Better For You snacks both organically and through M&A and enjoy life becomes an important cornerstone of that effort. Alexia Howard : Thank you very much. I'll pass it on. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Consumer Edge. Rob Dickerson : Thank you very much. Just a bit of a follow-up question that Jason had, it seems like at the end of last year I think your categories were growing I believe it was 3.6% and you had said 2015 might be a little bit lower around 3% than in Q1 you're putting up 4.8% in global category growth. I think you'd said even expect to potentially see the chocolate accelerate in the back half of the year. So if you expect \u2013 if we're seeing much faster growth that you saw in 2014 in Q1 in your categories and you're also expecting some of those categories to accelerate and you expect to gain share as price gaps narrow, why wait or why not really increase your top line organic sales growth guidance especially if comps aren't becoming more difficult? Thank you. Irene Rosenfeld : Rob the first point is over the long-term there is no question we expect to grow at or above category rates. As we said though in 2015, we are very clearly prioritizing margin expansion over revenue growth. It reflects the challenging environment and we've got a very significant transformation we want to make sure that in all cases that our managers are able to make the appropriate trade-offs. So we feel good about the revenue growth in the first quarter, we're very pleased to see that the snacks business in particular is up around 4.5% which is a trend change from the end of last year but I think you also need to get underneath the covers a little bit on that number. A big driver of that 4.5% improvement was the 6.5% growth in chocolate which is largely price driven as we've said, also benefited somewhat from the Easter shift. So the good news is we are starting to see pricing coming through and that's critical to our overall algorithm as we're said. Our mix is still soft and we're taking some actions in the coming months and quarters to make sure that we start to see our shares rebound. So net, we're cautiously optimistic about the improved category growth, but we'd like to see more than the first quarter to feel confident about that. Rob Dickerson : Okay. Great. Fair enough. Just a quick technical question and hopefully I'm explaining this the right way. But it looks like in the first quarter you bought back the 1.5 billion in shares part of that you could argue was funded by the proceeds that you got from the currency hedges off the coffee divestiture. Without that you might be apt to raise more debt to buy back the stock or whatever and not buyback. So I'm just curious, when you announced the coffee JV, the euro was close to 140. Now current market it's around 111 so it seemed like and I think you put this within the footnotes of the release, it seems like the cash proceeds now you would receive on a dollar basis our less, which could potentially mean that you'd be able to buy back less stock with those proceeds. But at the same time you're buying back more stock in Q1 off of the benefit of this currency hedge. So it would seem like \u2013 I guess the question is, is it fair to say that maybe some of that accretion just off of the shift in the euro has already occurred? Thank you. Brian Gladden : I mean, the simple way to think about it is, we locked in the rate last spring, and I think we locked it in, in the range of 1.37 euro which basically protected our dollar proceeds from the transaction. So what we did was really take that favorability from a timing standpoint and just basically cash some of that in during the course of the fourth quarter and the first quarter. So we locked in our proceeds, our proceeds will not go down given what's happening currency that was the intent of the hedge all along was to lock that in and it locks it in \u2013 the value is in the range of $5.5 billion. Rob Dickerson : Yeah, you just hopefully get more of a benefit upfront off of just weighted average shares outstanding. Okay. Brian Gladden : Just liquidity in the short-term, yeah. Rob Dickerson : Fair enough. All right, thank you very much. I appreciate it. Operator : We've reached the allotted time for questions and answers today. I would now like to turn the conference over to Dexter Congbalay. Please go ahead. Dexter Congbalay : Thanks, everyone, for joining. I'll be available via phone for obviously all day today and over the next few days. I just ask for a little bit of patience. I'm all but lonesome right now. So if you have any questions, just give me a call later. Thank you. Operator : Thank you for participating in today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.",

Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Mondelez International's second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Mondelez management and the question-and-answer session.  I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dexter Congbalay, Vice President, Investor Relations, from Mondelez International. Dexter Congbalay - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning, and thanks for joining us. With me are Irene Rosenfeld, our Chairman and CEO, and Brian Gladden, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our earnings release and today's slides, which are available on our website, mondelezinternational.com. As you know, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation. In addition, please note that our second quarter and first half financials include the results of our coffee business, which we combined with D.E. Masters Blenders effective July 2, to create Jacobs Douwe Egberts. Separately today via form AK filed with the SEC we provided pro forma non-GAAP financial results that reflect the impact of the coffee business divestiture and other adjustments for 2014 and the first half of 2015, by quarter. As described later, these pro forma adjusted financial results serve as the basis of our updated 2015 outlook. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Irene. Irene Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Dexter. Good morning. We had a strong second quarter. We built on our momentum from the start of the year, continuing to drive top year margin expansion and earnings growth, while also delivering solid organic revenue growth. Specifically, organic revenue grew 4.3%, led by pricing actions to recover commodity and currency-driven input costs. Adjusted gross margin increased 330 basis points, to 40.2%, driven by record net productivity, as well as 150 basis point benefit from mark-to-market of commodity and currency hedging contracts. We expanded adjusted operating income margin by 270 basis points, to 15.2%, while significantly increasing advertising and consumer support. And adjusted EPS was $0.47, up nearly 38% on a constant currency basis. Our strong year-to-date results reflect clear progress in the execution of our transformation agenda. Earlier this month, we closed two deals that will enable us to focus even more keenly on snacks. We combined our global coffee business with D.E. Masters Blenders, and we acquired the Kinh Do snacks business in Vietnam. On the cost front, we drove record net productivity in our supply chain and continued to reduce overheads as a percentage of revenue, driven by strong execution of our zero-based budgeting initiative. While continuing to improve profitability, we have also begun to stage the business for accelerated growth. In addition to significantly increasing advertising and consumer support, we brought more of our state-of-the-art production lines on stream to drive the growth of our Power Brands and innovation platforms. Our updated outlook for 2015 reflects the strong year-to-date performance of our ongoing business, as well as the continued progress on our transformation agenda. These solid results have enabled us to essentially offset the expected dilution related to the coffee transaction, including the near-term impact of stranded overhead costs. As a result, we're increasingly confident in our ability to deliver a 2016 adjusted operating income margin of 15% to 16%. Before jumping into the specifics of our Q2 performance, let me provide an update on our two recent portfolio actions. Earlier this month we closed our deal to combine our coffee business with D.E. Master Blenders creating Jacobs Douwe Egberts, the world's leading pure play coffee company. The company has revenues of more than \u20ac5 billion and market-leading positions in over 18 countries across Europe, Latin America and Australia as well as a strong emerging market presence. JDE owns some of the world's leading coffee brands, including Jacobs and Tassimo as well as Moccona, Douwe Egberts, and Pilao. With greater focused and increased scale, JDE will be able to capitalize on the global growth opportunities in coffee, and invest more heavily in innovation, manufacturing, and market development. At closing we received cash of \u20ac3.8 billion euros and a 43 1/2% interest in the new joint venture. These amounts are down somewhat versus previous estimates because we retained our interest in our Korea based joint venture Dong Suh Foods Corporation. Since we continue to hold that position, this doesn't affect the overall economics of the JDE deal. As previously stated, we'll use a majority of the cash proceeds to buy back shares. We now anticipate the transaction will be EPS neutral to slightly accretive in 2016, reflecting fewer than expected shares repurchased due to the increase in our stock price as well as JDE's expected divestitures to satisfy European regulators. Two weeks ago we also completed the acquisition of a controlling interest in the Kinh Do snacks business in Vietnam. In addition to leveraging Kinh Do's iconic brands and leading positions in biscuits and mooncakes, we'll invest to introduce our Power Brands into their broad distribution network covering 130,000 outlets. With the completion of the coffee transaction, on a pro forma basis snacks now represent nearly 85% of our revenue, up from 75%. This will enable us to further optimize our capital allocation and focus on accelerating the growth of our key franchises. As you can see on slide 7, biscuits and chocolate now make up nearly 70% of our revenue, with gum and candy at about 15%. Post-coffee, our beverages segment is now composed entirely of powdered beverages and will represent about 6% of revenue. Finally, cheese and grocery is about 10% of sales with a little less than half of the business in Europe. So let's turn to our Q2 performance. We delivered organic revenue growth of 4.3%. Similar to the first quarter, higher pricing drove our top line growth as we raised prices to recover higher input costs, including the impact of currency. As we've discussed before, this protects profits and enables us to continue to invest in our brands and innovation platforms. As expected, vol/mix continued to be soft due to elasticity as well as the impact of a number of strategic decisions we took to improve revenue mix. In aggregate these strategic decisions were a 60-basis point drag on vol/mix in Q2, and for the full year we expect them to be a 100 basis point headwind. In addition, the shift of Easter-related shipments into Q1 had a negative impact of about 50 basis points. Finally, to complete our revenue profile, Power Brands grew more than 6.5%. Emerging markets were up nearly 10%, with the BRIC countries also up about 10%. Finally, developed markets grew nearly a point. Turning now to our results by region, Latin America was up nearly 20% driven by the inflationary economies in Venezuela and Argentina. Brazil was up low single digits, as we priced to recover the inflation impact of a weaker real on input costs. In addition, Brazil slowed sequentially as the weak macro environment led to a significant deceleration in our categories. As you know, the Brazilian economy has been soft for some time. As a result, we've been closely monitoring and managing inventory levels so that we have no significant destocking surprises. We're pleased that our shares have held up well, and we'll continue to make the appropriate investments to drive further share gains. That said, Brazil's slowdown is an area we'll continue to watch closely in the second half, as we don't see any short-term catalyst for category improvement. Our EEMEA region grew 7%. As in the first quarter, this was primarily due to pricing. Our momentum in Russia continued with revenue up more than 20%. This growth was driven by pricing in response to the sharp devaluation of the ruble. Despite significantly higher prices however, vol/mix was flat as we increased brand support and expanded distribution. Performance was strong across all categories. Asia-Pacific was up 3%. We were pleased with the performance in China where growth accelerated to more than 20% behind strong execution in both biscuits and gum. India revenue growth was soft due to continued price elasticity in chocolate. India's another market that we're watching closely as we move through the second half. We're keeping a sharp eye on inventory levels as we increase A&C investment to help accelerate category growth. In North America revenue grew modestly behind improved biscuits growth in the U.S. We expect improved revenue growth in the second half as increased A&C and our new low-cost capacity comes online. Europe was also up modestly. Coffee posted strong growth as we increased trade inventories to ensure a smooth transition to JDE. As expected, however, Europe's ongoing business remained soft. Similar to Q1, vol/mix was pressured as strategic decisions to improve revenue mix tempered Europe's volumes, especially in chocolate, while the Easter shift also created a 60-basis point headwind. In addition, chocolate continued to be affected by negative volume elasticity as competitor pricing actions announced earlier in the year are not yet fully reflected on shelf. We anticipate revenue trends in Europe will improve in the second half as price gaps narrow and as our brands benefit from increased A&C support. Turning to our categories, year-to-date our snacks categories grew about 4.5% globally. Including beverages and cream cheese, our categories were up more than 5%. Our organic growth was about a point below that, again, reflecting the impact of our strategic decisions to improve revenue mix. While our financial results in the first half were strong, our year-to-date share performance is not where we want it to be. Only 45% of our revenue gained or held share, reflecting some sizable price gaps remaining in our categories, especially chocolate. Let's take a closer look at each category. The biscuits category grew more than 5.5% year-to-date. Our biscuits revenue growth was solid up nearly 5%, with strong performances in China, Brazil and Russia. Share performance was also strong with nearly two-thirds of revenue gaining or holding, including increases in both cookies and crackers in the U.S. Finally, Power Brands grew high single digits year-to-date, led by continued strength from Oreo, TUC, Club Social and Barni. Turning to chocolate, the category grew nearly 5% year-to-date, while our revenue was up only modestly. This was largely due to our performance in Europe, which accounts for about half of our global chocolate revenue. This also affected our share, with only about 25% of revenue gaining or holding. Although we typically don't cite short-term data, we are seeing some green shoots in our most recent share performance, reflecting the benefits of selected A&C increases as well as narrowing price gaps. In the U.K., for example, we captured more than two share points in the most recent four-week period. And in Germany, excluding the impact of some strategic decisions to exit low margin revenue, we increased share through higher marketing support and selective trade investments. In emerging markets, our year-to-date Chocolate revenue was up mid-single digits. In Russia, chocolate growth was strong, largely due to currency-driven price increases, but vol/mix was up as well. Share performance was also strong. In Brazil, year-to-date revenue growth has been solid and we continue to gain share, although, as I mentioned earlier, the category slowed in Q2 in response to the macro environment. In India, chocolate revenue was soft, as consumers have been slow to adapt to the higher prices we implemented last year. In each of our key chocolate markets, we expect revenue growth and share performance to continue to improve in the second half, as price gaps narrow further and as we step up A&C investments. Finally, in Gum and Candy, the category was up less than 2% year-to-date, but our revenue increased over 6.5%, with both gum and candy up mid-single digits, fueled by the launch of Trident in China, and by strong Halls' growth in the U.S. In sum, we're pleased with our solid top-line growth in the quarter, and with the early indicators of share improvement in response to increased A&C support. Let me now turn it over to Brian to provide an update on our margin expansion and earnings growth. Brian Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Irene, and good morning. As Irene highlighted, our Q2 results again demonstrate our ability to execute across multiple fronts of our transformation agenda, with great results in reducing costs, expanding margins and investing in growth. Starting with slide 11, you can see that adjusted gross margin increased 330 basis points in the second quarter, to more than 40%. Productivity drove more than half of the improvement, continuing our momentum from the first quarter and the second half of last year. In the quarter, we delivered strong net productivity of more than 3% of COGS, or about $175 million, which continues to be a record level of productivity for us, and benchmarks well versus peers. In addition, mark-to-market contribute 150 basis points to the margin expansion, as we adjusted the value of our currency and commodity positions that don't qualify for hedge accounting. Adjusted OI margin was up 270 basis points, to 15.2%. We took the opportunity to re-invest a portion of the cost savings into additional A&C spending to support top-line growth and market shares. As a result, A&C spending in the quarter grew double-digits on a constant currency basis, up 60 basis points as a percentage of revenue, to more than 9%. Consistent with our plans to deliver both top tier revenue growth and margin expansion, we'll continue to invest some of the additional cost savings into high ROI initiatives. As a result, we expect A&C spending to continue to increase as a percentage of revenue in the second half. We'll talk more about this when we present at the Back-to-School Conference in early September. As you can see on slide 12, we expanded adjusted OI margins in all but one region. North America's margin was up modestly, as we re-invested some of the productivity in overhead savings into higher marketing and merchandising support. Margins in Europe, Latin America, and Asia-Pacific were up sharply, driven by strong productivity and overhead leverage, which also fueled increased A&C spending in these regions. In EEMEA, adjusted OI margin was down 120 basis points as we continued to price to recover currency-driven input cost inflation in Russia and the Ukraine. Considering the massive dislocation we saw in these markets in the first months of the year, we have made solid progress here in rebuilding our margins. Adjusted EPS was $0.47 per share, up nearly 38% on a constant currency basis. Operating gains accounted for $0.06 of the increase, despite the impact of approximately $0.04 of higher A&C spending. The year-over-year change in mark-to-market accounting accounted for the other $0.06. Below the operating line, lower interest expense and outstanding shares each added $0.02, while a higher tax rate was a penny drag. After accounting for the $0.08 currency headwind, adjusted EPS was still up more than 17%. On slide 14, you can see that we returned $2.7 billion of capital to our shareholders in the first half. We purchased $2.2 billion of stock, more than 58 million shares, at an average price of a little more than $37 a share. This increased level of buyback reflects our ability to pull in a substantial portion of our planned buyback related to the coffee proceeds as we leverage the hedge gains of about $1 billion related to the transaction. In addition, we increased our share repurchase authorization program by $6 billion to a total of $13.7 billion and extended the expiration by two years through 2018. As a result, we can purchase up to $6.9 billion of stock over the next three and a half years. We also paid nearly $500 million in dividends in the first half. In addition, last week we announced a 13% increase in our regular quarterly dividend to $0.17 a share, reflecting our continued confidence in delivering on our long-term commitments. Let's turn to our outlook for the year. Now that the coffee transaction is complete we'll give you a sense for what to expect for the remainder of the year. As you've seen through the first half, our ongoing business has been performing above our previous outlook. In our updated outlook we continue that momentum. There's several moving parts and we've provide on slide 15 the key elements of our outlook. To help you determine the appropriate comparative historical financial results to use, earlier today we issued an 8-K with pro forma adjusted financials by quarter for 2014 and the first half of 2015. The adjustments primarily involved moving our higher margin coffee business out of our reported operating income and reclassifying the after-tax income to below OI using the equity method. This is also how we'll record our portion of the after-tax earnings from JDE going forward. Let's start with our revenue outlook. For the second half we expect organic growth of at least 3% versus the second half 2014 revenue base of $15.2 billion, which excludes coffee. This target reflects the underlying momentum of our ongoing business, which was up 3.2% in the first half. So for the full year this implies organic growth of at least 3%. That's up from our previous target of at least 2%, which included coffee for the full year. On an apples-to-apples basis, this is an increase in our revenue guidance. In addition, we expect a better balance between price and vol/mix in the second half as price gaps narrow, as our share performance improves, as we increase our A&C spending, and as we lap the impact of our strategic decisions to exit lower margin businesses. Currency, however, will continue to be a sizable headwind. Based on current spot rates especially with the continued weakening of the euro, we estimate currency will have a negative impact of approximately 11 percentage points in the second half. Turning to margin, in the second half we expect to deliver adjusted OI margin of at least 14%, despite stepping up A&C spending and absorbing a number of headwinds related to the coffee divestiture. That's up from 12.6% in the second half of last year. On an apples-to-apples basis, this reflects a margin upside for our ongoing business which offsets both the coffee impacts and higher A&C investment. As I said earlier, we're making good progress in building sustainable momentum in the execution of our supply chain reinvention program and in reducing overheads. Through the first six months we've delivered strong net productivity even before realizing any meaningful benefits from the new state-of-the-art assets that are now coming on stream. As discussed at CAGNY, in addition to the four lines that are up and running now in our Salinas, Mexico biscuit facility, in the coming months we have new high-speed and lower-cost production lines being installed in the U.S., in Europe, in India, China and in other markets. As expected, we should begin to see the benefits from these new lines in the second half. And yesterday we announce a $130 million investment to install an additional four biscuit lines in Salinas, replacing nine older inefficient lines in our Chicago biscuit plant. We expect these new lines to be on-stream in mid-2016. In terms of overheads, cost as a percentage of revenue are also down in the first half. In fact, in each of the indirect cost packages we highlighted at CAGNY, we're delivering savings that are on, or better than target, and so we're increasing our cost reduction expectations. We're also on track with respect to our migration to global shared services, which will simplify and streamline our back office processes and better leverage our scale. Our shared services initiatives will begin to provide savings next year. Cost reductions in our ongoing business will more than offset the dilutive impacts of three items surrounding the coffee deal. First, the coffee business we divested has a higher margin than our ongoing business. In 2014 the coffee business had an adjusted OI margin of approximately 17% versus about 13% for the total company. Second, the divestiture results in some stranded overheads, while the dilutive effect of stranded costs will be more pronounced in the third quarter, this impact is temporary. We expect to fully offset the impacts with additional cost reductions by the end of the year. Third, and in conjunction with the creation of the coffee JV, we've reclassified after-tax income related to joint ventures in which we have a minority interest from above operating income to below the line to be consistent with how we account for equity earnings from JDE. The largest of these is our Korean coffee-related JV. Together these three items are expected to pressure margins in the second half by 75 basis points to 100 basis points. Despite these margin impacts from the transaction, we continue to expect adjusted OI margin to expand significantly for the full year, from a pro forma adjusted margin of 12% in 2014, we expect to deliver pro forma adjusted OI margin of approximately 14% in 2015, excluding a temporary negative impact of 20 basis points to 30 basis points from stranded costs. Importantly, with momentum from our supply chain and overhead cost savings programs, we're increasingly confident in our ability to deliver adjusted OI margin of 15% to 16% in 2016. Now turning to EPS, we continue to expect to deliver double-digit adjusted EPS growth on a constant currency basis for the full year, versus a 2014 adjusted EPS baseline of $1.75. The margin expansion in our ongoing business is anticipated to drive the bulk of the increase while lower interest expense and a lower share count are also expected to provide some benefit. These benefits will be partially offset by the dilution related to the coffee divestiture. We do expect our year-over-year margin and EPS growth to be more fourth quarter weighted given that in Q3 we'll have a more pronounced impact from stranded costs from front loading A&C spending and from an expected year-over-year mark-to-market headwind. Our currency headwind estimate for the year is unchanged at $0.33. With respect to JDE, to estimate our total adjusted EPS you'll need to be able to estimate the JV's net income. However, since it's a private company that we don't control, disclosure regarding its financial results will be somewhat limited. On slide 20 we've provided a framework for JDE's income statement. Now looking at how we'll use the cash proceeds from the coffee deal. At closing we received \u20ac3.8 billion of cash, which we hedged at the time of the agreement in May 2014. So effectively we received approximately $5.2 billion. We're returning about $2.9 billion via increased share buybacks, about $900 million of which we pulled into the first half of the year. We'll deploy the remaining $2 billion over the next 12 months. We'll use approximately $1.6 billion to pay down commercial paper. And we'll use the remaining $700 million for other corporate purposes, including funding the Kinh Do deal. For your convenience we've summarized the elements of our updated earnings outlook on slide 22. In addition, let me provide you with a few other items to help you update your financial models. With respect to interest expense, given that commercial paper is a low-cost form of financing, the paydown of $1.6 billion of CP is not expected to have a meaningful impact on our interest expense in the second half. As a result, we still anticipate interest expense to be around $375 million in the back half, and $750 million for the year. We expect our tax rate to be in the high-teens in the second half, down from a pro forma adjusted rate of nearly 25% in the first half, due to reductions in statutory rates in certain countries. For the year, we expect our pro forma tax rate to be in the low 20's. We're also increasing our free cash flow outlook for our ongoing business by about $400 million. This is driven by our strong year-to-date margin performance and continued solid working capital management. This increase, however, is more than offset by the divestiture of the coffee business. So to wrap up, we delivered strong first half results with top tier margin expansion and earnings growth, while also stepping up investments to support future growth and improve market share. Our updated 2015 outlook reflects this momentum, as well as the opportunity to fund additional A&C support, while absorbing the dilutive impact of the coffee transaction. As a result, we're confident we can continue to build upon this momentum and deliver our 2016 adjusted OI margin target of 15% to 16%. With that, let's open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good morning, everyone. There are some moving pieces within annual guidance. So I'm just hoping maybe you can help us quantify some of the changes on an apples-to-apples basis, excluding coffee. And you gave some of this directionally already. I appreciate that. But just hoping we can get some numbers, I guess, on like-for-like sales, margins? How that guidance is changing? Brian Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Ken, Sure. There are quite a few moving pieces. I guess I'd start \u2013 I mean, clearly, a strong first half by almost any financial metric, and we're ahead of our outlook for the first half on both growth and margins. I guess the simple answer is, we're increasing net organic revenue outlook from 2% plus to 3% plus, and we think that's a prudent increase given what we're seeing in the markets today. On OI margins, we're still at about 14% for the year, and basically offsetting the dilution in the coffee transaction with underlying margins really improving. So, our year-over-year OI margin improvement is now about 170 basis points. And when you go back to our original outlook, the prior 14% was an improvement year-over-year of 110 basis points. So, I think that's one of the ways to look at this and feel good about the outlook that we've just given. And then hanging on, obviously, despite the dilution to double-digit adjusted EPS growth at constant currency. Those, I think, are the big elements at a very high level. Happy to get more into the mechanics if you want, but I think those are the headlines. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : No, we can follow up after. Thanks very much. Brian Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Ken. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning, everybody. Brian Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Andrew. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: If I'm hearing you guys correctly, it sort of sounds like you've reached a point where you have the margin sort of flywheel going, so to speak, and are now more comfortable gearing up spending maybe to drive a better balance right between the top-line and margin. So, if I have that right, in light of that, is it too early to talk about what you see as the right longer term EBIT margin? Is 15% to 16% the right level, with upside from there going to the top-line? Is there potentially still more there, even with the increased A&C spending? I'm trying to get a better sense of that, and then I've got a quick follow-up. Brian Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, yeah. Look, I think, Andrew, we're increasingly confident as we move through the year and see the execution here both in the margins, and I think we feel great about the ability to begin to put some investment on the A&C side, behind growth. I think as we move through the year and, obviously, we'll give you an updated outlook for next year as we get into the first part of the year, will probably give you a sense for where we go from there. But as we've talked about, there clearly are continued margin opportunities beyond what we see for 2015 to 2016. As we look at the supply chain reinvention and restructuring activities that are going on, we would expect to have further margin opportunities. And I think it really comes down to striking that balance between growth and margin. And we want to retain some of that flexibility to strike that balance, depending upon how the market plays out. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. And then a quick follow-up, I think on the last call, Irene, you may have talked about raising promotional activity in 2Q, specifically in chocolate in Europe, as the competitor price increases probably wouldn't really hit until the third quarter. And I think the gap between Chocolate category and Mondelez' growth in the quarter was still quite wide. So, I guess I'm just trying to get a sense of, would you have expected better share performance in the 2Q, given some of the additional spending you were going to do? And, if so, I guess, what caused the gap to still be as wide as it was? Irene Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, actually, Andrew, Q2 played out pretty much as we has expected, in Europe. There's no question, we're continuing to feel the impact of having led price. We're seeing volume elasticity and share play out essentially the way we had thought. And as I mentioned in my script, in the second quarter we did increase some promotional and A&C support in markets like the U.K. and Germany, and we are starting to see some responses there. But don't forget that Europe is really the main place where the strategic decisions have an impact, and that's about a 60 basis point impact to top-line, as well as Europe has a disproportionately large Easter business, and that's about 50 basis points on the top-line. So, the combination of those two things need to be added back to the overall performance. So net-net, we're not entirely pleased yet with our performance in Europe, but it is playing out, essentially, the way we had expected. And we do expect back half to see stronger performance as price gaps narrow, as we start to see our competitor pricing playing through in the marketplace, and as we reinvest some of our savings into more A&C support. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thanks very much. Dexter Congbalay - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Andrew. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thank you. Definitely positive news to know that you feel comfortable re-investing in A&C I think that there's been several months of conservatism there. Can you quantify how much you're raising that for the year, in dollar terms? And then also, can you give me a sense of like \u2013 there's some geographies that you've talked about where you really are warning that the categories might take a turn for the worse because of macro factors. And, in the past, I think Mondelez has had trouble bending that trend. I can think of China, a couple years ago, as a point in fact. So, are you going to spend that money to protect and gain share, or are you going to try to drive category growth? And, if so, isn't that a much tougher kind of task? Irene Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Actually, Rob, we're not going to provide numbers on our spending for the full year. What we did say is that we had a significant increase in the quarter. It's actually up double-digits year-over-year. And we're going to continue to strike a balance between places where we want to make sure that we're protecting share until price gaps narrow, places like the U.K. and Germany, but we're also spending money in markets like the U.S. biscuit market. And we were pleased to see, in the second quarter, a change in trend there. That market had been quite slow, and we started to see growth coming back there. So, it will be a balance. The operative thought here is to make sure that we're getting good ROI. But in markets I talked about, Brazil and India, I would say, given the dynamics in Brazil, it's probably going to be much more about share protection. In a market like India, we're about 65% of the category. And we believe that, therefore, our spending can help to stimulate the consumer acceptance of the higher price points. So it's a balance. But net-net, it gives us great confidence that we should see, as we make these investments, we should see improvement in our revenue rate of revenue growth, as well as our share performance. Robert B. Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Dexter Congbalay - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Rob. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel. Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Brian Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Chris. Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. I just had two questions for you, if I could please. I wanted to ask about the gross margin. I think, with some of the disclosure you've given in the release and in the slides, roughly half the benefit came from productivity, roughly half from the mark-to-market. I guess I'm trying to understand like, from an underlying basis pricing volume, was there a benefit to the gross margin? And then, related to that, productivity savings, when you cite productivity savings, are those inclusive of the Salinas plant, for example, some of the lines of the future? Are you incorporating that in when you talk productivity? Brian Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Chris, so the two things we talked about, we're not going to fully parse the gross margin for you, but productivity, it ends up being about 180 basis point help in the quarter. We talked about market-to-market 150 basis points, so the two of those are about the number. The reality is there's some other smaller things moving around. And when you look at price net of commodities within the quarter, we saw positive dollar impact there, but it would've been negative on the margin rate, not enough price to offset the full impact of commodity inflation in the rate. So that's the dynamic. We would be in the quarter actually absorbing start-up costs related to the start-up of some of these lines. So for the most part, the new lines would be a headwind to gross margins, a modest one, not a big one at this point. Okay? Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah, that's very good color. Thank you. And I guess I just have one overall question, maybe a big picture question, Irene. Looking at some of the emerging markets, we've heard some disclosure on India and Brazil, and one in particular that's gotten a lot of interest has been China. I know you've gone through an issue there a year or 18 months ago. And I just wanted to get a better sense in that market. It sounds like you're watching inventory levels closely. Just how consumption trends are perhaps changing and how consumption overall is holding up in that market? Irene Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, look, we know that some of our peers have had some challenges. We had challenges of our own, as you recall, back in 2013, and we very quickly have addressed them. We've taken a number of steps, aside from very closely monitoring inventory versus consumption, as you said. We've invested quite significantly in category growth in biscuits as well as in our innovation platforms. So we've invested behind Oreo, behind the launch of Oreo Thins, which has been off to a terrific start. We've seen very nice improvement in our shares as a result of that, and we're seeing the biscuit category is starting to improve after quite some time of being essentially flat. We're also launching our belVita product as we speak, and that will have a nice impact. So a lot of the good work that's going on in China is our opportunity to control our own destiny by making sure that we have the adequate spending behind our franchises, as well as adequate strong innovation platforms. On the gum side I'm quite pleased with the performance. Stride continues to do well. We continue to innovate behind that franchise in terms of the launch of bottles and Stride Layers, but we also just recently introduced Trident into the market and it's off to a very strong start. So we're cautiously optimistic. We're continuing to keep our eye very closely on the dynamic in the market. But I think we've got our hands firmly on the key levers that will help to fuel our business. Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And do you see eCommerce sales becoming an issue for consumption and the patterns of consumption for consumers in that market? Irene Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I actually don't see it as an issue, I see it as an opportunity. And we're continuing \u2013 we'll be talking about that more at our Back-to-School Conference. We're continuing to see some very nice growth in our eCommerce business, particularly in markets like China. Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Look forward to that. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: I wanted to pick up on some of the questions on chocolate. Irene, you mentioned some optimism on share improvement with price gap scenario in the back half of the year. Can you talk about the progression on price gaps through the quarter and whether or not you've seen some of those narrow into Q end? Irene Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, without a doubt some of the actions that we took particularly in Europe and particularly in the U.K. and Germany have helped to narrow some of those gaps as well as, as we see our competitor pricing coming through in markets like Germany, that also helps to narrow the gap. So I want to back up a little bit. In aggregate we had very strong performance in our emerging markets, up mid-single digits. The challenge, as I've said, has been in Europe, and again it's in large measure due to the fact that we led pricing, we took some fairly sizable increases in response to both commodities as well as ForEx. And we do expect improvement in the second half as we \u2013 as our competitor pricing comes through and as we start to continue to make investments in A&C. Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. That's helpful. And yeah, Europe, especially when we strip out coffee, with this AK restatement looks surprisingly soft. Can you talk maybe about the grocery business and its contribution? We've heard a lot on the snack portfolio, not a lot on just the core cheese and grocery business. Can you talk about how that's performing both in Europe and abroad? And how you're seeing that performance change after the decision to sort of operationally carve it out at least in Europe? I think that was some point last year. Irene Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, first, Jason, again, let me remind you, as you look at our Europe, we're not satisfied with our European revenue performance. But remember, it's got an Easter headwind, it's got the impact of some of the decisions we made to improve revenue mix as well as the elasticity. So it's got some other factors in there that are causing the overall performance. But that said, we're not pleased with it and we are expecting, given the investments that we're making as well as the closure of price gaps in the course of the back half. We should see some improvement. Cheese and groceries is actually performing quite well. The margins are good, the cash flow is good. We had solid growth in the quarter as well as year-to-date. Our Philadelphia brand is performing exceptionally well, it was up high single digits. So we're feeling quite good about that business. Jason M. English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: That's great. Thanks a lot. I'll pass it on. Irene Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning; everyone. Dexter Congbalay - Vice President- Investor Relations : Hey, Matthew. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hey. Just two questions, Brian, I wanted to follow up on the revenue outlook and some of the potential swing factors there. Obviously we talked a lot about some of the key emerging markets. But I think you're also moving into a second phase of VVB (45:41), which could include some incremental focus on head count. So just curious, are you building in any operational conservatism or expectation of disruption into the second half sales outlook for that reason? Brian Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Look, I think as we look at the top line, it's a prudent plan. I think we've got \u2013 as we called out a couple markets that we have a little bit of concern about. And we've obviously taken a little bit more of a prudent view because of that. I would also say in general the transformation continues, and whether it's supply chain reinvention and potential challenges that might come as we rationalize our planned footprint, invest in new capacity, or whether it's the broader activities around shared services and the impact that that's going to have, those are things that continue as we move over the next 18 months even 24 months. So clearly those are the two things that I would call out as we think about that revenue guidance of 3% plus. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. But not necessarily something you would call out as being an expected source of near-term volatility? Brian Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No. We're managing it. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And then just a \u2013 Irene, as we think about the continued volatility in some of your key emerging markets again, could you just remind us where your capabilities stand right now, and what you've done over the course of the past year or two in terms of tracking inventory levels, managing them closely, and sort of being able to quickly respond to any rapid changes that may occur in category growth from here? Irene Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Matthew, as we've shared with you, we've made significant changes in the templates that we use to manage the business as well as the training that we're giving to our colleagues in the individual markets. And so we've got great visibility. We look at the business on a monthly basis, and we've got the KPIs that are critical to our success. Those are the ones that we're monitoring. So I feel very good that we've got our finger on the pulse of the business, and we've got much greater visibility into the various levels of demand as well as the execution against that. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thank you both. Brian Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Matthew. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, good morning, everyone. Brian Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Bryan. Irene Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Bryan. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Two quick ones for me. First, Brian, on the margin outlook for 2015 for the full year, does it assume that the mark-to-market benefit that you've had year-to-date reverses itself, so it's essentially neutral for the year? Or does it assume that we hang on to some of the benefit for the full year? Brian Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hard to predict, Bryan. I would say as we think about the second half, it's relatively modest. We see, as we've said, relative to the third quarter we've got year-over-year challenges given some favorability last year. But as we look at the rest of the year, not a big swinger, not a big swinger at this point. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Not a big swinger for the full year or the second half? Because it's had an effect on the first half. That's what I was trying to understand whether or not it's kind of where when we end the year, do we end the year with a mark-to-market benefit that we didn't expect when the year started? Brian Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I would say we'll have a slight mark-to-market benefit for the total year. Yeah. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right, got it. Thank you. And then the second one, Irene, as you've had the opportunity and made the decision to re-invest some of the margin upside in advertising and in A&C, has the category, the change that you made last year to a more category-led model, has that framework given you more confidence in the ability to invest, where to invest, what to invest in? Just trying to get a sense for how that has had an impact, or if it has had an impact, on some of the decision-making and the effectiveness of that spending. Irene Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Without a doubt, Bryan. Frankly, it's also the answer as a follow-up to Matthew's questions. We're continuing to build capabilities, particularly in our emerging markets. And this category structure is helping to ensure that we transfer the knowledge. So, without a doubt, I have greater confidence in the launch of belVita in China, because the guy who's launching it actually came out of Europe, where it was a fabulous success. And so, as we look at each of our businesses, the ability to transfer that knowledge is a key driver, not only of the learning, but also of some of the material. So, I think you'll continue to see us expanding our proven platforms more aggressively as a result of the new model, as well as capturing the learning from one market to the other. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank. Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, everybody. Dexter Congbalay - Vice President- Investor Relations : Hey, Eric. Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: A couple of questions. I guess, let's talk about the top-line. Maybe a little bit of a follow-up to Bryan's question. I think, Irene, that you had said or you had thought that the categories were kind of strengthening. And yet, the data that you show basically says, in sales, total snacks was up 4.4% in the first quarter, and for the year, or year-to-date, it's up 4.5%. And I assume that there's a fair amount of FX-led pricing going on. So, from a volume/mix perspective, do you still feel that the categories globally are strengthening? Or just maybe you could kind of give a sense there. And then I have a follow-up. Irene Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. No, as you can see from our overall results, Eric, the big driver of our revenue is, in fact, pricing and mix. And so, there's no question that volume is not where we need it to be. A big part of the investment that we'll be making, that we've begun to make in the second quarter and we'll be making through the balance of this year is designed to get our volume momentum back. So we expect that \u2013 we had told you that we expected vol/mix in the second quarter to be weak because of the Easter shift, as well as the elasticities. We should start to see that strengthen in the back half the year. Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then, Brian, I guess, can you give some updates on like CapEx, not just this year, but next year? The $1.8 billion that I think you threw out at CAGNY kind of surprised me. And the roughly $1 billion dollars of cash cost for the latest restructuring this year, next year. Are those still like good numbers, or as you've kind of gotten more experienced within Mondelez, are there any changes maybe for the \u2013 on the right side of it? Brian Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Look, I think we said 5% is sort of the target in the mid-term, given all of the things we're doing with the plants. That's really what the $1.8 billion is. I think as we \u2013 one of the things you saw probably in the deck is that, as we take coffee out that takes about $100 million out. So, the number for the year is still about $1.7 billion. As I've said, and I think I've said at CAGNY, I mean, this should be the peak year, as a percentage of revenue and on a dollar basis. And we'll start moving down as we move through the execution of the supply chain reinvention activity. So, no real change to that. I think we're being thoughtful. We're adjusting that based on some of the volume trends that you've seen. In terms of capacity that drives volume, versus investment in productivity programs that may be accelerating some of the productivity opportunities. And that's part of what I think you see play out. On the restructuring, no real change. We're progressing through that, and that's part of the \u2013 obviously driving some of the overhead savings that you're seeing in the results. And this is, on the restructuring from a cash standpoint, this is the big year as well. 2015 will be the biggest year. Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I thought it was \u2013 or the last time I asked or we checked, it was like $1 billion this year, or $1 billion next year, and then like $500 million in cash, in 2017. Has that changed a bit? Brian Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It'll be bigger this year, and come down next year. Yeah. Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Okay. Thank you. I'll pass it on. Brian Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll of Citi Research. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you, and good morning. Irene Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, David. Dexter Congbalay - Vice President- Investor Relations : Hey, David. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Can you talk a little bit about the pricing dynamic in Latin America? And I think pricing here came in well above the foreign exchange effect. This is unusual, at least from my point of view, from a lot of other companies. We would normally see pricing up to some degree, but it usually never matches the percentages that you see on FX in the impact, because most companies are trying to offset the margin impacts rather than the revenue impacts. Are you getting actual pricing that's just net positive to the margin structure in Latin America? Irene Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : The answer is yes. There is a timing impact, as you would imagine, although I would say we've gotten a lot better about executing pricing actions. We used to price once a year. Now we're pricing far more frequently, particularly in a number of the more volatile markets. But for the most part, we are pricing to recover our cost increases, and you're seeing that play through in the margins, as well as in the revenue. Brian Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And you would see other quarters where it would be the other way and you gotta catch up. That's really the dynamic. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. So maybe that's what I'm missing here. Part of this is a catch-up, versus prior quarters where it just wasn't as good. Would you think that this kind of dynamic that we see today in the second quarter, does it continue in the back half? Irene Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, again, I think you're going to continue to see us in a number of the markets, particularly Venezuela and Argentina, you're going to see us continue to try to keep pace with the inflationary impact. In markets like Brazil, we want to just manage the impact of the pricing that we have taken year-to-date, because we still have some sizable price gaps, and we've had a decelerating impact, as I mentioned, on our category performance. So, we're going to continue to monitor that and to make sure we're investing adequately behind the franchises. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): I had a couple little ones here. On FX, your outlook is unchanged, but, of course, you had the coffee divestiture, which was European, et cetera. So, why doesn't the FX change post the coffee divestiture? And, also, same question kind of on the tax rate. Why doesn't the tax rate change post the divestiture of this big European business? Brian Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, the euro has come down a bit, I think is the offset to the coffee change. That's the dynamic that's playing out. And what was your second question again, David? I'm sorry. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): So the tax rate, you've got this big divestiture and the tax rate doesn't change, but I feel like it perhaps should. Because as you take this big piece out, the residual mix of businesses should cause a change in tax rates as you add them all together. So maybe it's a 2016 or 2017 question. I don't know how, but I feel as if it's something potentially important. Brian Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. I mean, given the exposures of where the coffee business is, I mean, it would have a lower tax rate. So, when you take that out, you would expect it to go up a little bit. What we've got playing out in this outlook is really some specific countries where statutory rates have moved and some discrete items that we see in front of us. So, that's what's keeping it low. Over the longer-term, we'll give you visibility to that as we move through the year. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Last question; is there a synergy number that you can give us for the new coffee joint venture? Is it significant? And what's the rate of growth that you would expect on this joint venture line going forward? Brian Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I mean, it's a private company. And with our partners, we're not going to disclose a lot about that. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard of Bernstein. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, there. Can I ask about India to begin with? You didn't quantify just how much sales were down. I'm assuming that they were down perhaps this time around. And maybe just a little bit of color on what's happening out there and when it might get back into recovery. And then as a quick follow-up, the margin outlook in EEMEA, it was down 120 basis points this quarter. When do you expect the pricing to adjust so that that might turn itself around? Thank you. Irene Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, EEMEA, a simple answer is, there has been some dislocation with the rapid devaluation of the currencies, and we should start to see that moderate as the year progresses. So that's an easy one. Let's come back to the India question. Let me clarify that. India is growing. It's just growing at a slower rate than it had been. So I want to be very clear. It's not a problem. It's just we'd like to see it get back up to the high single digit, double digit rates that it had been growing at since we acquired the Cadbury business. There's no question that the actions that we took in response to the devaluation of the rupee as well as the impact of higher cocoa costs has impacted the market. We not only have seen our gaps widen, but we also have crossed some critical price thresholds. And so the intent of our investments back in the chocolate category in India are designed to help to mitigate some of that and help the Indian consumer over the hump. We've also taken a number of steps to help our price pack architecture in the market so that we are covering various points on the price spectrum. So net-net, India continues to be a market of great importance and interest to us. It's got a nice, growing middle class, very low per capita consumption of chocolate, and we expect it to be a growth engine for the future. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on. Brian Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Alexia. Operator : Our final question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow of Bank of Montreal. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you very much for letting me have my question. Let me just ask more of a qualitative question. It was asked a little bit, but just trying to get into this idea of the 15% to 16% margins. After you achieve the 15% to 16% margins, what are the opportunities within your portfolio? Like how will you direct your efforts to reconfigure your operating margins? Is it more of the same? Is there different facilities? Is it different regions? Is it different products? Can you just give us some qualitative view of where you're going to go strategically after you hit the 15% to 16% margins? Brian Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, I'll give you a little bit of the dynamics and maybe Irene can answer strategically. As we talked about the restructuring supply chain reinvention, I mean that's an activity that will go through 2018. So this is one where 15% to 16% is what we're calling for 2016, but the reality is there will be continued cost opportunities and margin opportunities beyond 2016. As I said earlier, I think we want to maintain the flexibility to balance really growth with the margins that we drive in the business. And being able to re-invest is a \u2013 it's nice that we're really getting that opportunity right now to begin to do that. We expect to do that more. And driving a better balance between top line growth and volume growth, and the quality of that top line, along with higher margins, there's clearly continued opportunity to do that beyond 2015 to 2016. Irene Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : But you know Ken, a lot of the productivity, as we shared with you, a lot of the productivity that we're driving as we speak, the record net productivity that we just delivered in this quarter and for the first half is before the impact of our supply chain reinvention investments, which, as we've shared with you, has a sizable impact on variable costs. In addition, a lot of the tools that are driving that productivity, things like integrated Lean Six Sigma are the tools that will enable us to continue to benefit from productivity as we look ahead. So we've got good tools in place that should become the foundation for the future performance, and gives us great confidence as we look into 2016 and beyond that our margin performance will continue to be quite strong. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Do you think that you will \u2013 it seems like there's a long way before you get to your natural limit on your margins. Is that a fair commentary? Irene Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well I think it's fair to say that we \u2013 we have great visibility to continued improvement in our margins. As we've shared with you, though, we want to continue to make sure as we think about how much of that will drop to the bottom line, it's all predicated on our balance between our top line and our bottom line. And we'll continue to share that with you as we move ahead. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Thank you very much. Dexter Congbalay - Vice President- Investor Relations : Operator, that's our last call. This is Dexter. If you have any questions going forward, happy to take them today over the next few days, and thank you for joining our call. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Some of today's prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. You can find the GAAP-to-non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Irene. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Dexter. Good morning. The third quarter macroenvironment remained challenging. But we continued to drive top-tier margin expansion while delivering solid organic revenue growth. Specifically, organic revenue grew 3.7%, led by our pricing actions to recover commodity- and currency-driven input costs, primarily in high-inflation markets. Adjusted gross margin increased 180 basis points to 39.1%, driven by strong net productivity and the early benefits of improvements in our supply chain. We expanded adjusted operating income margin by 170 basis points to 14.1% while significantly increasing advertising and consumer support. Adjusted EPS was $0.42, flat versus prior year on a constant-currency basis. We delivered strong operating gains. However, as expected, these gains were offset by below-the-line items, including dilution related to the creation of our coffee joint venture, as well as higher taxes. Our performance in the third quarter reflects continued progress in executing our transformation agenda. We further focused our portfolio. In July, we closed on the joint venture to combine our coffee business with D.E Master Blenders to create Jacobs Douwe Egberts, the largest pure-play coffee business in the world. As a result, we received more than $5 billion of cash, including the benefit of currency hedges, and retained a 43.5% interest in the JV. We strengthened our snacks business through two bolt-on acquisitions, including Kinh Do's biscuit business in Vietnam and Enjoy Life Foods, a leader in fast-growing allergen-free snacks in the U.S. We'll look for more opportunities in the future to strengthen our snacks business through additional bolt-on acquisitions like these. We also continued to aggressively reduce costs, to expand margins and provide the fuel to accelerate our growth. In the third quarter, we significantly expanded gross margin by generating net productivity of more than 3% of cost of goods sold, including the benefits from the installation of almost 30 Lines of the Future around the world. In addition, we remain on track to reduce overheads as a percent of revenue by at least 250 basis points between 2013 and 2016, with additional opportunities thereafter. As Brian mentioned at the Barclays conference in September, we're identifying even more indirect cost savings than our original target. This sets up well for continued savings beyond 2016. We're also well on our way to migrating more than 40% of back-office processes in finance, HR, and several other functions to global shared services. For each of these processes, we'll reduce costs, on average, by half, enabling additional savings through and beyond 2018. As these supply chain and overhead cost savings come through the P&L, we'll continue to expand gross and operating margins while stepping up investments to drive growth. We're already beginning to see the benefits of this virtuous cycle. In the third quarter, we increased advertising and consumer support as a percent of revenue by 50 basis points to more than 8.5%. Almost all of our incremental investment was behind our Power Brands in key markets and categories, to backstop our pricing actions, improve our share of voice, and accelerate the global rollout of proven innovation platforms, such as Oreo Thins in North America, base Oreo in Russia, Trident and belVita in China, and Bubbly aerated chocolate in India. In addition, we continue to invest in route-to-market expansion, especially in emerging markets, as we look to strengthen our capabilities and position ourselves to capture more than our fair share of growth as the economies in these markets recover. We're encouraged by this progress and remain committed to our strategy and transformation agenda. As we look ahead, there are three areas where we want to continue to sharpen our focus going forward : on cost savings, growth, and commercial execution. So we're also announcing some important organizational changes this morning. We've seen great benefit in consolidating our cost agenda under Brian Gladden, our CFO, and our growth agenda under our Chief Growth Officer. We now see a similar opportunity to sharpen our global commercial execution by creating a new role of Chief Commercial Officer, or CCO. Today, we're naming Mark Clouse to that position and appointing Tim Cofer, who currently runs our Asia-Pacific business, as Chief Growth Officer. Mark, in his role as CCO, will oversee the execution of the company's growth plan, with oversight over all five geographic regions, as well as the global sales function. This new structure should simplify and accelerate day-to-day P&L decision-making and tradeoffs, while focusing investments in those areas that will best drive profitable growth. Tim, in his role as CGO \u2013 with responsibility for corporate strategy; the global categories; global marketing; and research, development, and quality \u2013 will lead the development of next-generation innovation platforms and new business opportunities to accelerate future growth. Brian, Tim, and Mark, together with our region presidents, Daniel Myers, and our integrated supply chain teams, will work hand in hand to continue to advance our transformation agenda and accelerate growth on both the top and bottom lines. Now let's take a closer look at our top line results. As I said, organic revenue growth was 3.7%. Higher prices contributed 7.4 points, with most of the pricing occurring in emerging markets, as we recovered commodity- and currency-driven input costs to protect profitability. Vol/mix was down 3.7 points, largely due to elasticity in response to new pricing actions in markets like Brazil and Russia, as well as a negative 70 basis point impact resulting from our strategic decisions to improve revenue mix. Year to date, the vol/mix headwind from those decisions was 90 basis points. For the full year, we expect a headwind of up to 100 basis points, as we've shared with you before. Our Power Brands, which now represent nearly 70% of revenue, delivered solid growth of more than 5%. Emerging markets were up over 10%, due to pricing, with the BRIC markets growing mid to high single digits. Developed markets declined 0.5%, largely driven by our actions to improve revenue mix. Turning now to our results by region. As I mentioned earlier, pricing in emerging markets drove our growth this quarter. Latin America was up over 17%, driven by inflationary pricing in Venezuela and Argentina. Brazil was up low to mid-single digits, as we took additional pricing to recover higher input costs resulting from the recent weakening of the real. This pricing, along with softer categories as macroeconomic conditions deteriorated, pressured vol/mix in Brazil. We anticipated these difficult conditions and managed the business accordingly. As a result, we don't expect to have a material inventory destocking risk. Our EEMEA region was up 6%, led primarily by pricing in Russia, in response to the sharp devaluation of the ruble. We responded with a series of pricing actions that led to over 20% growth in Russia this quarter, which was broad-based across most categories. Vol/mix declined, however, as categories slowed in response to higher prices and weakening economic conditions. As in Brazil, we're actively managing our inventory levels and do not expect any material dislocation issues. Asia-Pacific was up 3%, with solid growth in China and Australia, partially offset by weakness in some other markets. China was up mid to high single digits, driven by strong performance in both biscuits and gum. India grew modestly, led by solid chocolate growth, in response to our stepped-up A&C investments. Turning to developed markets, Europe was down 1.6%, largely due to our strategic decisions to improve revenue mix. North America was up modestly, with solid growth in biscuits and candy, partially offset by continued softness in gum. Turning to our categories, year-to-date snacks are up approximately 5%, and about the same amount if you include powdered beverages and cream cheese. Currency-driven pricing remains the key driver of category growth. While our organic snacks growth is about a point below our categories, that's largely related to the 90 basis point impact of our actions to improve revenue mix. Looking at our overall market share, about 45% of our snacks revenues are gaining or holding share. Although we're not satisfied with this result, we're making sequential progress as expected as our competitors price, consumers adjust to higher price points, and we invest some of our cost savings into incremental marketing support. Let's take a closer look at each of our snacks categories. Biscuits grew nearly 6.5% year to date, and we grew about 5.5%, with strong performance in China, Brazil, and Russia. Shares were also strong, with about 60% gaining or holding, including increases in both cookies and crackers in the U.S., as well as share gains in Brazil. Power Brand revenues were up high single digits, led by Oreo, TUC, Club Social, and belVita. The chocolate category increased about 5.5% year to date, while our revenue grew only about 1%. This reflects the fact that we led significant pricing in most markets in response to rising input costs. Recently, competitors have begun to price, and in select markets, like the U.K. and India, we've stepped up A&C support. As a result, we're beginning to see improvements in both revenue growth and share. In fact, in the third quarter, our revenue grew low single digits, up from essentially flat in the first half. Chocolate market share also increased, from about 25% growing or holding in the first half to approximately 30% through September. While share performance remains below what we would like, much of this is due to our revenue mix improvements in Europe, including discontinuing low-margin chocolate product lines. Going forward, we expect share performance to continue to improve, as price gaps narrow and as our A&C investments pay off. The gum and candy category grew nearly 2% year to date. Our revenue was up 5%, with both gum and candy growing mid-single digits, led by growth of gum in China, and candy in the U.S. So, as you can see, we delivered solid top-line growth in the quarter, and share has begun to improve in response to increased marketing support in a number of key markets and categories. Let me now turn it over to Brian, who will provide an update on our third quarter margin expansion and earnings growth. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Irene, and good morning. We delivered strong margin expansion in the third quarter by executing our transformation agenda in a challenging macroeconomic and consumer environment. Starting with slide 9, you can see that adjusted gross margin increased 180 basis points to 39.1%. This expansion was driven by another quarter of net productivity of more than 3% of COGS. As expected, mark-to-market of commodity and currency hedging contracts was a 40 basis point headwind in the quarter, largely due to cycling of a gain in the prior-year quarter. Year to date, mark to market is a 20 basis point benefit. Adjusted OI margin grew 170 basis points to 14.1%. We continue to drive down overheads and offset stranded costs from the coffee transaction by leveraging zero-based budgeting and other cost-saving tools. These overhead savings, as well as lower supply chain costs, allowed us to continue to accelerate some A&C investments in a number of key markets and categories in the quarter to support our pricing actions and innovation platform launches, as well as to stimulate category growth and improve share performance. As Irene mentioned, we stepped up A&C by 50 basis points to more than 8.5% of revenue. Based on recent results, our investments are beginning to pay off. We're seeing improvements in our growth and share performance in chocolate in both Europe and India, and in addition our biscuits revenue in North America has begun to accelerate behind our increased marketing support and innovation. Now let's look at margin improvement by region. As you can see on slide 10, our cost reduction efforts have driven improvement in adjusted OI margins across all of our regions. In North America, OI margin was up 130 basis points, largely driven by strong gross margin expansion, which more than offset increased A&C investment. In Europe, margin increased 270 basis points, as strong net productivity and lower overheads more than offset increased A&C in that market. In Latin America, margin grew 60 basis points, driven by lower overheads. And in Asia-Pacific and EEMEA, margins increased 380 and 210 basis points, respectively, as strong gross margin expansion more than offset higher A&C support. . Adjusted EPS was $0.42, flat versus the prior year on a constant-currency basis. We delivered strong operating gains of $0.08, which includes a $0.01 benefit from acquisitions and a $0.02 headwind from mark to market as we lapped a gain in the prior-year quarter. Below the operating line, lower interest expense and the benefit from a lower share count offset a $0.04 headwind from taxes, as we cycled an unusually low effective tax rate in the prior-year quarter. Additionally, and as you know, we're now reporting our portion of the JDE's net income using the equity method below the line. While we don't expect to provide much regular color on the results of JDE, as it's a private company, we've said it would initially be dilutive, and it was this quarter. Some of this is driven by the timing of the close, and some is simply driven by the timing of integration and synergy execution. Prior to the closing of the JV, both partners increased shipments to the trade as a precautionary measure to ensure a smooth transition for customers, which affected JDE's third quarter revenue. While we continue to expect the EPS dilution for the next few quarters, we remain confident in the potential of the business and believe it will create significant value for both shareholders. Turning to return of capital, on slide 12 you can see so far this year we've returned $3.8 billion of capital to our shareholders. In addition to paying more than $700 million in dividends, we purchased $3.1 billion of stock, or nearly 80 million shares at an average price of just under $39 a share. In Q3 we bought back a little over $900 million of stock as we opportunistically stepped up our buyback activity, given how our stock traded during the quarter. This means that we have about $6 billion remaining under the current share repurchase authorization that goes through 2018. Let's turn to our outlook. Given our solid third quarter results, we're reaffirming our 2015 outlook and our 2016 adjusted OI margin target of 15% to 16%. For 2015, we still expect organic net revenue growth of at least 3%. On a reported basis, currency remains a sizable headwind. Based on current spot rates, we estimate currency to have a negative 13 percentage point impact for the year, a little more than our previous estimate of a 12-point impact. We continue to expect to deliver adjusted OI margin of approximately 14%, excluding 20 to 30 basis points of stranded overhead costs from the coffee transaction. We made good progress in offsetting most of the stranded costs in the quarter and expect to fully offset them by the end of the year. We continue to anticipate double-digit adjusted EPS growth on a constant-currency basis for the full year. Based on current spot rates, we estimate a negative currency impact of $0.33, the same as our previous estimate. With respect to free cash flow excluding items, we still expect it to be approximately $1 billion for the year. For modeling purposes, we've reduced our interest expense assumption to approximately $700 million, down from $750 million. We maintained our tax rate guidance in the low 20%s for 2015. And while we continue to be opportunistic with our share buyback program, we anticipate repurchasing around $500 million of our shares in the fourth quarter. In this scenario, we would still have approximately $700 million remaining in coffee transaction proceeds to spend in the first half of next year. So to wrap up, we delivered another solid quarter in a volatile and challenging macroeconomic environment. We're continuing to make excellent progress against our transformation agenda by focusing our portfolio on snacks and aggressively reducing our supply chain and overhead costs. This has enabled us to expand operating margins in each region while also fueling incremental investments behind our Power Brands and innovation platforms to drive revenue growth and improve market share in our key markets and categories. As a result, we remain on track to deliver our 2015 outlook, as well as our 2016 margin target of 15% to 16%. As the world's leading snacking company, we're one of few industry players with the assets, leadership, and capabilities to deliver strong top and bottom line growth over the long term. With that, let's open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: \u2013 everybody. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Andrew. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Andrew. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Two questions for me if I could. First off, with margins continuing to come through as you expect, seems like the key question will be around really the mix between volume and price. And I guess I thought we'd at least start to see volume get sequentially better for the company, particularly with price gaps starting to narrow. But volume got a bit weaker sequentially, and we got more price than we'd modeled. And I guess European volume was still pretty weak despite a very easy year-ago comp. So maybe first could you just update us on the \u2013 again, a little bit more color on the price gap situation in Europe chocolate, and if you need to reassess the strategy there, like perhaps what you did in the U.K. Or have you seen enough movement in pricing in earnest that you kind of feel like you're going to see these price gaps narrow for real? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Andrew, there's no question we are seeing our price gaps narrow, as we had expected. And as we said in our Q2 call, we do expect vol/mix to improve sequentially in the second half. Our underlying business is performing quite well. We're seeing some very encouraging signs as we look at chocolate in the EU, we look at biscuits in North America, we look at chocolate in India, for example. The factor that really impacted Q3 \u2013 there's really two. The first is that we did have to take some additional pricing in markets like Brazil and Russia in response to the significant devaluations of their currencies. And that just created another elasticity impact, which just put a little bit more pressure \u2013 again, in the near term \u2013 on vol/mix. And then the second is just, for the luck of the draw, we had a big heat wave this summer in Continental Europe, and that did have an impact on our chocolate business, so that as we were starting to see those gaps close and make the necessary investments, the impact of those investments just took a little bit longer than we anticipated. Net-net, we would expect that we should see continued revenue growth and share improvement as we make the investments focused in the key areas I've described and as we exit the year. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Okay, thank you for that. And then, Brian, with respect to some of the supply chain work that you're doing, is there a way to give us, directionally even, a sense of how much that contributed to 3Q gross margins \u2013 and I guess more importantly how that now starts to build as we go forward into 2016? Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Andrew, as we've been saying, it clearly is still early days on the supply chain reinvention work and the impact of the Lines of the Future. I would say the third quarter, we've begun to see some of that, but the majority of the \u2013 we talked about 3%-plus net productivity on COGS in the quarter. The majority of that's still driven by base productivity programs. So this is still one where I think, as we've been saying, the majority of the supply chain benefits and all the Lines of the Future that we've been investing in, as you work your way through startup costs and all the things that go with bringing those lines up, it does take some time, and it's really going to be a 2016 dynamic where you start to see some of those benefits. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi, thank you. This will just be kind of a follow-up to Andrew's question. When I looked at Nestle's results, I thought I saw that they had chosen to not price in line with currency in chocolate in Brazil. And given how big of a competitor they are in Latin American markets in general, I was just wondering if this latest price increase that you took, is that one of the things that you might have to reassess? And are there any other, I guess any other Latin American markets where you see the same dynamic? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, first of all, Rob, I would say that our performance in Brazil has been quite strong in the face of some really significant macroeconomic challenges. We've actually grown or held share in all of our categories there. So, as we think about the challenges in chocolate, in many respects, 40% of our chocolate business is in Europe, and I've been clear about what some of the issues were there. Nestle did say in their call, as you said, that they did not price, but the facts are, as you start to look at individual SKUs, we are seeing movement. So we continue to monitor each of these key categories in our key markets very carefully, and if we need to continue to supplement some of our investments in these markets, as we did in the U.K. and to some extent in Germany, we will continue to do that. But for now Brazil actually has held up remarkably well, growing in the low to mid-single digits in the face of some very significant challenges. But, most importantly, we are holding or growing our shares in all of our categories there. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And, Rob, I would just say, you look at the currency in Brazil, the third quarter currency, it's up almost 60% year over year. And year to date, it's up 35%. I mean, it's dramatic. The only other point I'd make, Rob, is just, this is also one of the markets where we've put additional A&C, as we've seen the opportunity to reinvest in the growth side of the business. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah, and I can clearly see the good work that you've done in those markets, and you can see it in your results. Just broader speaking, though, if you look at your peers, they aren't taking pricing up to that degree in emerging markets, just in general. So I guess I would hate to see you set yourselves up for setting up price gaps that are bigger than you would hope for, and that was the reason for the comment. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, but again, Rob, we've got some very clear benchmarks with respect to those gaps. We are seeing them close around the world. The speed at which they close varies a little bit market to market, but I'm quite confident that we are managing the right balance between the margin expansion and driving growth, for today and for the future. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel. Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning, Chris. Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Just two quick questions, if I could, please. First would be, just to understand, the incremental investment in A&C has been pretty significant really all through the year. I think you made a comment, Irene, about hitting 8.5% of sales. I had been thinking more like 9%-plus, in terms of where you were headed for. Does that mean you were short this quarter? Or is 8.5% more the right number for where you want to be in terms of A&C investment here in 2015? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, actually, as we've said, Chris, we're going to make steady investments in A&C, as we see the good returns coming from those investments. We're up significantly versus prior year, and we will be for the full year. But we have said that our target for the long term is approximately 10% of revenue, and slowly but surely we're making our way to those levels. But the good news is, we are starting to already see the impact of the investments as a means of backstopping pricing and continuing to build our brand equity. So it's up quite significantly. It will continue to grow, as we have the affordability and as we see strong returns. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And, Chris, a lot of discipline around tracking ROI around these incremental investments. And some of them, obviously, are going to work and deliver great returns, and some of them that aren't, we're paring those back quickly as we move forward. So a very detailed operating mechanism around those A&C investments. Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's very helpful. And I had just a quick question, if I could, on \u2013 your emerging market sales are very strong in the quarter, and I think you mentioned the BRIC countries being up mid to high single digits in the quarter, meaning you had a little bit of acceleration in other emerging markets. You've talked as well about route-to-market investments. Some of this A&C investment, I assume, is going towards these other markets as well. I just thought I'd get a sense of white space opportunities. Are those in part what's helping drive the better emerging market revenue growth overall? Is that where we're seeing the benefit coming through in the top line? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Actually, not yet, Chris. The route-to-market investments we're making today are high-return opportunities to expand distribution on proven categories and brands in key markets. And so we've talked about the investments we're making behind merchandising support, things like visi-coolers that help us in markets like India, improving our penetration in rural India. As we look at China, we're continuing to expand our traditional trade penetration in tier 1 and tier 2 cities and then expanding into tier 3 and tier 4 cities. Brazil, we continue to see the North/Northeast as a ripe area for investment. So these are near-in, high payback kinds of route-to-market investments. That said, we still see white-space opportunities for us to take our categories to new markets. And obviously gum in China is a great example, biscuits in India, for example. But as we look at our emerging markets, virtually all of them are one- or two-category markets. And it would be our expectation over time that we will be able to see all of our categories in each of our key markets, and that's what gives us great confidence as we think about the runway of growth opportunities. Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, good morning, everyone. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning, Bryan. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Had just a question on Mark Clouse's new role as Chief Commercial Officer. And just wanted a little bit more color on two areas. One is, does it also imply or come with the creation of, like, a global sales force? Or will Mark be interacting with sales forces at the regional level? And then, second, one of the things that is cited in the press release is a focus on day-to-day P&L decision-making, and I guess I kind of read that as maybe a sharper focus on trade promotion spending and a way to kind of make it more efficient. So is that a correct read on one of the sort of key areas that you expect to see some focus on? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Absolutely, Bryan. That's exactly the way to read it. This is not about a global sales consolidation. We believe very strongly that the right aggregation needs to be at the regional level, but think of it more as a center of excellence, the opportunity to take best practices from one market to another. So in addition to making sure that the terrific growth agenda that Mark and his team laid out is now executed through our regions, we do see additional opportunities to capture best practices in terms of execution at point of sale, as well as building our capabilities in areas like trade optimization, as you suggest. So all of those things, I believe, will just help to further strengthen what has been very strong commercial execution. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And in terms of the opportunity within trade, your trade spend, is it a major opportunity just to improve the efficiency there? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We do see that as a big opportunity, and I think you'll be hearing more about that as time goes on. Obviously, the challenge in any of those decisions is getting the right balance between revenue and trade spending. Our goal is to try to find a way to make the dollars we're spending work harder for us. But that is a focus, and we do see that as an opportunity. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank. Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Eric. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Eric. Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I just have a couple of questions. I guess first, Brian, on the JV, it sounded like you \u2013 were you signaling that that might be more dilutive than you had initially forecast based on the \u2013 what sounds like a little bit of trade-loading in that business, or other developments? Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We're not really updating a view for ongoing dilution or accretion. We're only three months into the JV. We don't really have any new information that would lead us to have a different view on where we see that over a long period of time. We didn't really expect much benefit from the JV as you look at the first couple quarters here. I think we do expect that their performance will improve into the fourth quarter, I'd say modestly, and then \u2013 and we move into 2016, obviously quite a bit as they execute on the integration and synergy plans. So, yeah, I mean, there clearly were specific actions that we took, both partners, heading into the close of the joint venture that moved more inventory into the trade. That was intentional to really create a buffer and allow us to feel confident that we could manage through the startup of the new systems and order management and all that went with that, the closing process. But nothing new, Eric, in terms of our view of the opportunity here and the accretion dilution at this point. Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for that. And then I guess both to Irene and to you, Brian: I guess I'm not exactly \u2013 I guess I'm just a little bit concerned about the volume weakness in the quarter. I mean, it's hard from the outside to figure all this out, but you're spending a ton of capital to put in these highly efficient lines. And these efficient lines, I assume the volume that's going \u2013 that efficiency is a function of the volume that's going through them. And so to the extent that you have other, I guess, cost savings, your decision to price against currency results in weaker volume. It doesn't look like the A&C had a big impact or a positive impact in the quarter. So I guess I'm not really sure what the question is. But I guess I'm a little bit concerned that the decision on FX-related price versus volume weakness makes this whole transformation less powerful because of the fixed-cost absorption not being there. Or maybe you just kind of walk me through why that's not a concern. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I guess, Eric, it's a fair question. But I would tell you that the impact on our volume is uppermost in our mind. But we constantly are evaluating the opportunity to make sure that the margins of these various franchises are attractive enough to warrant the investment, while recognizing that we do create some dislocation. We are leading pricing in most of these markets, and in markets like Russia, for example, we priced three times in the course of this year in response to the significant and rapid devaluation of the ruble. So I feel very good that we are managing to get our margins and protect our margins where they need to be. We are spending back as appropriate. And as I said in response to the earlier question, the aggregate Q3 results mask some of the impact that our spending is having. Take chocolate in Europe, for example. We chose to delay some of that spending until September, rather than into the summer, because of the fact that we had an unusually hot summer. And therefore it's not a surprise that it is just starting to have an impact now. So I think if you start to look at our shares over the last four-week period, we're seeing a very strong response as the categories in a number of these markets are now growing. You think about markets like India, for example. Think about the U.K., our latest 12-week share is up 1.3 points after share losses up until that point. The latest four weeks were up 3.6 points. So we're seeing very strong indications that we're getting a good return on the A&C investments. We are carefully monitoring the volume-pricing relationship, because as you rightly point out, fixed-cost absorption is important to us. But in the face of what we're doing, we're generating net productivity of over 3% of cost of goods sold. So I feel pretty comfortable. The algorithm is working, and we should see improved performance, particularly on shares, as we exit the year. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And, Eric, I would just say as you think about capacity and what we're doing with the supply chain, I mean, we're making real-time adjustments to the capacity, where it goes, how much is volume-related versus in some cases actually closing down capacity sooner, and pulling in some of those programs, given what's going on in the overall market in category growth and volume growth. Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Pass it on. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Thanks. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Matthew. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just two questions. One, just to focus on the EEMEA region. You're obviously taking more pricing and you were able to protect profit dollars year on year this quarter. Just curious if you can give us any guidance of how we should think about your objectives going forward over the next several quarters, given currency macro pressure? Are you going to look to continue to manage toward protecting profit dollars or margins? And then as you move toward a period of fairly easy margin comparisons, is it feasible to expect margins to maybe remain at the kind of low double-digit levels we've seen over the past six months? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So I guess the answer to the first question, Matthew, is that we are seeing the margins improve in response to our pricing actions. We are monitoring the balance very carefully. And as we've said a couple of times, the reaction that we're getting to these pricing actions is pretty much in line with our elasticity assumptions. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I think it's a volatile market, there's no question. So, I mean, as the year has played out, it's played out differently than I think we expected. In some cases we're having to make real-time, in-quarter decisions on pricing. But the agenda, in terms of getting supply chain in the right place, in terms of getting the right products in the market, I mean, those are all the things that we're focused on. We will have a period of some easier compares given we're lapping some of that volatility in the first part of next year. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : But I will say, if you look at markets like Russia, where as I said we priced three times in the course of this year in response to the significant devaluation, our shares are holding up remarkably well. And the reason for that is we have continued to invest in our marketing support, as well as innovation - Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yep. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : \u2013 and that playbook is working well for us around the world. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, great. But fair to say we may still continue to see some of that same level of margin volatility. Or it's hard to say that may not occur? Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's hard to predict what happens in those markets. I think that's the reality. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I think EEMEA, of course, is a massive case in point. So I think the volatility we're seeing there is more extreme than almost anywhere in the world. But, again, our focus is to keep our eyes on the markets, to understand where we stand from a share perspective. And, where we feel the need to supplement our investment, we're making those choices. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And, Irene, could you just talk a little bit about the retail environment in the U.K.? Because there's been some renewed reports suggesting a more aggressive approach by retailers in how they're managing the confectionery category. And I know you've done a lot proactively here, but are you seeing evidence of another wave of this? Or could this be a risk factor looking out over the next year? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I don't think so, Matthew. I mean, the European retail environment is challenging. And I think we have been able to hold our own quite well. They're interested in some of the very same things that our retailers around the world are interested in : what's happening in health and wellness, what's happening on the innovation front. And as long as we continue to drive traffic to their stores, we're an important partner. I'd also tell you that we're increasing our e-commerce business with a number of partners in the U.K. who are very much at the forefront of this click-and-collect initiative that you hear about. And so I think the combination of all of those things gives us great confidence that, as we've now gotten our margins in Europe where we want them to be, that we should see a continued improvement in our overall revenue and share trends. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Thanks, Irene. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard of Bernstein. Alexia J. Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good morning, everyone. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Alexia. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Alexia. Alexia J. Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi there. We've been hearing a little bit about some organizational changes and head count rationalization that may have been put in place over the last few months. Can you comment on the kind of structural changes that you might have put in place? And maybe the impact it may have on head count. I mean, we'll see that in the 10-K when it's published next year. Any order of magnitude would be very helpful. Thank you. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Alexia. Look, I think these are the initiatives we've been talking about for a while when you think about overhead reductions, when you think about what we're doing with ZBB. I mean, the two big ones that we've spent time talking about, clearly a shared services model that we even mentioned in the comments today, where we're moving a significant proportion of our backroom processes around finance and HR and some other functions to outsourced partners in most cases. But that's causing significant changes in our org model and disruption around the world. But that's something that we've spent a lot of time working through a process to execute that, and we feel good about really how that's going. The second one is really moving to the category model, and that's something that we've been doing over the last, frankly, couple years. And really changing the structure of how we run the businesses at the region level and in the countries. So that is work that's been going on and, frankly, will continue as we optimize around a category-driven model. Those are the two big ones, and not really providing a lot more detail in terms of specific actions that go behind that. Alexia J. Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Okay, thank you very much. I'll pass it on. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Alexia. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll of Citigroup. David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great. Thank you and good morning. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, David. David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Brian, I think the guidance means that the fourth quarter operating margin is something similar to the third quarter. So maybe just slightly above that 14%, if my updated model here is done correctly and the quick math. And if that's right, then the real question is that, for 2016, you guys reiterated this 15% to 16% margin. I mean, we are here in October, and so I feel like 2016 is a stone's throw away. To go to the top end of that, to go to 16%, I mean, that's almost like 200 basis points \u2013 or rounding here \u2013 200 basis points of improvement to get to that top end. That seems like quite a lot. At this point, kind of given a slow backdrop, Irene, a clear desire by the company to want to keep investing in the business in these white spaces around the world, doesn't that top end seem like a stretch at this point? Is that fair? Or are there some comments that you can provide here? Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, appreciate the question, David. We're obviously not going to provide an outlook for next year at this point. I would tell you your math makes sense as you think about the fourth quarter. I would tell you it's a prudent view of how we think about the fourth quarter, given the volatility that we see in the business, and some of the markets as we've called out. But it also allows us to have some flexibility around what levels we want to reinvest, and add additional A&C to the business, to get that balance between the top line and bottom line, and get some growth back. So we feel great about the progress with supply chain and shared services, as being key elements that are going to provide additional upside as we head into next year. We're at a point where we've seen pretty significant improvement. If you look at year-to-date margin improvements, it gives us confidence that that sort of a jump is reachable. So we're building on the momentum we have this year, and we'll update you on how we think about 2016 as we close out the year. David C. Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Operator : We have time for one more question. Our final question will come from the line of Kenneth Zaslow of BMO Capital Markets. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey, good morning, everyone. Just finishing up on a couple of quick questions. One is Salinas; can you give us an update on that? And how are the other projects of the reconfiguration going in certain areas, Bahrain and around the world? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. So far so good. We announced a $130 million investment last quarter in Salinas. It is one of the key drivers of our improvement in North American margins over time. And so far so good. So, as we said, most of our supply chain investments, as we think about the progress we're making in Bahrain, in China, in Europe, all around the world, we're making some very good progress on the investments that we've made, and they'll be a key driver \u2013 as Brian just said, it'll be a key driver of our performance as we go into 2016, and then into 2017-2018. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And my final question is, on inventory management, I know you guys have changed it over the last couple years. Can you give a little bit more in-depth idea of what has actually changed? Because this seems to be a problem with many other companies, and you guys have obviously navigated quite successfully over the last year, year and a half. And I was just trying to figure out what makes you guys more successful at this? What has changed? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think, Ken, we learned our lesson the hard way. And the facts are, we're not doing anything herculean. We're simply making sure we have the data, and we are looking at it at all levels of the company on a regular basis. And I think what we discovered in markets like China, for example, it's a fairly complex supply chain, and therefore keeping our eye on the pulse of the business is critically important. I referenced Brazil and Russia in my remarks because they're volatile, and it's imperative that we monitor our inventory situation to make sure that we're keeping track of demand. So it's really not rocket science, but I have great confidence that as we continue to experience volatility in this challenging macroenvironment, that we're well-positioned to manage our businesses and continue to deliver our commitments. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We've made investments in IT tools and connectivity with our channel partners and trade partners to give us that real-time visibility, which is something we haven't had, so that's been an important addition to the process. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. I appreciate it. Thank you, guys. Operator : That was our final question. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks. Dexter Congbalay - Vice President- Investor Relations : Hi, this is Dexter. Thanks for everybody for joining. We'll be available for questions later on through the day. And, again, thank you for joining the call. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.",

With that, I'll now turn over the call to Irene. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Dexter, and good morning. Over the past few years, we've laid out our vision to be the best snacking company in the world. Our advantaged platform provides with us the potential to be among the fastest-growing consumer companies, with substantial margin upside and strong EPS growth, while also returning significant cash to our shareholders. Since we began this journey three years ago in the face of a very challenging environment, we've taken several significant actions to further strengthen our advantaged platform and create sustainable value for shareholders. Our strong results in 2015 reflect our continued progress, with the year playing out essentially as we planned, with very strong margin expansion in our developed markets and more growth coming from our emerging markets. In aggregate, we delivered top-tier margin expansion and earnings growth while generating solid organic revenue growth and improved share performance. Specifically, organic net revenue grew 3.7%, driven by our pricing actions to recover higher commodity- and currency-driven input costs. As Brian will cover in detail shortly, we're deconsolidating our Venezuela operations, and this will have a material impact on our recent organic net revenue growth, as it does to our global category growth. Adjusted gross margin increased 230 basis points to 38.9%, fueled by world-class net productivity. We expanded adjusted operating income margin by 170 basis points to 13.7% while continuing to build our advantaged platform through increased advertising and consumer support. And, finally, adjusted EPS increased 19% on a constant-currency basis, driven by strong operating gains. These results reflect the solid execution of our transformation agenda. First, we further focused our portfolio in our advantaged snacks categories. We combined our coffee business with D.E Master Blenders to create Jacobs Douwe Egberts, the largest pure-play coffee business in the world. And the proposed current transaction should further enhance our position in the global coffee category. We also strengthened our snacks portfolio by acquiring and integrating Kinh Do's biscuit business in Vietnam and Enjoy Life Foods, a leader in the fast-growing free-from snacks in the U.S. Second, we continue to aggressively reduce costs. We're now beginning to see the benefits of our supply chain reinvention as we upgrade our manufacturing network and install more efficient and more flexible Lines of the Future. For the year, we delivered net productivity of more than 3.5% of cost of goods sold, or nearly $700 million. That's world-class and another record year. We also reduced overheads by leveraging zero-based budgeting and other tools, and we're beginning to institutionalize our approach to cost management. These savings enabled us to expand margins and provide the necessary fuel to accelerate growth. During the year, we stepped up A&C investment behind our Power Brands and innovation platforms. This enabled us to continue to strengthen brand equities and backstop some of our pricing actions. On the top line, as we made these investments, we've seen improvement in our volume trends, revenue growth, and market share performance as the year progressed. We actively monitored the payback of these investments, and we'll continue to proactively adjust our spending based on actual returns. On the bottom line, by pricing to recover input cost inflation, we've protected profitability, allowing our net productivity gains to flow through to gross margin. In short, like many smart companies, we're selectively investing through the downturn in emerging markets, with continued investments in A&C and route to market so we can benefit disproportionately as these markets recover. Finally, we continue to strengthen our financial profile. We generated strong free cash flow, lowered our cost of debt, and returned $4.6 billion to our shareholders. So, as you can see, we made good progress on many fronts this year. I'm indebted to our colleagues around the world for their unwavering dedication, hard work and commitment to delivering these results, especially in the face of such massive change. With that as background, let's take a closer look at our 2015 top line results. For the full year, organic net revenue growth was 3.7%. This included a 90 basis point headwind related to our strategic actions to improve revenue mix. As expected, higher prices were the key driver, contributing about 7 percentage points of growth. While we fully expected significant pricing this year, the impact of the strengthening dollar on inflation in emerging markets, especially in the second half, forced us to price even more. While this helped protect margins, it also tempered our vol/mix improvement. As Brian will discuss in a moment, our organic revenue growth \u2013 as I said, it adjusted for the deconsolidation of Venezuela \u2013 was 1.4%. We're especially pleased that our Power Brands grew more than 5%, well above the rate of the overall company, as a result of targeted A&C support. As expected, developed markets, which comprised about 60% of our revenue, declined less than a percent, as we focused our efforts on cost reduction in this slower-growth environment. Emerging markets grew double digits, as we took a more balanced approach by reducing costs and stepping up investment in our brands and capabilities. This allowed us to protect our leading share positions in the near term while remaining ready to capitalize on their long-term potential. Turning now to our results by region. While pricing was the main driver of our revenue growth, most of the pricing occurred in Latin America and EEMEA. Full the full year, Latin America was up nearly 20%, driven by pricing in response to currency-driven inflation, especially in Venezuela. Excluding Venezuela, Latin America was up almost 7%. Brazil was up mid-single digits, as we priced to recover input cost inflation driven by the weakening real. Oreo continued its strong momentum behind increased A&C investment. However, growth in the second half slowed to low single digits as the macro-environment there deteriorated. Looking ahead, we do not expect conditions to improve in Brazil in the near term, and our forecast reflects this. EEMEA was up 6%, driven primarily by pricing in Russia and Ukraine in response to the sharp devaluation of each country's currency. Russia grew high teens for the year, driven by strong growth across all categories, including our largest one, chocolate. Alpen Gold led the way in chocolate, while biscuit growth was fueled by the successful launch of Oreo. However, as in Brazil, volumes fell in the second half as categories slowed in response to weakening economic conditions and price elasticity. Asia Pacific was up about 2%, with solid growth in China, partially offset by weakness in some other markets. For the full year, China was up high single digits, driven by strong vol/mix in both biscuits and gum. belVita breakfast biscuits got off to a strong start, Oreo Thins continue to perform well behind distribution gains, while Stride gum was up high teens. However, growth slowed in the fourth quarter, reflecting the overall economy. As a result, we remain cautious in our China forecast for 2016. India increased modestly, but we're pleased that chocolate grew solidly in the second half in response to stepped-up A&C investments. Cadbury Dairy Milk was up high single digits, and Bubbly is off to a strong start. In addition, Asia's growth was tempered by about a point from SKU reductions, as it was one of the regions most affected by the loss of some short-term Kraft licenses in late 2014. Europe was down about 2%, including a drag of more than a point from strategic actions to improve revenue mix. Vol/mix, while still negative, improved throughout the year, fueled by the benefits of increased A&C and narrowed price gaps. For example, Milka biscuits grew mid-single digits across the region, and U.K. biscuits grew mid-teens, fueled in part by our latest innovation, Ritz Crisp & Thin. North America was up about 1%, with biscuits growth accelerating in the second half behind increased A&C and innovation, including Oreo Thins and belVita Bites. Importantly, vol/mix drove this acceleration. Turning now to our categories. For the full year, our snacks categories were up about 5.5% and about the same if you include powdered beverages and cream cheese. As with our revenue, pricing was the key driver, as volumes remained challenged. Our organic growth was about a point and a half below our categories. That was largely related to the 90 basis point impact of our strategic actions to improve revenue mix, as well as the price elasticity we experienced earlier in the year. Overall, more than 55% of our snacks revenue gained or held share, with solid performance across each category. Let's take a closer look. The biscuits category was up about 7%, and our revenue was up about 6.5%, with strong performances in China, Brazil and Russia. About 60% of our revenue gained or held share, including increases in both cookies and crackers in the U.S., as well as solid share gains in Brazil. The chocolate category increased about 5.5%, while our revenue grew only about 1%. This reflected the fact that we were the first to price in most of our markets. But as I said earlier, this was essential to protecting the health of our franchises. As expected, our performance improved in the second half, as price gaps narrowed and as we increased A&C support in key markets. As a result, market share steadily improved, with half of our chocolate revenue gaining or holding share for the full year. That's up from about 25% in the first half. Lastly, the gum and candy category increased nearly 2%. Our revenue grew 4%, with both gum and candy up low to mid-single digits. Halls grew mid-single digits, driven by strong support behind the new Halls Air campaign that's now been rolled out across Europe, North America, and select markets in AP and EEMEA. Finally, consistent with our plans, we increased A&C support behind high-return marketing initiatives to accelerate revenue growth and drive share. As you can see on slide 8, our organic growth accelerated sequentially as the year progressed, while our share performance was strongest in the fourth quarter. Importantly, we delivered this improvement while significantly expanding adjusted operating income margin, a true virtuous cycle. In sum, we're pleased with our overall financial performance in 2015, as well as with the excellent progress we made in the transformation. As a result, we believe we're well-positioned to deliver strong results again in 2016. Let me now turn it over to Brian, who'll provide details on our 2015 margin performance and earnings growth, as well as on our 2016 outlook. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Irene, and good morning. Starting with slide 9, you can see that for the year, adjusted gross margin expanded 230 basis points to about 39%. As Irene mentioned earlier, strong net productivity was the key driver for this improvement. We're now beginning to see the early benefits from our upgraded supply chain network, including the installation of our highly efficient Lines of the Future. For the year, mark-to-market of commodity and currency hedging contracts was a 40 basis point benefit. We also delivered another year of strong adjusted OI margin expansion, up 170 basis points to 13.7%, while increasing our growth investments significantly. We continued to drive down overhead costs as a percentage of revenue, leveraging ZBB to identify areas of opportunity and capture the savings. These approaches are now the way we work and will continue to deliver benefits for us as we move forward. For the year, A&C spending was nearly 9% of revenue, up about 60 basis points. Most of the step-up was in the second half, including a significant increase in the fourth quarter. As Irene discussed earlier, these investments helped us accelerate organic revenue growth and improved our share performance as the year progressed. We're continuing to prioritize our spending to generate the best overall returns. Now let's look at margin by region. As you can see on slide 9, developed markets drove most of the margin expansion, with North America up 230 basis points and Europe up 190. In both regions, strong net productivity drove significant gross margin expansion, and overheads were down as well. In Latin America, OI margin decreased 70 basis points, largely as a result of cycling the benefit from value-added tax-related settlements in the prior year, while the weakening macro-environment also pressured vol/mix. But in EEMEA and AP, OI margin increased 100 and 150 basis points, respectively. In both regions, gross margin expansion and lower overheads more than offset increased A&C. Turning to EPS, adjusted EPS was $1.75 for the year, up 19% on a constant-currency basis. Strong operating gains of $0.22 drove the increase, and the year-over-year change in mark-to-market added $0.06. Below the operating income line, lower interest expense and the benefit from a lower share count more than offset the headwind from higher taxes and dilution from the coffee transaction that closed in July. Including an unfavorable currency translation impact of $0.33, adjusted EPS was flat. As you can see on slide 13, over the past three years we've returned more than $11 billion of capital to our shareholders, including nearly $3 billion in dividends and more than $8 billion in share repurchases. For 2015, we accelerated this activity by returning $4.6 billion. This included $1 billion in dividends, as well as buying back $3.6 billion of stock, or roughly 92 million shares at an average price of $39.43 per share. As we exited the year, we had about $5.5 billion remaining under the current buyback authorization that goes through 2018. Before turning to our 2016 outlook, let me update you on the change we're making in our accounting treatment for Venezuela. As you saw in our press release today, effective at the end of the fourth quarter, we deconsolidated our Venezuela operations and we began to account for our investments in Venezuela using the cost method of accounting in our GAAP financial statements. As a result, we took a one-time accounting charge of $778 million to our fourth quarter 2015 reported results to remove all assets and liabilities of our Venezuelan operations from our balance sheet. On slide 14, we've summarized the impact of deconsolidating Venezuela on our 2015 results. Excluding Venezuela, organic revenue was up 1.4% versus 3.7% including Venezuela. You should also note that removing Venezuela reduces 2015 total category growth to approximately 4%. Our adjusted OI margin excluding Venezuela was 50 basis points lower, as our margins there were higher than our total company average. But the impact on our margin improvement was relatively minor. Excluding Venezuela, we expanded margin 150 basis points versus the 170 basis point increase including Venezuela. Finally, excluding Venezuela reduced our adjusted EPS by $0.10. As we move to our 2016 outlook, please note all of our guidance reflects a 2015 baseline that excludes Venezuela. With that, let's move to our outlook. You'll see that our approach to 2016 is consistent with our 2015 playbook. We continue to target underlying organic revenue growth in line with our categories. This means prudently increasing investments behind our Power Brands and innovation platforms to accelerate revenue growth and gain share while remaining nimble in how and when we deploy A&C resources across key markets to deliver attractive returns. It also means maintaining our commitment to invest in sales and route-to-market capabilities, so that we're well positioned to capitalize on the long-term growth potential in emerging markets. We also believe we have further opportunities to improve revenue mix by optimizing trade spending and eliminating less profitable SKUs. While we expect this will be a headwind to our reported organic growth, it strengthens the underlying health of our business and is a contributor to our margin improvement. The challenge will be in striking the right balance between competitive position and customer response so that we aren't simply losing revenue and that the impact is net positive on the P&L and the cash flow. Our supply chain reinvention initiatives remain on track, and we'll increasingly benefit from the upgraded infrastructure and capabilities that we're putting in place around the world. We'll continue to reduce overheads by leveraging zero-based budgeting. Incrementally in 2016, we'll begin to realize savings from implementing global shared services, as we eliminate redundant resources and complete process migration work. Finally, we'll continue to look to price to recover currency driven input cost inflation, so that the benefits of our cost reduction initiatives can flow to the bottom line. In sum, we remain focused on reducing costs, expanding margins, and building our advantaged platform to drive top line growth. Our overall approach to our 2016 outlook aligns well with the long-term advantages of our snacking categories. But it's no secret that 2016 is expected to be another challenging year. On slide 16, you can see various issues that are affecting all categories, not just ours. Considering this macroeconomic outlook and the weakening trends we saw during Q4 in several of these markets, we're estimating that global snack category growth market will slow to 3% to 4% this year. That's down from the price-driven growth of about 4% in 2015, excluding Venezuela. While headwinds may affect the near term, we continue to believe in the long-term growth prospects for snacking. Given this backdrop of challenging category dynamics, we expect our 2016 organic revenue growth to be at least 2%. We view this as a prudent top line outlook, given the volatility and recent trends that we're seeing. This includes a 125 basis point headwind from our actions to improve revenue mix by selectively optimizing trade spending and continuing to eliminate less profitable SKUs. As a result of these initiatives, we expect our underlying organic revenue growth to be in line with our forecast of 3% to 4% global category growth. Now let's look at our margin outlook. For 2016, we expect to deliver on our previously committed adjusted OI margin of 15% to 16%. As we said earlier, the deconsolidation of our higher margin business in Venezuela creates an approximately 50 basis point headwind, so we're now likely to be at the lower end of that range. However, our year-over-year margin expansion is expected to be in the range of 200 basis points versus 2015. Said another way, we would have expected to be at the high end of the committed range of 15% to 16% had we not deconsolidated Venezuela. Overall, we expect the drivers of our margin expansion to be similar to last year. Specifically, we expect strong contribution from our supply chain as we continue to drive world-class net productivity levels. We now have approximately 35 state-of-the-art Lines of the Future currently on stream, and we're clearly seeing benefits hitting the P&L as we ramp up production levels. We also expect to continue to reduce overheads as we execute our ZBB program, as we adjust our organization model, and we realize the first savings from migrating back-office processes to global shared services. In 2015, as we began to transition key processes, in many cases we maintained duplicate resourcing until we were confident that the migration was successful. As we ramp up shared services and eliminate these redundant transition costs, we expect savings to build, not only during 2016, but through 2018. We also expect to expand margins by improving our revenue mix. As we execute on this plan, we expect our margins to build as the year progresses. Given the progress we've made, and the clarity of our plans and actions beyond 2016, we're confident in our ability to deliver an adjusted OI margin of 17% to 18% in 2018. On a pro forma basis, excluding Venezuela across all years, the midpoint of this 2018 target equates to an over 400 basis point increase versus 2015, and an almost 700 basis point improvement versus our 2013 baseline. We expect to deliver this margin target by continuing to focus on three things. First, productivity gains from our supply chain. These are funded and in our plan, and we're now expanding and replicating a model that's working. Second, more overhead reductions from lower indirect costs, savings from our global share services, and organizational efficiency. And, third, improved revenue mix. These improvements will be partially offset by increased A&C support as we further align our share of voice with our share of market. Turning to our 2016 EPS outlook, by delivering our organic revenue and margin targets, we expect adjusted EPS to increase at a double-digit rate on a constant-currency basis. We expect this increase to be driven primarily by operating gains. Below the line, while we expect a lower share count to provide a modest benefit, this will likely be offset by the impact of the coffee divestiture, as we had two quarters of fully owned coffee business in full year 2015. So before we take your questions, I'd like to go over a few other items for financial modeling purposes. First, based on current foreign exchange rates, we estimate a currency headwind of approximately 6 percentage points for revenue and approximately $0.13 for EPS. We expect adjusted interest expense to be between $650 million and $675 million, or about the same as 2015. We anticipate our adjusted tax rate will be in the low to mid 20s for 2016, roughly similar to our 2015 rate. And we expect to repurchase about $2 billion of our shares as we deliver on our commitment to spend the remaining coffee transaction proceeds on share buybacks this year. In addition, with respect to JDE, at the back of the presentation is an updated framework to help you estimate its earnings. As you know, JDE is a private company, so we won't share significant detail on their results or projections. JDE management expects performance to be pressured this year, as a result of their strategic actions to better position the company for long-term success. As an investor in JDE, we remain very confident in the long-term potential of the business and believe it will create significant value for its shareholders. In addition, with our participation in the proposed Keurig transaction, we'll be well positioned in the on-demand segment in North America, while further enhancing our global footprint. We'll update you on its impact to our financials after the closing. So to wrap up, we delivered very strong results in 2015. In 2016, we expect macro conditions, especially in emerging markets, to remain difficult and potentially worsen, which will weigh on category and revenue growth. As you might expect, and I think you're hearing from others, we're seeing even more volatility in markets like Brazil, China, and Russia, even as we start our first quarter. As a result, we'll continue focusing on driving strong margin expansion and earnings growth; we'll improve our top line growth, revenue mix, and share performance; and we'll return significant capital to shareholders. We'll talk more about our strong cash flow generation at the upcoming CAGNY conference. We remain very confident in our ability to execute our transformation agenda and deliver an adjusted OI margin target of 17% to 18% in 2018. With our advantaged assets, leadership, and capabilities, we believe we're one of the few industry players with the potential to deliver strong top and bottom line growth over the long term. With that, let's open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Two questions for me, if I could. First, if we exclude Venezuela and strategic actions from both 2015 and 2016, looks like you expect organic net revenue growth to accelerate from, call it 2.2% to a little over 3%, even though, I guess, certain key markets have become a little more difficult heading into 2016, and you have said that you're expecting category growth rates to slow. So I guess I'm trying to get a sense of what the key reasons are to expect this organic growth acceleration? Is it the A&C spend? Is it the share progress? Or what's driving that thought process? And then I've got a follow-up. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, Andrew, I understand the question. There's a lot going on here. But I think it reflects the underlying strength of our business fundamentals. There's no question that our revenue will improve from probably more like about a 2%, 3% underlying to, as you say, about \u2013 a little over 3% this year. That's fueled by strong A&C support, by continued progress in terms of vol/mix, while still improving our margins significantly from about 150 points in 2015 to 200 in 2016, en route to about, as we said, 17% to 18% in 2018, which reflects about a 700 basis point improvement over the five-year period. All of that while still generating double-digit EPS growth and strong cash flow. So we think our underlying business fundamentals are quite solid. There's obviously a lot of moving pieces in this challenging environment. But we're doing what we said we're going to do. We think our underlying business is sound, and we think we're well-positioned to continue to deliver strong growth in a challenging environment. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And, Andrew, it builds on the success. And you can see the trend as we play through the year of - Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yeah. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : \u2013 improving vol/mix, revenue picking up, and clearly share performance improving exiting the year. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it; thanks for that. And then, second, with respect to the 2018 margin target, is this just capturing previously announced plans that you've talked about beyond 2016, or are there incremental actions, I guess, beyond the $1.5 billion target that you've talked about? And, I guess, importantly, what sort of volume picture or outlook is that margin target predicated on? Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, it really is just better line of sight to the actions that we're working now to deliver on this target. Good momentum and cost reduction programs as we execute on those plans, supply chain. As you know, those actions continue even beyond 2016 and 2017, and that will continue to generate benefits. So it's really not anything new or incremental. It's the same playbook. And as we've gotten farther into it, we have much more confidence. So \u2013 and in terms of the overall environment, we're not counting on a return of emerging markets to historical growth rates here. I think we're building on what we see today in the world, and that's the basis for this target. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it; thank you. See you in a couple weeks. Dexter Congbalay - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Andrew. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe of Stifel. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, good morning. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Morning, Chris. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Chris. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Just had two questions as well if I could. The first would be maybe for Brian. As we look at 2016, and we're starting to see some of this in the fourth quarter, this benefit to the gross margin coming through from Lines of the Future and supply chain benefits. Should the gross margin be kind of the main driver of the operating margin expansion for the year? I guess I'm trying to get a sense of how that may play into it, and how input cost inflation will fare in 2016 as well. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, look, I think it'll continue to be both. As we've said, supply chain ramped throughout the year, and we saw the Lines of the Future really generating more benefits in the second half. We said that all year, and that's really how it played out. That will continue and, as you know, I mean, we've now got success in implementing these Lines of the Future in each of the categories, and it's really about taking that model and implementing it in a broader set of assets around the world. So it's something we're very confident in. On indirect costs and shared services, obviously ZBB and attacking some of the key cost packages was probably the lowest hanging fruit and some of the earliest benefits. But things like shared services and some of the organizational efficiency work is really a 2016 driver. So, I guess it's going to continue to be both. As you saw the results in 2015, clearly, it was a strong gross margin driven year. But we also made significant investments in A&C. And that's another dynamic that's going to play out, and that affected SG&A. So it's a little bit of both. And commodity inflation \u2013 look, I think clearly there's some pockets of improved commodity dynamics playing out over the last couple months. But you have to keep in mind that currencies are also a big part of that, and in most cases they're going the other way, especially in some of the key markets for us. So, right now it's not a big driver for us, given that we have to look at both of those together. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And just really kind of related to that, a follow-on to that, if you look at the revenue growth, kind of using the 2% or at least 2% rate of growth, is that \u2013 that's primarily pricing driven? And I know there's a comment about it being pricing driven in the emerging markets. And do you expect volume growth for 2016? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : It'll get better, Chris, but, no, it's still going to be challenged because of the strong impact of pricing. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : But certainly the overall \u2013 we don't anticipate the overall impact of pricing to be as extreme as it was this past year. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you for the time. Dexter Congbalay - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. I'll stick with the two-question pattern if I can. First, when you initially provided guidance years ago for an EBIT margin in 2016 of 15% to 16%, you provided a road map, if you would, as part of a presentation, to get there. I think something similar to what you have on maybe slide 12 today. Is this something you might be willing to do again at some point regarding 2018's margin? I'm just trying to get a better idea of specifically which line items grow when, sense of timing, and so forth. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Ken, we'll talk a bit more about it at CAGNY. I would say it's going to look a lot like the road map you have. And I think the things that we're executing today have resulted in the progress we've made thus far, and they're the same things that are going drive us through 2018. It's, as I said earlier, it's not really a new set of initiatives that are going to get us there. We have increasing confidence, and we're going to execute the things that are in front of us. So we'll show you more of that at CAGNY, but I'm not sure it'll be exciting and new, other than maybe some of the revenue mix activity that we're focused on that we both talked about today. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Well, you'd be surprised by what we find exciting at CAGNY. Dexter Congbalay - Vice President- Investor Relations : We'll do our best. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then one quick one from me on Europe. If I recall, one of the reasons why 3Q was a little bit weak was because of hot weather, which I think hurt you and some of your peers as well. Maybe it was just my model, but was Europe a little bit more sluggish versus what you expected this quarter? We had thought that maybe volumes would repeat a little bit just given that the weather had normalized a little? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, we actually are pleased with the progression that we've seen in Europe, Ken. We did invest \u2013 as we got out of the hot weather \u2013 we did invest particularly behind chocolate as the year ended. And as a result of that, our revenue is still down, but the underlying growth was modestly higher. If you recall, Europe is the region that experienced the greatest impact of our strategic actions. It hit us for about 135 bips, and so - Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : In the quarter. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : \u2013 in Q4. So, the aggregate revenue in the fourth quarter for Europe was down about 1.1%; it was almost entirely fueled by these strategic actions. We're very pleased to see our share trends improving, particularly in chocolate, which was the hardest hit because of pricing actions, especially in the U.K. and Germany, as well as we saw improvement in biscuits in France. At the same time, we were driving significant margin expansion, up over 200 bps for the year. So, we're very pleased with the exiting position of Europe. I think they are well positioned from a margin and a profitability perspective now to grow off of that base. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you very much. Dexter Congbalay - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Ken. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Spillane of Bank of America. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, good morning, everyone. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Brian. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I've got two questions, both related to organic sales growth. And the first one is just in terms of the guidance for 2016, just want to clarify, the 2% growth includes 125 basis point drag from the vol/mix impact from trade optimization and the SKU reduction. I guess, would the trade optimization \u2013 why isn't there a positive? I guess I kind of read that as being that there'd be less trade spending, and so there should be revenue lift from that. So, can you just clarify why it would be like a net negative when there should be, I would have sensed, maybe some net price realization in there? Is it because the SKU reduction is so much bigger, or am I just misunderstanding? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, you're right. It's partly because there's a volume impact as we take these actions. In the case of the pruning, it's about shelf space. In the case of trade optimization, it's about competitive position and customer reaction. And that's why we are so methodical in how we approach this opportunity. So you will ultimately see a net positive as these things play through. You certainly will start to see the benefits in our overall revenue mix, in our profitability, and it's a real enabler to the simplification in our supply chain activity. So you will see the benefits play through, but there is a short-term impact as we take some of these actions. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So it sort of rebases the volume this year, and then there should be a lift off of that in 2017? Is that kind of the way to think about that? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, except that we're taking some additional actions, so essentially it pulls the 90 bips out, and then we're taking out another approximately 125 basis points. The net of that, though, is that we have a healthier franchise, and we think we're well positioned to grow off of that base. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then just \u2013 more the \u2013 between now and 2018, as you think about \u2013 as we think about the increased A&C spend that you're planning, how much of it now is going to seeding sort of white space opportunities, or how much of it is just spending more behind your existing products to support the price increases or to stay in front of consumers in a weak environment? Just trying to understand, at what point do we start to see some lift from taking advantage of the white space opportunities? Is that pushed out a little bit because of the environment? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, it's disproportionately the impact on the base franchise. And, in fact, that's one of the reasons that you saw the sequential improvement as we exited 2015, and we will expect to see continued improvement in 2016. As we've said before, we use investments in white space, we make investments in white spaces somewhat sparingly. We need to establish the franchise, we need to establish a supply chain, often get our manufacturing up and running. And we do have a road map that will get all of our categories to all of our markets over time. But as you think about the investment that we made, for example, in gum in China, that's been a sizable investment. It's paying off quite nicely, but we only do a few of those every year or so. They take a little bit longer to pay back, and particularly in this challenging environment we're being a lot more prudent in terms of those kinds of investments. All that said, as I mentioned in my remarks, smart companies are making the investments in the downturn to be well positioned. And so much of our investment is behind our existing franchises there, and selectively we're looking at white space opportunities. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Thank you. We'll see you down in Florida in a few weeks. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, good morning, folks. Dexter Congbalay - Vice President- Investor Relations : Hey Jason. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you for the question. I want to come back to Spillane's line of questioning. First, congratulations on the market share progression throughout the year. I'm quite intrigued by the trade budget optimization stuff. We're definitely big fans of the opportunity in the industry. We've been somewhat cautious in terms of sizing the prize within the broader snacking space, given the expandable consumption nature of the categories, the impulsive nature. And, as Spillane pointed out, your guidance for this to be a net sales drag implies elasticity on that trade spend reduction greater than one. So can you walk us through a little more detail in terms of scale and scope of how you're attacking this and how you're planning to mitigate the risk of market share losses as competitors step in to fill the void? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, first of all, Jason, the impact of 2016 is going to be much more related to the SKU reduction than trade optimization. As you know, we appointed Mark Clouse to the position of Chief Commercial Officer. He began in that role early this year, and one of his main deliverables is helping us with trade spending optimization. We're just getting started with that work. And, as I mentioned, it's critical that we strike the right balance between our competitive position and our customer response, making sure that it's a net positive impact. So in the near term, particularly in 2016, the bulk of our strategic actions will continue to be focused on eliminating tail brands and less profitable SKUs across each region, which will have a clear impact in the near term, but as I said before, stage us exceptionally well for the long term. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. That's helpful. And then one more quick question and I'll pass it on. Latin America, I know there's some comparison issues on the prior year, but even if we stripped those comparison issues out, it was a particularly soft quarter in terms of the margin profile for the business. Anything unique there? Is there something to extrapolate on the forward, or could you talk us through the details there? Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, look, in the quarter, a lot of the tax benefit that we had in the prior year was in the fourth quarter, the biggest piece of it. So that's probably the biggest dynamic. I would just say, look, we saw, as we said in the comments, a weakening macro in places like Brazil that challenged us a bit. But the biggest one by far, Jason, is the year-over-year tax impact. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you, guys. I'll pass it on. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Dexter Congbalay - Vice President- Investor Relations : Hey, Matthew. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi, thanks. I just had a few follow-ups on the increased A&C spending. First, I guess just from a mathematical standpoint, can you clarify where we are on a pro forma basis in terms of A&C as a percent of sales and whether the deconsolidation means we're now a bit closer to the long-term target and we'll be more focused on optimizing the effectiveness of the spend? And then, anecdotally, now that you've been through a few quarters of beginning to ramp up the level of spending, can you talk at all about where you found the reinvestment to be particularly effective, where you've made the decision to pull back based on the payback you've observed? Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I would say not a whole \u2013 there's not a lot of A&C that was spent in Venezuela. So you can sort of do the math. It does bring the number up a little bit. As we said, we're sort of exiting the year at a 9% sort of run rate. And much of that was ramping as we headed through the year. So it's one of the drivers of the profitability in Venezuela, was the fact that we didn't really have much A&C and we didn't need it in that market. So that's sort of the first part of your question. I'll let Irene take the second. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, we're seeing our spending is up to about 9% of revenue. It's up about 60 bips. And as we look at where we spent it, we're very pleased with the returns that we're getting. So we invested behind biscuits in the U.S., things like Oreo Thins and belVita Bites. We are seeing significant investment year over year in the fourth quarter as we exit the year almost to 3% revenue growth on our biscuit business. I mentioned the impact on EU chocolate, where we invested behind our franchise, in the chocolate franchise, in particular in the U.K. We see continued improvement in Germany despite the fact that that was one of the areas that we chose to take out some of our less profitable volume. In addition, there's a number of markets where we backstopped our pricing actions as we priced in response to currency devaluation, markets like Brazil and Russia. And, again, if you look at our share performance and you look at our margin performance, you see the impact of those investments. So we're going to continue to monitor our performance quite closely, but we want to be sure that we remain nimble in our ability to capture opportunities as we see them and continuing to make the necessary infrastructure investments as well as the markets recover. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. I appreciate it. Thanks, and see you in Florida. Dexter Congbalay - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Matt. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney of Athlos Research. Jonathan P. Feeney - Athlos Research : Good morning. Thanks very much. Just wanted to ask a big-picture question, Irene. If you \u2013 I wonder what makes Mondelez special is this global growth opportunity. And I think as you talk about organic net revenue growth, what people are really sort of thinking is the volume growth opportunity that comes from growing units in all these fast-growing emerging markets. If I look at your four-year growth projection on a volume basis, you're down in what are supposed to be the volume-driving segments of your business, other than Eastern Europe. You're down in Latin America, you're down in Asia Pacific. And while currency's a part of that, macro's a part of it, maybe not your fault, a couple of concerns I have that I'd love your thoughts on. First, when you see \u2013 first, whenever you trade off pricing and volume, that's a lot easier on the margin structure than having to go the other way, and you do eventually need to go the other way on volume growth to sustain any margin expansions. And, secondly, do you worry in some of these markets where you look at an Asia Pacific or Latin America where you're working hard, doing the right thing to maintain that margin structure that's fair to investors, but you're seeing some unit declines. Do you worry that it kind of reverses that networking effect and you get less usage and less households using the products over time in a way that maybe constrains the five- and 10-year growth of the company? So how are you thinking about that balance? Thanks very much. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, thanks. Thank you for that question, Jon. We obviously continue to pay very close attention to the impact of our pricing actions on our volumes. I would remind you that our 2015 vol/mix was down about 3 points. That's about 1 point from Venezuela, about 1 point from the strategic actions we took, and about 1 point of elasticity, which was mostly in the first half. As we started to make the investments, as we locked in our margins and started to make the investments in selected markets in the back half, we saw a very strong improvement in the \u2013 not only in the vol/mix trend, but also in our individual franchise performance. As we look to 2016, our intent again is to make sure that we're continuing to get a positive benefit. We're not going to give you specific guidance for the split between pricing and vol/mix, but as I mentioned, we are expecting pricing to be less of an impact. But it will continue to be pressured as we see inflation in these emerging markets. I think most importantly, what you need to look to for us is to make sure that we're continuing to make the investments necessary to stage our business for the long term as these emerging markets recover. And so it's a constant monitoring of how we're performing, but we think we're getting the right balance here. But it does have \u2013 it has had a short-term impact, but we're quite encouraged by the results we're seeing in the back half of the year, and we've reflected that in our guidance for 2016. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think, Jonathan, we want to be patient. I mean, we believe there is a long-term volume growth dynamic clearly in these emerging markets, and we're making the investments, as Irene said, to ensure that we're positioned for that. But the reality is in the short term, given what's happened with currency and commodities over the last several quarters, it's really driven the dynamic, and it's forced all the pricing through. That's really the driver here. Jonathan P. Feeney - Athlos Research : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Eric Katzman of Deutsche Bank. Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Good morning, everybody. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Eric. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Eric. Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: I guess just a couple of questions. First one on the slide on page 8 that talks about the snack share performance, that's like a running like on a year to date. And wouldn't that imply that the fourth quarter share, given the jump from the third to the fourth quarter, does that imply like the third quarter share improvement was like 65% or 70%? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I'm trying to follow your math here, Eric. There's no question that our share improvement spiked in the fourth quarter. Much of the investment that we made would have hit in the market in the fourth quarter, and you see that play through on the slide. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, slide 8. Yeah, I mean, as you recall, Eric, I mean, these were in the 45% range last time we looked at it, last time we shared it. Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Right. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So big jump in the fourth quarter. And we tend to look at it on a year-to-date basis. Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Okay, okay. And then CapEx has been running like $1.6 billion. Obviously with currency and Venezuela, your dollars, your net income is going be pressured, but given the weaker volume that we've been discussing, can lower CapEx offset that, so maybe free cash flow is not as impaired by some of these developments? Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We'll take you through more detail on cash flow. We had a, I would say, significantly stronger cash flow in 2015 than what we had targeted and shared with you, and we'll update you on that as we talk at CAGNY. I think \u2013 look, we'll continue to monitor the environment. I mean, this volume dynamic is something that's affecting how we're spending CapEx. And we've been, I would say, prudent and thoughtful around where we're spending CapEx. And, at the same time, I also want to say we're sticking to the plan, and the reality is that we still have investments to make as part of executing and building the supply chain capabilities to deliver on the 2018 targets we just talked about. So, as we've said, I think 2015 was the peak in CapEx. It'll get reset a little bit as the revenue comes down with Venezuela, but I think you'll see it come down from here, and as we get toward 2017-2018, be it at the levels we've talked about, closer to the 4% to 4.5% sort of range. Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then if I could just \u2013 last one, bigger-picture question for Irene. I realize that Hershey \u2013 your businesses are quite different. But Hershey's talked about, at least in the U.S., kind of a much more competitive landscape for snacks and confection, different consumer habits maybe affecting overall how the market works, promotion, et cetera. Is part of the SKU cuts across the globe, is part of that a function of \u2013 and I assume these are some of the local brands that you got via Cadbury \u2013 but is it because the consumers' habits are changing and, like meat snacks or something else are more relevant? Or is it something else that's playing out? Thanks. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, we actually feel quite optimistic about the outlook for our snacks in North America. We're seeing good progress, as we said, as we exited the year. The growth rate is in excess of the category growth rates. In fact, we're driving it. We feel very good about our DSD support. We think we're getting good in-store presence; our shares are strong. And we've got a good innovation pipeline. So I think we're well-staged to continue to drive growth in this geography. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think the bigger-picture point on SKUs, SKU reduction, is really about allowing us to focus on the Power Brands and really put more resources against them. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : But, as you said, it was disproportionately in the emerging markets because of some of the acquisitions. So, I mean, our portfolio in North America is a lot more focused on the Power Brands than what we're seeing elsewhere in the world. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yep. Eric R. Katzman - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Pass it on. Dexter Congbalay - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, Eric. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi, thank you. I was watching the stock price, and it's down today. And I don't think it's because of Venezuela because I think that's just an accounting change. But I think people are definitely dialing in on the volume and the guidance, the caution about guidance for top line for next year. And I just want to make sure I got my numbers straight. You're saying that the category growth will probably be 3% to 4%. And if you strip out kind of the SKU rat, and you would be, I guess, 3% plus. So right in that 3% to 4%. Did you consider, though, kind of saying that you would be above the 3% to 4% on a normalized basis? Because I think you are making progress in gaining share. Fourth quarter definitely demonstrates that. And I guess the follow-up is can you commit to 55% of your categories gaining share in 2016, just to kind of hammer home the point? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So the simple point, Rob, is don't forget that we are growing essentially in line with our categories in 2016, while we're expanding margins by about 200 basis points. And I think it's our ability to drive top and bottom line as one of the things that will continue to distinguish us, and so I think we've got good visibility to the places and the programming and the investment levels that we need to continue to protect our shares and ultimately drive our shares. But, as you rightly point out, in that timeframe, I think we're going to continue to see the balance that we've laid out. Longer term, we would expect clearly to deliver revenue growth at or above the rate of our categories. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And, I think, Rob, if we saw more momentum in the markets, and things were a little less volatile, I think we'd have more confidence in being a little more forward-leaning with that, but that's part of what we're thinking here. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): So it's prudent guidance in light of the fact that there's a big margin expansion target going on at the same time? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : As well as a challenging macro environment. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, yeah. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Again, as we told you, we're seeing \u2013 even as we look at this first quarter \u2013 we're seeing continued pressure in a number of the emerging markets. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard of Bernstein. Alexia J. Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good morning, everyone. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Alexia. Alexia J. Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. So two quick ones. On the SKU rationalization, that's been going on for a couple of years now. Can you sort of \u2013 is there an end in sight in terms of when that's going to be impacting your sales? Will it be particularly heavy in the first half of the year; will it ease off in the back half? That's the first question. And then the second one is, excluding the advertising spending as a percent of sales, it looks as though SG&A was fairly flat. Can you quantify the impact of the Latin American VAT hit, and if there were any other things in there that are causing your SG&A not to come down? I know that you've done a lot of cost-cutting, big head count reduction, and moved to a global shared services organization in September. It just surprises me that the SG&A didn't move this quarter. Thank you. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So on the SKU rationalization activities, look, I think this is \u2013 we're making progress. And I guess what I'll commit is we'll give you a bit of an update in CAGNY on that as well. But it is a key lever as we think about the supply chain. And simplifying our product offerings as part of that activity allows us to get at costs and simplify what we're doing in the plants. And there's lots of examples that we can take you through. I would say we're in the middle of that. I don't know that it's going to be a front-half/back-half kind of discussion. We're going to continue to work through it and as we do it, we'll adjust the targets and the plans there. But we're making good progress. I'll just tell you that, I think. On SG&A, really three dynamics, I think, that are probably inconsistent with how people are thinking about it. One is, obviously, I'm not sure everybody fully got the A&C step-up that we're doing here. And that's obviously showing up in the SG&A. We have, obviously, incentive comp that flows through there, and given the strong performance versus targets, that's up year over year. And then currency. I mean, I think those are the three big drivers that would represent \u2013 and I'd probably tell you a third, a third, a third \u2013 in terms of where it is in SG&A. So the underlying performance in overheads, the work that we're doing on indirects, and the broader organizational activities is generating benefits. We exceeded our internal targets on ZBB benefits this year, and we've actually taken up what we're going to do there for 2016 as part of the plan. Alexia J. Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Alexia. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kenneth Zaslow of BMO Capital. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey. Good morning. I'll keep it real quick in terms of time. My first question is, given the challenges in South America, is there an opportunity to accelerate or reassess any sort of opportunities for cost savings or do anything different given that you have a different environment there? Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Look, I think we're pretty pleased with the businesses we have in Latin America. I think it does \u2013 I mean, there's some slight dynamics around our headquarters overhead in Latin America as a result of now deconsolidating Venezuela. I think it's more a country-by-country look at the dynamics of what's playing out in the Brazil market, or Argentina, or other places given inflation and what we're seeing in volatility. But, again, the fundamental dynamics in those markets, I mean, we like the gross margins, we like our competitive position. They are part of what we're doing on supply chain and ZBB and all the other activities. We'll continue to look at that and adjust targets as appropriate. But I'm not sure anything changes in terms of the big-picture plan for South America. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I mean, I would say we are constantly benchmarking each of our countries across our landscape, and as well as versus competitors to the best of our abilities. And so I think we've got a pretty good handle on where the opportunities are. And that's essentially been the plan that we've been executing. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. And a point of clarification, just making sure I understand it, your 18% margin does not require you guys to do anything besides hit your volumes in line with the category growth? There's no expectations in there that you should exceed? It's not dependent on any sort of volume numbers that are above the category? Is that \u2013 my understanding of that, is that fair? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Kenneth B. Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. Our final question comes from the line of David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Just a follow-up on some of the earlier questioning. What are some examples of how the economic weakness is causing you to revisit your marketing plans, if at all, whether it be value packaging or perhaps slowing the pace of new products or the pursuits of these white-space opportunities you mentioned? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think without a doubt it is certainly impacting how we execute our pricing. Depending upon the market, we're using a combination of tactics, whether it's list price increases, trade spending, reduction, price pack architecture both on the low end and the high end. And, quite frankly, that's allowed us, as we've had \u2013 as we've talked before, one of the benefits of our Lines of the Future is it gives us much greater flexibility with respect to packaging, which then allows us to execute pricing in a much less disruptive way to the marketplace. I think it's one of the reasons that you see our vol/mix improving as the year progressed and as we exited the year. So we certainly are doing our best to make sure that every price, it has as small an impact on the overall consumer landscape. I'd also say that virtually all of the pricing actions we have taken have been in response to comment to industry cost. And so some of the elasticity impact has simply been the time it takes for some of our competitors to execute pricing actions. And as we've seen those price gaps narrow in markets like Russia and Brazil, for example, or some of the actions we have taken in markets like the U.K. or Germany, we are seeing our shares improve. So we're doing our best to manage the landscape, and it varies market to market. But certainly as we think about some of our infrastructure investments, I'll give you the \u2013 we have a factory going up in Russia, for example. We've moved a lot more slowly in this current environment as we think about that investment as a result of what we're seeing in the macro environment. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And then, David, given the volatility, I mean, we're actively watching these A&C investments and the specific activities and tracking returns. And having the data and the tools and the willingness to adjust them and move money where it's paying off and where we see the long-term benefits is something that I think we're getting better, at and we've got some better processes in place to do that proactively as the volatility is playing out. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you very much. Operator : That was our final question. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks. Dexter Congbalay - Vice President- Investor Relations : Thanks, everyone, for joining the call this morning. Be around for the rest of the day, and of course over the next couple weeks as we head into CAGNY to address any questions. Other than that, we will see probably the bulk of you in Florida. Thanks again. Take care. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

(Broker) Operator : Good morning and welcome to Mondelez International First Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Mondelez management and the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Dexter Congbalay, Vice President Investor Relations for Mondelez International. Please go ahead, sir. Dexter Congbalay - Vice President- Investor Relations : Good morning and thanks for joining us. With me are Irene Rosenfeld, our Chairman and CEO and Brian Gladden, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our earnings release and today's slides, which are available on our website, mondelezinternational.com. As you know, during this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Excuse me. Some of today's prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Irene. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Dexter. Good morning. We had a good start to the year. We continued to drive top-tier margin expansion and earnings growth, while stepping up organic revenue growth. Specifically, organic net revenue grew more than 2%, as we drove our Power Brands, stepped up volume mix in developed markets, raised prices again to recover currency-driven input costs in emerging markets, and continued to eliminate less profitable brands and lower return spending. We expanded adjusted gross profit margin by 170 basis points to 39.7% by driving strong net productivity. Adjusted operating income margin expanded 240 basis points to 15.1%, as we continued to aggressively reduce overheads, while significantly stepping up A&C support. And finally, adjusted EPS was $0.48, up 31% on a constant-currency basis, driven by operating gains. Let's take a closer look at the details. Organic revenue in Q1 grew just over 2%, in line with our annual guidance. Importantly, the impact from our revenue management actions, which includes SKU reduction and trade optimization, was a little more than 1 percentage point. That's largely consistent with our full-year estimate of about 1.25 points, and you'll see in a few minutes how that played through our margins. We delivered this growth despite the volatile operating and currency environment that pressured category growth, especially in many of our larger emerging markets. In aggregate, emerging markets were up about 3.5%, as we priced to recover currency-driven inflation to protect profitability. Along with softening category growth, this pricing had some elasticity impact, which resulted in lower vol/mix in the short term. In contrast, developed markets grew 1.3%. What's noteworthy is that nearly all of this growth was driven by vol/mix, including solid growth in both Europe and North America. This reflects the continuation of the improvement in our vol/mix contribution, as the cost environment has moderated since early 2015. Power Brands continued to drive our growth. They were up nearly 4%, in line with our categories. The shift of Easter-related shipments into the first quarter provided us with only a modest benefit, given that Easter was only one week earlier than last year. Turning now to our results by region, despite the challenging environment, every region contributed to revenue growth, with three of them also delivering positive vol/mix. Latin America was up nearly 4%, all due to pricing in response to currency-driven inflation in Argentina and Brazil. Brazil was down low-to-mid single digits as the deteriorating political and economic environment pressured category growth. We expect operating conditions in Brazil to remain challenging for the balance of the year, and that's reflected in our current outlook. In contrast, Mexico, our second largest market in the region, was a bright spot. Revenue was up high-single digits, driven by strong volume and share growth in gum. EEMEA grew 4.5%, all driven by pricing in response to continued currency-driven inflation in several markets. Political and economic instability in several countries tempered category growth. Russia grew low-single digits, as higher pricing was mostly offset by elasticity and softer consumption due to the macro environment. Nonetheless, we held share in our two largest categories, chocolate and biscuits. As with Brazil, we remain cautious about the near-term operating environment in Russia, and that also continues to temper our full-year outlook. Asia Pacific grew almost 3%, including about a point of vol/mix growth. India, Australia and the Southeast Asian markets all contributed. Chocolate in India was up double digits, driven by vol/mix gains and stable shares in response to increased A&C support behind Cadbury Dairy Milk and continued momentum of our Bubbly innovation platform. Australia was up mid-single digits, behind strength in chocolate as we lapped our significant revenue management actions from a year ago, and invest in marketing and innovation behind our now more profitable chocolate and biscuit businesses. China was essentially flat. Biscuits revenue was down, reflecting the overall category slowdown. This was offset somewhat by continued double-digit growth in gum, despite a decline in that category as well. We remain cautious about China for the remainder of the year, given the soft consumer environment and category trends. Europe continued to show sequential improvement, delivering modest growth in the quarter, as price gaps narrowed and we selectively invested behind high ROI initiatives. Notably, Europe posted positive volume/mix, with strength in both chocolate and biscuits, behind Power Brands such as Cadbury Dairy Milk and OREO. Last but not least, North America was up about 2.5%, including a couple of points of vol/mix growth. Biscuits grew low-single digits, largely through higher vol/mix and share growth of OREO, belVita and Triscuit. In addition, we launched GOOD THiNS, a new biscuit innovation platform that capitalizes on consumer demand for more wholesome savory snack options. GOOD THiNS are delicious baked crackers made with potatoes, chickpeas or rice with no artificial ingredients. We launched GOOD THiNS in March, and it's already reached a 1.4 share of the U.S. cracker market. Turning now to our categories, in the first quarter, overall category growth was about 4%. However, given the timing of Easter, retail consumption shifted somewhat from Q2 into Q1. Excluding the Easter shift impact, overall category growth was roughly 3%. Our organic growth was about a point below our categories, due primarily to our revenue management actions. Importantly, as I mentioned earlier, our Power Brands grew about 4%, in line with our categories and drove significant margin expansion. Net-net, building on our Q4 momentum, about 65% of our snacks revenue gained or held share in the first quarter. Let's look at our performance in each of our categories. Biscuits grew about 2.5%, with notable strength in the U.S. and the UK. Our share performance was also strong, with around 80% of our biscuits revenue gaining or holding share. Our biscuits Power Brands grew mid-single digits, led by OREO and belVita. In chocolate, our revenue reflected strong growth in the UK, India and Australia, as the markets adjusted to our pricing actions. This was partially offset by soft results in Brazil and Russia. Together, these two markets tempered our overall chocolate growth by more than a point and a half. Shares were solid, with about half of our chocolate revenue gaining or holding share. We're pleased to see our momentum improving as price gaps narrow and our targeted investments pay off. Our performance in the UK was especially strong and a sharp turnaround from our share losses through most of 2015. We increased share by nearly a point behind increased A&C support and innovation, such as Cadbury Dairy Milk Big Taste and Cadbury Dairy Milk Medley. In Germany, our share decline in the quarter was due solely to cycling the impact of the revenue management actions we implemented in the second quarter last year. As a result, this is the last quarter of impact related to those actions. Gum & candy revenue increased almost 3%, led by strong growth of gum in Mexico and China and Sour Patch Kids candy in the U.S. About 60% of our gum & candy revenue gained or held share, with gains in Mexico, China and France. While we remain disappointed by continued aggregate gum share declines here in the U.S, we're encouraged to see both Trident and Dentyne growing. In addition, we'll be implementing a Stride turnaround plan later this year. To summarize, we're pleased with our first quarter results. We delivered solid top-line growth and share performance with improving vol/mix, despite continued volatility in some of our largest emerging markets. Our solid top line, together with strong delivery of productivity and cost savings, which Brian will describe in a moment, provide a good foundation for delivering our full-year forecast. Before I conclude, however, I'd like to pause for a moment to share a few thoughts about Mark Clouse, our Chief Commercial Officer. As you saw in today's press release, Mark will be leaving our company in a few weeks to become CEO of Pinnacle Foods. Mark is a talented executive and a natural leader who has made significant contributions to every aspect of our business over the last two decades, most recently as our Chief Commercial Officer. Mark has proven that he's ready for this next step in his career. We thank him and wish him and his family all the best. While, of course, we will miss Mark, we have a deep leadership team and I'm confident that they will continue to execute flawlessly. We will take this opportunity to further simplify and streamline our organization and so we won't be backfilling the Chief Commercial Officer role. With that, let me turn the call over to Brian. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Irene. Good morning, everyone. Building on Irene's comments, we delivered strong margin expansion and earnings growth, despite the continued challenging environment. Adjusted gross margin increased 170 basis points to 39.7%. Please note that this includes absorbing a 50 basis point headwind related to commodity and currency hedging contracts that don't qualify for hedge accounting treatment. Our gross margin expansion was driven by net productivity of more than 4% of COGS. That's up from about 3.5% last year and reflects continued progress as we implement integrated Lean Six Sigma and strong execution of our supply-chain reinvention program, including installing our state-of-the-art Lines of the Future around the world. In fact, we'll have four additional lines operational in our Salinas, Mexico facility by year end, complementing the seven lines already in place there. You may have also seen that we opened our latest greenfield plant in India on Monday. This plant will produce approximately 60,000 tons of Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolate annually to start. By 2020, this multi-category food campus is expected to reach annual capacity of 250,000 tons. Adjusted OI margin was 15.1%, up 240 basis points. Drivers of the improvement include the gross margin expansion, as well as overhead reductions, as we continue to drive ZBB cost savings. We did benefit from the timing of some overhead spending in the quarter that will negatively impact our second quarter, but we're fully on track to deliver our targeted cost savings related to indirect cost packages and the migration of back-office processes to global shared services. We also increased A&C support to more than 9% of revenue to support our Power Brands and drive profitable growth over the long term. Our cost reduction efforts drove margin improvement across all of our regions with the exception of Latin America, which was affected by the tough environment in Brazil. In both North America and Europe, the margin improvement was driven by strong net productivity and reduced overheads, offset by stepped up A&C investments to fuel growth. In North America, adjusted OI margin grew 260 basis points to 20.3%, and in Europe, margins were up 390 basis points to 19.7%. As you know, North America and Europe have expanded margins by more than 500 basis points and 600 basis points respectively, since the end of 2013. In EEMEA, margin was 11.5%, up 770 basis points versus what was an easy compare. As you may recall, in the first quarter of 2015, price increases were insufficient to cover the sharp increases in currency-driven input costs. In this quarter, strong net productivity, favorable vol/mix and overhead reductions were the key drivers of our margin expansion. In Asia Pacific, margin expanded 310 basis points to 16.1%. This was driven by continued productivity improvements as well as overhead reductions. In Latin America, given the challenging macro environment in Brazil, margin declined 260 basis points to 10.5%. This was largely due to unfavorable vol/mix and currency, which more than offset significant cost reductions. Now turning to EPS; adjusted EPS was $0.48, up 31% on a constant-currency basis. The increase was driven by $0.07 of operating gains, including a negative $0.02 impact from mark-to-market and a negative $0.01 from calendar adjustments. Below the operating line, EPS increased $0.05, as lower interest expense, the benefit from a lower share count, and lower taxes more than offset the dilution from the coffee deal. Our coffee investments in both JDE and Keurig had solid quarters and delivered in line with our expectations. In the quarter, we returned $1.5 billion of capital to our shareholders. Specifically we paid out about $270 million in dividends, and purchased $1.2 billion of stock or nearly 29 million shares at an average price of about $41. This amount includes the remaining $500 million of cash received as part of the JDE coffee deal that we committed to use for repurchasing stock. In addition, we opportunistically accelerated a portion of our 2016 buyback program into the first quarter. We continue to expect to buy back approximately $2 billion of stock for the year. Now turning to our outlook; given our strong start to the year, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our 2016 outlook and are reaffirming our outlook today. Specifically, we continue to expect to deliver organic revenue growth of at least 2%, adjusted OI margin of 15% to 16%, which is an expansion of at least 200 basis points this year, double-digit adjusted EPS growth, and at least $1.4 billion of free cash flow. In addition, based on recent spot rates, we expect less of an impact from currency translation. For revenue, we expect currency to be a 3 percentage point headwind, down from 6 points. And for EPS, we estimate a $0.05 headwind, down from $0.13. We've also updated a couple other items to help with your financial models. We currently estimate that our interest expense will be $625 million to $650 million, down about $25 million from our previous estimate. Due to some discrete items in the first quarter, we now estimate our full-year 2016 tax rate will be in the low 20%s, down from the low-to-mid 20%s in our prior outlook. While we're not providing quarterly guidance, I would like to call out a few items to keep in mind as you think about our second quarter. First, Q2 is typically our lowest margin quarter, given seasonally-lower revenues. Second, as we mentioned earlier, our first quarter benefited from the timing of some overhead spending, which will pressure our second quarter. Finally, as you may know, collective bargaining agreements covering eight U.S. facilities expired at the end of February. The affected employees have been working without a contract since that time, while we continue to bargain in good faith with the union. We've shared our last, best, and final offer with the union. We believe it's fair and the right solution for both our employees and our business. Until we reach an agreement, we expect to incur some one-time costs as we continue the negotiation, while executing business continuity plans for our North America business. Despite these short-term items, we're executing well and are confident in our business momentum and our ability to deliver on our full-year commitments. So to wrap up, we're pleased with our strong results in the first quarter. We delivered significant margin expansion, solid organic revenue growth and share performance with Power Brands up 4%, positive vol/mix growth in developed markets, and increased investments behind our Power Brands and innovation platforms. We also returned $1.5 billion to shareholders. While we remain cautious about the volatile operating environment, we're on track to deliver our 2016 outlook as well as our adjusted OI margin target of 17% to 18% in 2018. With that, let's open it up for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, good morning. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hi, Chris. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Thank you for the question. I just wanted to ask, and I think I heard a number of points that are worth mentioning, but in terms of the strong first-quarter performance, both EPS margin and even revenue growth, as we think about the full-year guidance, I think I heard some \u2013 a little bit of caution on Brazil, on Russia, on China, as well as some of the timing of overhead spending that can be moving margin around a bit. But I guess I wanted to understand the rationale for holding guidance where it is, and maybe just to answer my own question with those different points there, but are those the ones that are kind of keeping you from being more aggressive with the full-year outlook, in particular on the margin side? Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Chris, I think \u2013 look, we're very happy with the start, and I think it really does give us confidence as we think about the year, but it is just one quarter in an environment where, I think, it makes sense to be prudent. You've got an operating and currency environment that's pretty volatile. Consumer demand is somewhat soft, especially in emerging markets. And then we've got a lot going on in the transformation agenda. So, while we're executing well and we're doing the things that we can control and they are on track. I'd just say that the first quarter gives us a nice foundation to feel confident about the year and we'll leave it at that. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And just a quick follow-up for you. In relation to the \u2013 vol/mix was a little stronger than I thought in the quarter, and you made some comments about elasticity in some markets. I just want to get a sense of maybe you can characterize the pricing environment, and price in particular to currency driven-cost inflation. And just the competitive response. So are there markets we should kind of watch out for where you're taking prices up, but competitors have not moved yet, for example? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No. Actually, Chris, I think a big part of the strong vol/mix performance that you're seeing is that we've now gotten a lot of that behind us. Our gaps are closing. We've continued to invest in our franchises, particularly our Power Brands and that's playing itself through in vol/mix, as well as in our share performance. I think the markets that we've called out like Russia, like Brazil, that remain quite challenging from an inflationary and currency standpoint, are the places where there probably will continue to need to be some pricing. But for the most part, most of that pricing is behind us and that gives us great confidence with the foundation that we've built. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you for the time. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Chris. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning, everybody. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Andrew. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. Just two quick things from me. First off, Brian, in the guidance around full-year margins, you reaffirmed the 15% to 16% range, but I think on the fourth quarter call, you had specifically pointed to the low end of that range because you had deconsolidated Venezuela at the time. So that wasn't mentioned again this time. Is that just because of the better start around margins to the year, or am I just making more of it than I should? Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, I said it's about a 200 basis point margin improvement is what we're expecting, and that's the current outlook. So that does put you at the lower end of that range. And it's 200 basis points. So we feel pretty good about that. Dexter Congbalay - Vice President- Investor Relations : Yeah, no change. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No change. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: No change. Okay. And then, Irene, you had mentioned that, excluding these strategic actions that you've taken on the top line that you're growing about in line with your categories globally. Does that mean that even though, I guess, Easter was a benefit to global category growth by about a point, that it was not much of a benefit to Mondelez because otherwise I guess...? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well I think, Andrew, the simple answer there's a difference between consumption and shipment. So if Easter was essentially only a week earlier, so most of our shipments last year were in the first quarter. It doesn't change that much, but obviously the consumers' purchasing pattern happens within a week or so of the holiday. So you're going to see the impact. Our consumption was closer to the overall category growth, but our shipments don't reflect that, one because of revenue management, but two because it didn't have that much of an impact on our shipments to our customers. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Got it. And then the sustainability of developed markets volume that you saw and the improvement in \u2013 clearly, in the first quarter, I guess, there was an easier comparison in Europe in the year ago. There was a competitive recall in parts of Europe as well. So I'm just trying to get a sense of your level of visibility and comfort that developed markets volume can kind of remain more sustainably in positive territory as we go forward. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, we feel very good about the underlying momentum in our developed markets. Strong vol/mix performance as well as \u2013 they were doing that while Europe is up 400 basis points and North America up almost 300 basis points. So I feel very good about the hard work that they did over the course of the last year to get the businesses to win and then the opportunity now to build on top of that base. So I think the underlying momentum that we're seeing is solid and will continue for the balance of the year. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Andrew, and that was improving in the second half of last year as well. So, I mean, it's not surprising. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. It is not a totally new phenomenon. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just wanted to follow-up, I guess, on Andrew's question, just in terms of building organic sales growth over the balance of the year because, I guess, the comparisons get a little bit more difficult balance of the year, and it sounds as if maybe Brazil, Russia, China, from a macro perspective, a little bit weaker than maybe what you were planning going into the year. And I'm not sure how we should think about Nabisco, if there is some contingency or some potential disruption we have to factor in, in terms of balance of the year organic growth. So, if you could just talk through, A, are net your sort of view in terms of the macro, the same, better, or worse than they were going into the year, and then just sort of where we should look for drivers to get to that organic sales growth over the balance of the year, given that the comps get a little bit more difficult? Thanks. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, Bryan, again, the comps do get more difficult, but in part it was because we began, as Brian said, we began to make investments. We got a lot of the pricing behind us as we were in the back half of last year. And so the foundational things that we're doing in terms of reinvesting in high ROI marketing initiatives and continuing the expansion of some of our proven innovation platforms, all of that is in place. As you saw in the first quarter, our A&C is up over 9% of revenue. We're continuing to invest in our key franchises. And that will just continue as the year progress. So, yes, we have a headwind from some of these more volatile emerging markets, but as I said in my remarks, we feel pretty comfortable that we've accounted for those against the stronger momentum that we should see everywhere else. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And just, Nabisco, should we be \u2013 or North America, should we just be thinking or having to factor in some sort of probability or chance that there is some disruption? Just trying to figure out how to accommodate that or factor that in. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Bryan, I guess it's hard to predict where the negotiations go and the magnitude of an impact would really depend on the outcome of those negotiations. I think as I said, we'll incur some one-time costs, but that's about building business continuity capability and being ready. We're trying to strike a balance, I would say, between the inventory necessary and a business continuity plan, but also the incremental costs. So, we've taken into the account in our plans the possibility of disruption, but again, we'll plan accordingly and we'll deal with that as it happens, but it's hard to predict where that goes. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, good morning, folks. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Jason. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you for the question. First, a couple housekeeping items for you, Brian. Thank you for all the detail on the guidance. The one area you didn't touch on was the equity income line. It came in a little bit stronger than we were expecting. How should we think about that line item in the P&L as we move forward? And then, also sticking below the line, interest expense too was a bit lower, your guidance suggests it's going to step up. I guess the question there is why? Was there something unique about interest expense, a benefit that's not going to continue on the forward? Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, on the equity income line, as I said, the two larger investments there, JDE and Keurig both delivered in line with our expectations, maybe a little bit better in the quarter. I don't see anything that changes our expectation for the year. They're delivering on commitments and I don't think that changes at all. Interest expense, as I signaled in the comments, we're telling you it goes down by about $25 million for the year. It reflects the lower run rate we're seeing in some of refinancing activities we had in the first quarter and a little bit of currency. We're not necessarily dropping that through in terms of the outlook, but it does provide a little bit of an opportunity there. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. That's helpful. And can you enlighten us on what your expectations are for the equity income line? I don't think you kind of touched on it previously. And then, the second question goes back to the comments on trade budget optimization that I think you introduced on last call. I'm just curious if you can give us an update on sort of how those plans are progressing, if we are at a stage where there has been any deployment of different strategies or tactics, and what the learning has been so far? Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I'll take the first part. On JDE and Keurig, I mean we provided a page in the web deck that gives you the pieces to estimate that for the year. Nothing's really changed with that. And again, these are private companies. We don't plan on providing a lot of visibility to the ongoing performance or the details of that. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : With respect to revenue management, Jason, we think the opportunity is sizable, particularly on the trade side. And particularly as we think about increasingly focusing on our Power Brands and on our high-return activities. The challenge, of course, is the pace of implementation because it does have an impact in the short term, typically on volume, on share, on customer relationships. And so our approach remains to strike the right balance among all of those variables, but I'm quite confident you will continue to see the benefits of that playing through our margin profile. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yeah, got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi, there. Thank you. A question about category growth in biscuits. In prior quarters, you've shown a slide showing the global category growth rate and I don't think I see it here. But last quarter you said it was 7%. And if you're gaining share in 80% of your categories this quarter, the implication is that the category has slowed substantially. I wanted to know, could you give us a little color on that? Like is that just kind of inflationary pricing in 2015 that just isn't happening now in 2016, or is there something else happening for the category in biscuits that we should know about? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, good question, Rob. I would tell you that probably the single biggest impact on the overall category growth is the U.S. It's our biggest biscuit market and we did see that category slowing down. There's a lot of factors that contribute there. Some of our biggest customers are changing some of their merchandising policies, which is having an impact. I think we're still performing quite well within those constraints, but it is having somewhat of an impact on our overall performance. So, I think the facts are, our revenue in aggregate in North \u2013 our biscuit revenue in North America was up almost 3%, very strong vol/mix, but the category itself was a little weaker than we had seen, and our approach to that is just to continue to invest in our strong brands, to continue to introduce innovation like OREO Thins and GOOD THiNS, which are driving very strong results, and continuing to leverage the fact that we've got much more flexibility in our packaging capability as a result of the addition of assets like Salinas. So, I think we are clearly in charge of the category performance here in the U.S., and we have very strong plans in place to continue to drive that. So I would not read anything more than that into these results Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Appreciate the color. One quick follow-up. Can you give us more specifics on what this overhead shift into second quarter is? Why would it shift from first quarter into second quarter, Brian? Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's just simply the timing of some spending that we would have initially probably expected in the first quarter that's sliding into the second quarter. So, we saw a little bit of a benefit on our SG&A in Q1, and it'll be a little bit of a headwind in Q2. Total year doesn't change at all. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Thanks, everyone. I just had two questions. First, you've talked in recent quarters about the potential to begin to rebuild margins in some of your key emerging market regions, and I think the expectation was that this could be more of a 2017 and 2018 dynamic. We're still seeing headwinds in Eastern Europe, Latin America, a bit in Asia. During the quarter, margins were covered pretty sharply and read an all-time high at around 16%. So just curious, Brian, I guess what drove the margin performance there? Whether that was market mix or more sustainable recovery that we could see carry forward through the year? Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, I think it starts with ultimately getting the pricing right, which is clearly what's driving EEMEA and Latin America in the short term. But I do think it's the fundamental work that we're doing on getting net productivity to flow through and gross margins improving, while these regions are also doing ZBB and implementing shared services and all the things that are helping us reduce overhead. So the fundamental cost structure of the regions has gotten better. If we can get pricing right in the markets, we'll see improvement there, and that's what we saw in both EEMEA and Asia Pacific in the quarter, and Latin America was really the pricing challenge and the currency dynamics in Brazil that hurt us. So good progress there, but it's the same fundamental game plan and initiatives that are driving margins everywhere. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks. And, Irene, I wanted to come back to the GOOD THiNS launch and just get a better sense of how you are thinking about the rollout and the marketing resources there. I know it's still early so we probably haven't seen a huge amount in the marketplace yet, but should we expect to see a stepped up kind of big bet on A&C, or is this the case where you're going to be working more with social media and building out gradually? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, we've accounted for it in the context of our overall A&C. We're getting very good returns on our investments behind our Power Brands in the U.S., and we're going to continue to make those investments, so it is accounted for in our aggregate budget. We're very pleased with the early response both from our customers and from our consumers. As I mentioned, it's a 1.4 share after just a couple of weeks in the market. And so we will support it, but it is accounted for in the overall A&C targets that we've given to you. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks again. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Good morning. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, David. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : You mentioned that you remain cautious about the volatile economic environment. I was wondering if you could give more color about the trends you are seeing in markets like Russia and Brazil. And, of course, you have the benefit of seeing dollars and volume by week and month. And are you seeing that \u2013 the decline rates stabilize, or is that volatility or the deterioration in recent months just making it too difficult to make a call about the bottom in markets like these? Thanks. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : You know, David, it's a little hard to tell you are we at the bottom. What we're seeing is certainly worse than what we were seeing last year. And our team is managing through it. There's a little bit of a different situation in Russia versus Brazil, but they're both inflationary markets that are causing us to have to price. And it's having some impact on our categories and on consumer demand. So, we do remain cautious about the operating environment in both of those markets. We don't see any near term catalyst, too much of a change. But we're also not expecting it to get dramatically worse. So again, as I said in my remarks, we believe we've accounted for it in the outlook that we're giving to you, but it is one of the reasons that we are being cautious as we think about our outlook for the future. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And then, just a quick follow-up on Europe. Can you give some color about the improving trends there? Is this really all about the competitive price gaps? And with the comparisons easing in Germany, does it feel like you're turning the corner after this first quarter? Thanks. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : The simple answer is yes. We've taken a number of steps in Europe to get ourselves fit to win and I'm very pleased with the progress that the team has made. Without a doubt we took a very significant revenue management action in Germany last year. We will lap that as we exit the second quarter. And the rest of our business, I'm actually quite pleased to see strong performance on our chocolate business in Germany, ex that customer. We've gotten a terrific response to the incremental investments we have made in our UK chocolate business, where our shares are up almost a point in that geography. Our Power Brands are performing well. So I think we needed to reset our base and address the cost impact on our P&L. We have done that and you're seeing their impact in our gross margins, our operating margins, as well as a return to growth in the region. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Joshua A. Levine - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. It's Josh Levine on for Ken. Irene, you mentioned strong productivity that drove the gross margin improvements in the quarter. Can you help us think about the drivers, I guess, to the gross margin in more detail? Specifically maybe how much came from new plants, inflation, SKU rationalization that may have gone up (41:56) over and above I guess your typical productivity plans? I guess just any help you can offer about how sustainable those gains were would be great. Thanks. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Simple answer, Josh, is they're quite sustainable. The bulk of that net productivity is just coming from some of the fundamental work we've done with our teams on Lean Six Sigma and the improvements that we're seeing as a result of that. And that is a gift that keeps giving. We certainly are beginning to see some of the benefits of the 40 plus Lines of the Future that are operating around the world, and that is part of the algorithm that allows us to have great confidence, not only about our margin targets for this year, but the 2017 to 2018 target that we've given to you, as well. So it is a combination, but the bulk of it is driven by fundamental execution of our productivity programs around the world, and we're very pleased with that performance. Joshua A. Levine - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks. And I guess just one quick follow-up. There had been some recent news about you being in negotiations to sell a bunch of brands and some plants in Europe. I guess both can you just comment on some of the strategies there, some of the reasons for it, and then, to what extent maybe we could see more of that in the future. Thanks. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, look, we continue to focus on Power Brands as a priority, and clearly, there are some opportunities as you look at parts of our portfolio. We have an announced transaction that was in the press involving parts of our French business we sold to Eurazeo, which for us these are a very rational set of actions that are consistent with our agenda here. So we focus on Power Brands and our portfolio. We simplify our supply chain and allows to us invest behind the brands that have the highest returns. So that transaction is something that will likely close in 2017, as you get through regulatory approvals and works councils and all the things that go with that. But I would say that's just part of what we're doing as we think about focusing on Power Brands and there could be more opportunities like that, but nothing to talk about today. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Can I ask about the advertising spending? You talked about it being above \u2013 the A&C spending being above 9%. How much was that up year-on-year, and what's the outlook for subsequent quarters in the year? Is it going to be up more or perhaps less going forward? And maybe just to touch on innovation. Where are the big sort of white space opportunities that you're really getting your teeth into this year? What are the main applications of the innovation pipeline in terms of new products at the moment? Thank you and I'll pass it on. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So, first of all, with respect to A&C, our A&C is up about low-single digit, mid-to-low single digits, and again, as part of our overall plan to continue to improve our share of voice, you will see that going up for the full year. So there's nothing anomalous about the first quarter and we are very pleased that given the strong performance that we are seeing on our margin improvement, we have the opportunity not only to drop that money to the bottom line, but also to reinvest in areas that get a good return for us. With respect to innovation, we continue to have a very strong portfolio of platforms, and you will continue to see us take those ideas around the world. And so, for example, OREO Thins started in China. We have expanded it to the U.S., Canada, and now into Australia. It's going to be about a $200 million business for us this year. belVita Crunchy, we started in many markets with a soft version, we now we have a hard version, we call it belVita Crunchy, that's going to be about $500 million for us this year as we expand it to a variety of different markets. We have a number of innovations on our Cadbury Dairy Milk and Milka franchises that we're taking around the world. So net-net, we've been seeing a double-digit contribution to our revenue growth from these innovations and you'll see that continue and a portion of our investment, as I talk about spending in the 9% to 10% range on A&C, a portion of that is in support of those franchises Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. I will pass it on. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Dave Driscoll with Citigroup. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Thank you for squeezing me in here. I appreciate it. So I had two questions. The first one was just on the constant-currency outlook of 2% or better. Can you talk a little bit about the components of price and volume? I would assume that because foreign exchange pressures are lower, you don't need to take as much pricing as you were previously contemplating. So would it mean that the price piece has come down and then commensurately you would expect volumes to go up because of elasticities, positive elasticities? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : The simple answer is yes, David. So as we said to you, our long-term algorithm is a much better balance between pricing and vol/mix. We were very skewed in these last two years or so because of the very significant impact of currencies, as well as some of our inputs like cocoa. As we move forward, we should see a much different relationship and I think you're starting to see the impact of that play through in our first quarter as you can see pricing is a lesser impact and we're starting to see, even though vol/mix in aggregate is still negative, it's an improved trend and certainly I'm very pleased to see three of our five regions with positive vol/mix. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Maybe, Irene, just to say this, but since the 2% number doesn't change, then it's almost got to be like offsetting effects that go on. Pricing come down, volume goes up. And I just wanted to be clear that that is, in fact, how to think about this thing. And I know you guys put the plus sign by the 2%, so we never really know exactly what the figure is. But the right answer here is that you would see whenever pricing doesn't come down or however much it is lower than the previous estimate, the volume elasticity will make up for it. Dexter Congbalay - Vice President- Investor Relations : Hey, David, it's Dexter. Just kind of a quick clarification. At CAGNY, you may recall, in developed markets this year we said it was going to be positive vol/mix for the year and emerging markets, excluding Brazil and Russia, would be positive for the year, including Brazil and Russia, emerging markets volume would be negative. We really didn't give a total company view, but yes you are right, the pricing benefit obviously should be much more muted than it was last year given the currency dynamics and the commodities dynamics and trends in vol/mix will definitely improve versus last year as well. And you started to see that play through in the first quarter. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And then, Brian, just one question for you. But it's \u2013 it might be a fascinating question here. Do you have an assessment on what the impact is to Mondelez from the new treasury rules that were issued on April 4? It seems like there is three areas that there could be some impact, whether it is tax rate, share repurchase or cash repatriation. Do you have any assessment for us on any impacts from those new treasury rules? Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : David, what I would say is, we continue to work through that. I would tell you that as we work through it from a tax rate standpoint for modeling purposes, we don't anticipate any impact. There are some other things, as you mentioned, that we'll continue to work through and gain a better understanding of how they may impact us, but nothing to share at this point. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Thank you so much. Operator : I will now turn the call back to management for closing remarks. Dexter Congbalay - Vice President- Investor Relations : Hi, it's Dexter. Thanks for joining the call this morning. I'd be happy to take any further calls or comments as today is \u2013 the rest of the week and of course over the course of the day. And I'll be around to take any calls. Thank you again. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker) Matt Romariz - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States) Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC Operator : Good morning and welcome to the Mondel\u0113z International second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Mondel\u0113z management and the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Brian Gladden, EVP and CFO of Mondel\u0113z International. Please go ahead, sir. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Great, thank you, Paula. Good morning and thanks for joining us. Before we get started, I wanted to take a moment to thank Dexter Congbalay for his many contributions to our company throughout the years, including most recently running both Treasury and Investor Relations. As most of you know, Dexter will be leaving us this month. He's been a trusted partner. We'll wish him the very best both personally and professionally. I'd also like to introduce Shep Dunlap, who has joined us as our VP of Investor Relations. Shep brings a great set of skills and experience, and I'm sure you'll enjoy working with him as he settles into his new role here. With that, let me turn the call over to Shep to get started. Shep Dunlap - Vice President, Investor Relations, Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Thanks for the introduction, Brian, and I'm happy to be here. Earlier today, we sent out our earnings release and presentation slides, which are also available on our website, MondelezInternational.com. As you know, during this call, we will make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K and our 10-Q filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation. With that, I'll now turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Irene Rosenfeld. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Shep, and good morning. Despite a challenging environment, we continued to deliver solid results, and we're confident in delivering our 2016 outlook and 2018 margin targets. I'm pleased with the progress made by our teams in reinventing our supply chain, reducing overheads, and reinvesting in growth. Our strategy is working, driving strong near-term margin performance, providing fuel for investment, and positioning us to sustainably deliver top and bottom line growth. Long term, we expect our advantaged platform together with an ongoing focus on growth and margin expansion to drive organic net revenue at or above our category rates, double-digit adjusted EPS growth, improving cash generation, and significant return of capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. With that as context, let's review the highlights of the second quarter. Organic revenue grew 1.5%, including the negative impact of about a point from revenue management actions. Through the first half, our growth rate was 1.9%. Our power brands once again drove our top line, up 3% and in line with global categories. Emerging markets rose nearly 4%, fueled by currency-driven pricing in markets like Argentina and Russia. Developed markets were essentially flat but delivered another positive quarter of vol/mix while continuing to significantly expand margins. Our overall share performance was not yet where we wanted it to be, but we began to see meaningful improvements in a number of key markets, like chocolate in the UK, Germany, Australia, and India, as well as biscuits in Europe, and globally across our gum and candy business. This progress was partially offset by declines in some large markets such as U.S. biscuits and Brazil, where our near-term share positions were negatively impacted by aggressive competitive trade promotions. Brian will discuss market share in more detail in a moment. Adjusted OI margin for the second quarter was strong, up 210 basis points versus prior year. Cost control has now become embedded in our culture and we're firing on all cylinders, both in supply chain as well as in overheads. These first half results position us well for the full year. Our focus on cost enables us to expand margins while continuing to fuel growth. In that spirit, let me take you through two exciting opportunities that will be important drivers going forward. First, we're delighted to announce the launch of our Milka brand into China's $2.8 billion chocolate market. This is a prime example of the growth strategy in action. As we've discussed, most of our emerging markets are one- or two-category countries. We added gum to our leading China biscuit business in the second half of 2012. And today that business generates annual revenue of approximately $200 million. By leveraging a formidable power brand like Milka in a sizeable category white space, we see significant potential for chocolate in a market where per capita consumption is quite low, even by emerging market standards. We expect our unique brand assets, industry-leading innovation, a new world-class manufacturing facility, and strong sales and marketing capabilities will not only grow our business, but will also accelerate the category. While chocolate in China has recently been challenged, we believe we're well positioned to succeed. Our plans have been presented to customers and we'll enter the market in the next few weeks, well before the critical Chinese New Year season. Finally, while only a small part of our business today, we have significantly bolstered our capabilities in e-commerce. Although online snacks are relatively under-developed, we believe e-commerce will be increasingly important as consumer purchasing behavior changes. Our intent is to capture share in this fast-growing channel by leveraging our strong brands and marketing knowhow. Since the start of the year, we've taken a number of steps, including: enhancing our infrastructure; adding new experience resources and building capability; strengthening our partnerships with Amazon in the U.S., Alibaba in China, and with the e-commerce arms of our traditional retailers; as well as accelerating gift offers with personalized packaging and subscriptions on brands like Cadbury in the UK. Early results are very encouraging. In the first half, we grew our e-commerce revenue by more than 30%. Looking ahead, our goal is snacking leadership in e-commerce and over $1 billion in sales by 2020. The launch of chocolate in China and our progress in e-commerce are just two examples of investments that are continuing to build and transform our advantaged platform. Looking ahead, there's no question that the environment remains challenging, especially in emerging markets. We remain focused on what we can control, margin and share. To that end, we're taking a number of actions that will impact the second half. These include : increased A&C on our power brands; targeted investments in trade spending to narrow price gaps in key markets; several significant innovation launches, including chocolate in China; and continued expansion of our routes to market, including e-commerce, all while continuing to drive cost reduction across the enterprise. We remain confident in our strategy and execution to grow both our top and bottom lines over the long term and to create significant value for our shareholders. Before I close, I know many of you would like an update on the potential transaction with Hershey. While I can confirm that we did make an offer to Hershey, as you would expect regarding any potential M&A activity, we have no additional comments to make. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Irene. We had solid financial results for the second quarter and the first half of the year. Specifically, we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted OI margin expansion and earnings growth. Adjusted gross margin of over 40% was flat in Q2, as the negative impact of mark-to-market as well as currency-driven inflation offset another quarter of strong net productivity. In fact, our efforts to reinvent our supply chain and deploy advantaged manufacturing lines of the future continue to drive margin benefits, as we delivered net productivity of better than 3.5% for the first half. Q2 adjusted OI margin was 15.2%, up 210 basis points. This was largely driven by the ongoing ZBB [Zero-Based Budgeting] impact on our overheads and especially our execution on shared service initiatives. In addition, the margin expansion included some one-time favorable impacts from asset sales in North America. These proceeds more or less offset the negative impacts of mark-to-market and the cost of our U.S. labor-related business continuity planning. We're pleased with our first half margin performance and are slightly ahead of our plan, as our cost execution has exceeded expectations. We're also investing in additional A&C and selected incremental trade spending during the second half to support top line growth and improve share. Let me now provide some color on regional performance for both revenue and margins. North America had a very solid \u2013 a very strong margin quarter. Adjusted OI margins expanded by 470 basis points, driven by strong productivity, overhead cost reductions, as well as the previously mentioned asset sale benefit, offset somewhat by the U.S. labor business continuity planning costs. We grew organic revenue nearly 1%, driven by vol/mix increases. Escalated trade spending by our competitors negatively affected our short-term results. Overall, biscuits were up only modestly. But Oreo, belVita, and Triscuit all delivered solid consumption growth. Candy posted strong results, driven by Sour Patch Kids and Hall's. In gum, Trident turned in another quarter of solid performance, and we began the relaunch of Stride late in the quarter, which should improve shares in the months ahead. As Irene mentioned, we have several strong programs in place to better position us for the second half. Europe also had an outstanding margin quarter, with adjusted OI margin up 350 basis points to 18%, driven by strong productivity and lower overheads. Organic revenue in Europe was essentially flat, although here too we're seeing a nice progression in vol/mix and share trends. Both our chocolate and biscuit categories delivered strong results in the UK and Germany, which helped grow vol/mix by 70 basis points for the region. Building on last year's launch in the UK, we also lunched Ritz Crisp & Thin crackers in France, which is delivering good results, as we take the brand to a new consumption occasion. In EEMEA [Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa], adjusted OI margins were flat, driven by weaker demand and the resulting volume leverage impact. Organic revenue declined more than 2%, driven by a slowdown in the Middle East and North Africa, where economic and geopolitical volatility, including the impact of low oil prices, is having a more pronounced effect on consumer demand. A very weak Ramadan season in the Middle East also tempered the top line. Despite that backdrop, Russia turned in a solid performance, growing low double digits as a result of pricing actions to offset inflation. In Asia-Pacific, our adjusted OI margins were up 190 basis points, driven by improved overheads, strong productivity, and pricing. Organic revenue increased 2% and vol/mix was positive, up more than 1%. This is our fifth consecutive quarter of growth in Asia. India benefited from the launch of Bournvita biscuits, which addresses consumers' growing need for a morning snack under a well-known brand that delivers taste and nutrition. Chocolate also generated solid gains. Australia was also strong while Southeast Asia was up for the third straight quarter. Our Kinh Do business in Vietnam continues to be a bright spot. Our teams are executing well as we integrate this business, which provides a platform to drive our power brands through its distribution network of 130,000 outlets. China declined low single digits, as the biscuit category slowed and we lapped last year's Trident gum launch. While overall China consumer demand has recently slowed, we believe longer-term dynamics will improve, as evidenced by our significant investment in chocolate that Irene discussed earlier. In Latin America, adjusted OI margins declined 210 basis points. Difficult economic conditions in Brazil pressured margins in the form of currency and volume headwinds. Latin America organic revenue grew nearly 9%, led by strength in Argentina and Mexico. Argentina grew double digits primarily due to inflation-driven pricing, while Mexico had a strong first half and continued to gain momentum, as strong vol/mix contributed to high single-digit revenue growth. Brazil declined low single digits, and we see no short-term catalyst for improvement in the Brazilian economy. We're taking actions to close selected price gaps, but we expect the market to remain challenging in terms of both revenue and margins at least through the second half. Let me spend a moment providing a few highlights by category. In aggregate, categories have slowed to about 3% year to date, driven by key emerging markets like Brazil, China, and India. Our global biscuits business grew nearly 2%, with strength in the UK, in the U.S., and Germany. Oreo led the way, growing high single digits. In addition, we're continuing to drive our well-being portfolio. belVita grew high single digits globally, while our GOOD THiNS innovation in the U.S. also posted solid results. While our biscuits share has been challenged in some key markets, we have a number of actions underway to address the issue. In the U.S., we're innovating across several winning biscuit platforms while investing incremental trade spending behind our DSD [Direct Store Delivery] execution. In Brazil, we're investing in additional advertising and consumer support while selectively narrowing price gaps on key SKUs. Our focus remains on improving our share position. We expect the incremental actions we're taking will improve our share position in the second half. Chocolate grew more than 2%, driven by solid results in India, Australia, and the UK. Also in the quarter, Germany continued to deliver strong growth as we lapped last year's revenue management actions. More than half of our revenue in chocolate grew share. Gum and candy increased nearly 2%, led by solid performance in the U.S. and Mexico. About half of our revenue in this category gained or held share. Now turning to earnings per share, for Q2, our adjusted EPS was up more than 4% on a constant currency basis, which includes the impact of coffee dilution. And for the first half, adjusted EPS increased 17% on a constant currency basis. Operating gains of $0.15 were the primary driver of the improvement. Below the line, adjusted EPS declined $0.01, as dilution from last year's coffee deal more than offset benefits from lower share count, taxes, and interest expense. Note that this will be the last quarter of coffee dilution, as we lap the close of last year's coffee transactions. I would note that both JDE and Keurig performed well in the quarter and contributed some upside versus our expectations. In the second quarter, we delivered more than $500 million of free cash flow and improved our cash conversion cycle by 20 days to minus four days. Returning capital to our shareholders remains a priority for us, and we've returned more than $1.8 billion to shareholders through the first half. We've repurchased more than $1.3 billion in our shares at an average price of $41.07, and we continue to target $2 billion in share repurchases for the year. Last week, we also announced a 12% increase in our quarterly dividend. Dividends remain an important part of our capital return strategy, as we target a payout of at least 30%. Since the spin, we've returned nearly $13 billion of cash to shareholders. Let's take a closer look at our current outlook. As you've heard today, we feel good about our first half results and expect continued strong performance in the second half despite the macro backdrop, especially in the emerging markets. Specifically, we now expect the following for 2016. We've modestly reduced our organic net revenue growth outlook to approximately 2% from at least 2%. This reflects the increasing challenges we're seeing in global categories and includes about 100 basis points from revenue management actions. We continue to expect adjusted OI margin of 15% to 16% and are increasingly confident in delivering this commitment. As you think about the second half, we expect heavier investments in the third quarter, which would lead to higher margins in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect double-digit growth in adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis. Our view now includes an incremental $0.03 to $0.05 versus our last outlook due to solid operating performance, lower interest expense, and strong performance in our coffee joint ventures. Unfortunately, based on recent spot rates, this upside will be mostly offset by currency. We expect currency to be a four-point headwind to revenue growth, up from three points. And for adjusted EPS, we estimate an $0.08 headwind, up from $0.05. This also includes our view of the Brexit impact on our results, which is limited to an approximate $0.02 headwind related to the currency translation impact on our UK-based earnings. Our net transaction exposure is very limited, as we buy a majority of our global cocoa needs in British pounds, which offsets net transaction exposure in the UK. So to summarize our EPS outlook, the upside we're seeing in EPS allows us to fully offset the negative impact of currency changes, including Brexit. Finally, we still expect free cash flow, excluding items, of at least $1.4 billion. So to wrap up, we're pleased with our results in the first half. We delivered significant margin expansion while continuing to invest behind our power brands. Our vol/mix performance continued to improve, and we returned $1.8 billion to shareholders. While we remain cautious about the challenging operating environment, we're confident in our ability to deliver on our top and bottom line targets, and we remain on track to reach our adjusted OI margin target of 17% to 18% in 2018. With that, let's open it up for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from Chris Growe of Stifel. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, good morning. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hi, Chris. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hi, Chris. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. I had just two questions for you, if I could, to start off. And the first question I wanted to ask was just in relation to your developed versus developing market growth. This quarter seemed to show a little softer growth in developed markets actually. I had expected a little bit of pressure in Brazil and some of those markets, and you certainly cited those. But overall emerging market growth was about consistent with where it was in the first quarter. Do you expect that to weaken a bit as it goes to the second half as some of these markets are more challenged? And is it developed markets then pick up a little bit in the second half of the year from where they are currently? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Actually, I think, Chris, you have to separate \u2013 I think your assessment about emerging markets is correct. Obviously, we're feeling like \u2013 having watched what's happening, particularly in Brazil, we're seeing more softness there than we had anticipated. But I'd say in our developed markets it's really all about North America. And Europe is actually continuing to improve sequentially. We're seeing strong vol/mix performance. We're seeing nice performance on share. And so the big change is really on our U.S. biscuit business, whereas we mentioned we saw some very aggressive trade spending from some of our competition. It is not helping to grow the category, but we certainly are responding. And I would tell you even in the early couple of weeks in July we're starting to see that business come back. So net-net, we do expect our developed markets to continue to show strong performance in terms of vol/mix improvement as well as share. But our overall forecast continues to be somewhat muted because the aggregate category growth, which we had thought would be in the 3% to 4% range, is below the lower end of that range, and that's really what's driving our forecast. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : The other thing I would add, Chris, is just emerging \u2013 the growth was similar in Q1 and Q2, but the quality in terms of vol/mix got better. So it's not nearly as price driven as it was in the first quarter. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay; that's helpful. Thank you for that color. Just a quick question for you then on the guidance. Obviously, the revenue growth guidance has moderated a bit and so has the SKU rationalization expectation or activity there. On the margin side, are you seeing a little better margin? I think we were pushing more toward the low end of that range. Is 15% to 16% now a better range, if you will, versus the low end for your operating margin in 2016? Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I wouldn't change, Chris, the view. We feel really good about the first half. As I said, we're a bit ahead on the cost execution. Given the dynamics in the market, clearly it's a volatile environment, and we are planning to invest back and probably more than we would have expected in the first half of the year in the second half to drive some improvement in those shares and the growth. So I think we feel good with where we are. We're not really changing the outlook on margins. And being at 15%-plus for the first half gives us confidence for sure, but we're going to invest. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay; thanks so much for your time. Shep Dunlap - Vice President, Investor Relations, Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Thanks, Chris. Operator : Your next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, good morning, everyone. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Bryan. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just wanted to ask, I guess, a more broad question about capital allocation, and completely understanding that you can't talk specifically about Hershey. But one question that we've fielded quite a bit over the last few weeks has been just from a broader perspective, Irene, that you're at a point now where you're considering doing a relatively good-sized acquisition. Can you just talk to how you get to that point? Is it because the company is at a point now where you feel like you're ready to make a \u2013 can take on a transaction like that? Does it make a statement about what you think maybe the medium or longer-term outlook is for some of the categories, given what's changed in emerging markets? Just some context or color in terms of how you got to the point where you're ready to at least contemplate potentially making a large transaction. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So, Bryan, our capital allocation strategy has not changed. And as I said in my remarks, we have no additional comments on the Hershey situation. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay; thank you. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Bryan. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Lazar of Barclays Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Morning, everybody. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Andrew. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Two things for me. One, the move into China with the Milka brand -- I guess my question there is following on to Bryan's really is more about timing. I guess why is now the right time for something like that? Are there capabilities now that you didn't have before that you have now? Is it there's more clarity on productivity efforts that enable the investment at this point? I'm really trying to get a better read on the timing of this announcement because obviously the white space here in China in chocolate has been around for quite some time. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So we have been planning this for some time, as you said. And one of the most important poles in that tent is local production. And so we have a factory now up and running in Suzhou, and it's ready to go. We have continued to monitor the marketplace to understand the opportunities, both in terms of our portfolio as well as in our channels. And obviously, e-commerce is an important channel for us in China, and our partnership with Alibaba is a critical piece of our launch plan. So it was, frankly, just the opportunity to get all the various elements together for the launch plan. But we think it is quite representative of the growth opportunity that we see in a number of our emerging markets. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then 2Q gross margin came in I guess a little below what we had been modeling. I realize there was less of a benefit from mark-to-market, but I think gross margin comps do get tougher in the back half. And I know this is supposed to be a very big year with respect to supply chain efforts, and we're seeing some of that come through. So I guess is 2Q the way we should be thinking about gross margin expansion for the next few quarters, or are we likely to see the rate of year-over-year change for gross margin improve moving forward? Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Look, I guess, Andrew, I would say if you look at the quarter, maybe I'd start with year-to-date gross margins up 150 basis points ex-mark-to-market, the quarter ex-mark-to-market up 70 basis points. Developed markets have been very strong on gross margins. I think in the quarter, you would have seen some challenges in terms of keeping up with currency-driven inflation in a couple markets. Brazil is a good example. EEMEA is a bit of a challenge in terms of volume leverage. So I would tell you, as we've said and as we shared in the conferences, this is going to be primarily a gross margin driven continued margin expansion. The supply chain work that we're doing is still significant. We feel great about that. The net productivity was very strong. And I think gross margin will continue to be a driver of the margin expansion for us. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the questions. Brian, I guess I wanted to ask first about your revenue management efforts. My sense is that you're still in the relatively early stages of analyzing and starting to unlock some of those efficiencies. So as you talked today about the need to reinvest back into trade in the U.S. and a few other markets, should we really expect trade optimization to have a meaningful impact on price/mix dynamics or margins this year, or is it something that you're looking at over more of a multiyear timeframe? Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I wouldn't really change anything from what we've said. It continues to be a large spend for us and a big opportunity. We've mobilized resources and analytically are better understanding our trade spend now on a global basis. And I would say we continue to look for opportunities to more effectively manage that spend. In some cases, it's going to allow us to reinvest those dollars in important markets where we think that's necessary to drive growth and good margins. Really for us, it's about balancing share and customer relationships and margins, and that's going to be an important part of how we manage the overall growth of the business and the margins of the business. So nothing's really changed in terms of what we're doing. The activity and the initiative is on track. And I think you'll always see us selectively reinvest trade spend where we have to where we think that's a prudent decision with good ROI. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, thanks, Brian, and just one follow-up on the organic sales trends in Eastern Europe. You mentioned some newer issues emerging in the Middle East and North Africa. I was just wondering if the impact from those was amplified by the seasonal timing in the quarter or a difficult comparison. And going forward into the second half of the year, would you expect the region broadly to return to some level of positive organic sales growth? Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I would say not a lot of seasonality in that. It's more the macro dynamics in oil prices, political instability. You can go right down the list. Clearly, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Yemen, Syria, those are markets that are challenging, and I would say just consumer demand was down and categories have been down. So we do see some signs of stabilization as we look to the second half of the year. And as we talked about, the other elements of that business, Eastern Europe, Russia has done very well, and there are parts of Africa that have also done well. So we'll manage it. I think it's one of the reasons why you saw us take down the overall view on revenue for the total year is that instability and that volatility. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Probably the only seasonality that does have an impact is Ramadan in the Mideast. And it was a slow Ramadan season in large measure, as Brian said, because of the macro environment, driven by low oil prices. And that's volume that just doesn't come back. But net-net, our outlook for a number of the other countries is to see continued momentum. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Thank you both. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Matt. Operator : Your next question comes from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi, thanks for the question. I think this is the second quarter in a row where you've said that you're increasing A&C support. But I'm having a little trouble understanding quantifying that and then figuring it out as a percentage of sales. Is it going up? Because \u2013 and then you also said you're increasing trade promotion in certain areas. So just in terms \u2013 maybe I could break it out this way. Internally, are you telling the organization that you're putting more money into marketing than you thought in the beginning of the year, like consumer marketing, and at the same time also more into trade promotion simultaneously? Thanks. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I guess, Rob, it varies a little bit by market. But I think overall we are getting good returns on the A&C investment, and that's why we continue to make those investments. Our A&C is above 9% of revenue. You won't have visibility to that right now, but we continue to see A&C as a critical driver of our brand equities. And certainly as you start to see the recovery in places like the UK, Germany, India, Australia, EU biscuits, it's all reflective of the investments that we're making. And so those are the kinds of places that we will continue to make investments as well as in digital marketing. That said, there are selected hot spots that we've talked about, particularly markets like U.S. biscuit and Brazil where our price gaps are not where we want them to be. And so we are going to invest some trade back in that business, but that's not going to be without A&C support to continue to drive the longer-term brand equity. So net-net, we are increasing A&C in those places where we feel we're getting an adequate return, and that's an important part of our algorithm going forward. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, thank you. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Rob. Operator : Your next question comes from David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. As a follow-up on that trade promotion question and also throwing in SKU rationalization, can you provide any specific examples of changes that you've been making? And have your expectations around trade promotion spending changed for this year given the competitive environment you just laid out? Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : For sure, David. I think the reality is we are seeing a little bit different environment where not only we're a bit weaker in terms of category growth in some markets, but seeing how competitors play. And a couple examples we called out in the discussion are North American biscuits and Brazil, where we've seen more aggressive competitive trade spend that's affected our shares and our growth. So that's clearly a place where we're redeploying trade spend. And I would say we're finding, to the first part of your question, we are finding opportunities to free up some dollars in other trade spending we do across the business and realign it in those markets, which is going to be important given the environment that we're seeing. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Are there any specific examples that you can cite in terms of bigger buckets that have changed with regard to trade promo spending and SKU rationalization? Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : SKU rationalization has been ongoing. That's a contributor as much to what we're doing on net productivity and supply chain reinvention. So without getting into specific details on where we might be cutting trade spend or specific accounts, I'm not going to probably get into that. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, good morning, folks. Thank you for the question. I wanted to circle back to Rob Moskow's question in terms of A&C spend. Can you give us the specifics in terms of what advertising within SG&A has done year to date and what your expectation is for the full year? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Jason, we'll give you that number at the end of the year as we always do in our 10-K. But again, advertising is an important component of our overall brand equities. We will continue to look to make sure that our share of voice and share of market are well aligned. And I've been very clear about where the key markets are where we're making those investments. But we will continue to monitor the returns that we're getting on those investments, both near term as well as over the longer term. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay; let me try another one then. Let's talk price real quick. I appreciate that vol/mix has gotten better. Comparisons certainly are more favorable going forward. But price is sliding a little bit. It sounds like the trajectory on the forward is even weaker, which isn't inconsistent with what we're hearing from other companies. Is that consistent, though, with how you're looking at the world right now? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Look, covering costs with our pricing is critical to our algorithm, as you know. And so it is our intent to continue to price to offset higher input costs, particularly those that are common to industry. And currency in particular continues to be a headwind for us in most markets around the world. And so the key for us as we think about protecting gross margins as well as continuing to drive our ability to invest in our brands, making sure that we have adequate coverage of our cost is critically important. As the market leader, we typically are the first to increase prices. It does often lead to some temporary dislocation, but it ultimately recovers. I talked a lot about \u2013 last year I talked a lot about our share position in chocolate in general, but particularly in markets like the UK and Germany. It took some time for the consumers to adjust to those new price points. And now we're starting to see our shares recover. So there's no question there's some short-term dislocation, but our ability to cover costs with our pricing is critical to our overall algorithm. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it; very good. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : 2016, as we've said to you, pricing will be less of a factor than it has been in the past years, but we still do see a couple of the emerging market economies that are going to require that we continue to price. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Yes, yes. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from David Driscoll of Citi. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Great, thank you and good morning. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, David. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Brian, just a minor, minor thing -- apologies here. You said $0.08 on the FX impact. I think your slide actually says minus $0.09. Did you just misspeak, or is it \u2013 which one is it, $0.08 or $0.09? Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's $0.08, and if the slide is wrong we'll get it fixed. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): No worries; it's minor. Just want to make sure I'm writing the right things here. The big picture, I'd just like to go back to the capital allocation and just at least give it a try, see what you think of this question. But if the margin upside is as good as laid out and if there is more to come after 2018, why not just take the capital and buy back stock and execute the margin improvement program? Wouldn't a large acquisition require the sale of equity, which is presumably under-earning right now? And then I just want to say, Irene, that I'm really trying to make this not a Hershey question, and I totally understand your sensitivity. I'm really trying to focus on the margin potential side of this and how big is that margin potential over time. And then lastly, I'd just note this builds on the big margin changes that we've seen at the peers with some announcement for bigger margin expectation having just gotten rolled out. So it's incredibly topical. Thank you. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So, David, we really believe our point of difference versus other companies is our ability to grow on both the top and the bottom line. We have an advantaged set of assets both in terms of our brand portfolio, our routes to market, as well as in our overall geographic footprint. And we will continue to invest in those assets to drive long-term growth. In the near term and frankly over the longer term, the funding source for those investments will come from continued margin expansion. And as you rightly point out, we see opportunity, as you've heard from us this morning. We continue to see opportunities to deliver margins in the 17% to 18% range in 2018, and certainly we will continue to see opportunities beyond that. So margin remains the source of expansion to the bottom line as well as a source of funding for us to continue to invest in our brand franchises. Even as our global categories have slowed, snacking categories are growing at a much faster rate than other food, and we continue to see the long-term potential of investing in that growth opportunity. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay; I'll leave it there. Thank you. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, David. Operator : Your next question comes from Alexia Howard of Bernstein Research. Matt Romariz - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, this is Matt Romariz standing in for Alexia. Good morning. Thanks for the question. And I was just wondering if you could give us a brief update on your China business. You mentioned the initiative of launching chocolate there now. Basically, it's broad-sized within the APAC segment. Is its profitability broadly in line with the segment profitability we see? Just general color in the China business would be nice. Thank you. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : China is an important market for us. We have some of the most attractive gross margins in that market of any of the emerging markets in the world. But there's no question that the economy has weakened, and that's contributed to slower growth of our categories. And so we have continued to selectively invest in marketing support in our power brands and in particular in e-commerce, as the fastest growth in e-commerce is occurring in China. And we actually see close to 10% of snacks being purchased online, and it's one of the drivers of the partnership that we struck with Alibaba. So we really believe that strong programming we have on our core franchises, biscuit and gum, together with the launch of China will help us to continue the momentum in that market. But near term, we do remain cautious, given the economy. But there's no question as we look at the long-term profile, the growing middle class, the urbanization of the population, and the opportunity for continued distribution gains, China will continue to be an important part of the growth story. Matt Romariz - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: But any ballpark numbers for profitability that you can share? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We are not providing profitability by country. Matt Romariz - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: All right. Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from John Baumgartner of Wells Fargo. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning, thank you. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, John. Are you with us, John? We lost you. Operator : Okay, he may have got disconnected. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Can you hear me? Operator : Okay, John. Go ahead. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I'm sorry, sorry about that. I'd like to ask about the power brands and that the rate of growth there has really moderated from solid mid-single digits the last two years down to 3% this quarter. Can you walk through what's behind that deceleration? And maybe specifically the extent that you've already realized some of the easier distribution gains, and now it's just a slower build going forward, or is it really just tied back to biscuits and the macro issues in general? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I would say it's the latter, John. There's no question that if you think about our overall share performance, we're only down 0.3 points of share in the U.S. biscuit. But given the size of that market, it has a profound impact on our overall performance. And so there's no question that getting that U.S. biscuit business back growing again more significantly is a critical piece of our overall performance. But our power brands will continue to be the growth drivers of our overall portfolio. They carry higher margins. They grow at a faster rate. And we expect that we are now over time continuing to put them on advantaged assets through the work we're doing in supply chain reinvention. And so the Q2 numbers were largely impacted by the U.S. biscuit situation. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And there are big power brand exposures in some of the emerging markets that have slowed, John, so it's really the macro. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : But the white space opportunity is still just as strong as it's been going forward? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Absolutely, absolutely. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Kenneth Zaslow of BMO Capital Markets. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey, good morning, everyone. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hey, Ken. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Hey, Ken. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I have two sizing questions in terms of the new markets. When you think about China and the chocolate market, you said that gum is growing to about a $200 million business over a four-year period. Is that the right metric to think about it and how big this white space opportunity is? Is it bigger than that? Can you just size the opportunity for us? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I'm not going to give you our business proposition. But again, we see it as a very attractive market. And frankly the opportunity, many of the players in that market have not performed particularly well of late, and so we see it as a real opportunity for us to take some leadership and get the category growing faster. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay, all right. And then the second question that I have is when you think about the online business, I think you said $1 billion in 2020. Is that all incremental? Does that take away other business? How much of that do we actually think of as truly new business? Is there a way to parse that out as well? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Obviously, it's early days, Ken, and so I think it's hard to tell you exactly how incremental it is as consumers shift their behavior from more traditional channels. It's not going to be 100% incremental. But there's no question that we have the opportunity as we look at the kinds of items were offering in those channels as well as the nature of the consumption occasions that the consumer is using those channels for, be it gifting or subscription opportunities, that clearly will be incremental to our base business. And so it's one of the reasons we're so encouraged about that opportunity and have chosen to invest significantly behind it. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. I guess what I'm trying to get at is I understand that this year is a little bit weaker in terms of sales growth relative to your long-term expectations. But are there other legs to the stool like these that you expect to see acceleration? Is that the way to think about it? Is that how you see white space opportunities in these growth algorithms, and that's how you're going to get back to that higher level of growth? Is that the way to think about it? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I think the opportunity is both white space in terms of our category participation as well as our channel participation. As we look at emerging markets, for example, we still see growth in the traditional trade. And so part of our investment in route-to-market in areas like Brazil or India or even China as we think about getting outside the main cities is designed to access those consumers and that consumption that we don't cover with our participation in the modern trade. So it's both white space with respect to brands and innovation opportunities as well as with respect to channel. Kenneth Bryan Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great, I really appreciate it. Thank you. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Ken. Operator : We have time for one more question. Your final question comes from Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Edge Research. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Good morning, thanks for getting me in, just a couple quick ones. First, if you look at what Hershey did recently in China, it actually extends the milk chocolate Hershey brand to a lot of different places. They've recently had to significantly retrench their growth expectations. So looking at that and maybe how much penetration and competition there is in the chocolate business, what it is about Milka that makes you think it's a good time right now to launch in China? And secondly, if I can, what is it about just this fascinating 10% or so of snacks being bought in China via e-commerce? What is it that's going on in that market that makes that consumer want to buy snacks through your Alibaba partnership, e-commerce in general? And can you bring that to North America, to Latin America, other markets in a way where Mondel\u0113z can well outpunch the competition in that channel? Thanks very much. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : So, Jon, let me answer the second question first, which is absolutely we see the opportunity. There's no question. There are different models within e-commerce. Alibaba is much more of a single-item model versus some of the models that we see with some of our traditional retailers in the developed markets that are more just a market basket approach to a way to buy their normal purchases. So we see every opportunity to learn from the experience we're having with Alibaba and bring some of the unique items, some of the subscription opportunities for brands like belVita, for example, to the online space and to drive our growth. And that is the big opportunity that we see. We are certainly learning a lot from the various partnerships that we have around the world. With respect to chocolate in China, we have studied this for quite some time. The Chinese consumers love brands with personality. We've done a lot of testing with the consumer, and our Milka bundle is a very unique bundle. The purity of Alpine milk together with some of the assets that you're familiar with, the Lila cow, for example, are really positive with the Chinese consumer. And we have every expectation that we can actually bring growth back to this market with the launch of Milka. Jonathan Feeney - Consumer Edge Research LLC : Great, thanks very much. Brian T. Gladden - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Jonathan. Operator : Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker) John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC Operator : Good morning, and welcome to Mondelez International Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Mondelez management and the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondelez. Please go ahead, sir. Shep Dunlap - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Good morning, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Irene Rosenfeld, our Chairman and CEO, and Brian Gladden, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our earnings release and presentation slides, which are available on our website, mondelezinternational.com/investors. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we will be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures, unless otherwise noted. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation. Before we get started, please note one change in our non-GAAP measures. Consistent with majority of our peers, we're no longer electing to qualify commodity and currency-related derivatives for hedge accounting treatment. As a result, we've redefined our adjusted gross profit, adjusted operating income, and adjusted EPS measures to exclude gains and losses or mark-to-market impacts on commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives until the related inventory is sold. In doing so, we'll eliminate the mark-to-market volatility within our adjusted gross profit, adjusted operating income, and adjusted EPS results. For your reference, we've included a schedule in the appendix of today's slides with mark-to-market gains and losses that were reflected in adjusted operating income in prior periods for comparability. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Irene. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.: Thanks, Shep, and good morning. As you've all seen throughout the year, the macro environment remains challenging. Consumer demand across the globe has slowed, and we continue to deal with choppy conditions in some emerging markets. In the face of this slower growth environment, we've continued to deliver solid financial results. Through the first nine months, we've made progress in several areas. Although our top-line is not yet where we'd like it to be, year-to-date organic net revenue grew 1.6%, led by our Power Brands, which were up more than 3%. Importantly, these results reflect a steadily improving contribution from volume/mix. We've continued to aggressively reduce overheads, and improve the efficiency and cost structure of our supply chain, while making necessary investments to accelerate growth. As a result, we've been able to expand adjusted operating income margin by 260 basis points. What's more, we've increased adjusted EPS by 28% on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by operating gains. Brian will provide more detail on our Q3 performance in a moment, but I'd like to underscore a few highlights. As Tim Cofer, our Chief Growth Officer, shared at the Barclays Conference in September, we're focused on accelerating volume-driven revenue growth. Although there's still room for improvement, we're making progress as vol/mix turned positive in Q3, with solid contributions from North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific. Over the past seven quarters, we've delivered a better balance of pricing and vol/mix while increasing profitability. Going forward, we'll continue to invest to support this balance because it's critical to sustainable top-line growth. Our Power Brands delivered another solid quarter and, once again, outpaced category growth. We're pleased to see that our largest, most important brands continue to perform well, even in the face of challenging market conditions. On the bottom-line, we delivered another quarter of outstanding margin and earnings growth, with adjusted OI margin up 220 basis points, and adjusted EPS up more than 40% on a constant currency basis. Our year-to-date results position us well, not only for the balance of this year, but also as we progress toward our 2018 adjusted OI margin target of 17% to 18%. Finally, we remain committed to a balanced and disciplined capital deployment plan, one that drives long-term growth through reinvestment in the business while providing compelling capital returns to our shareholders. Year-to-date, we've returned $2.6 billion to our shareholders, including $1.8 billion in share repurchases. Looking ahead, we expect the environment to remain challenging, but we will continue to deliver our financial commitments by maintaining focus on what we can control, and by executing the three pillars of our growth strategy. First, as we contemporize our core, we're increasing A&C support behind our Power Brands, selectively investing in trade to narrow price gaps, sharpening connections with our consumers through digital marketing, and innovating to redefine permissible snacking. This is playing out in our improving vol/mix and solid performance of several key Power Brands. For example, Oreo, belVita, and Milka, all posted mid- to high-single-digit growth year-to-date, and we have solid momentum behind our Thins biscuit platform, which includes innovations like Oreo Thins and Chips Ahoy! Thins on the sweet side and GOOD THiNS and Ritz Crisp & Thin on the savory side. Second, we're filling key white spaces by establishing beachheads in key markets. We recently launched chocolate in China, where initial response to our Milka bundle has been very positive. We're also launching Mainstream and Premium Chocolate in the U.S., where we believe the Oreo and Green & Black's brands will resonate well with consumers. We acquired the license to sell Cadbury branded biscuits around the world. This will enable us to grow our Cadbury choco-bakery portfolio in more than 100 markets. And in Japan, we launched Oreo, Ritz, and Premium biscuits in September, following the repatriation of our brands there. These white space opportunities will unlock sizable incremental growth in the near-term beyond our current run rates. And third, we're continuing to drive selling and channel ubiquity by expanding our routes to market and improving in-store execution. This includes a significant focus on e-commerce, which grew approximately 40% in Q3. Of course, given the challenging macroeconomic conditions, we're being quite selective with our investments. This helps balance margin expansion with revenue growth, both short and longer term. Net, we remain confident that a focused and disciplined growth strategy, our strong record of delivering cost saving and margin expansion, together with our improving cash flow, will enable us to accelerate growth on both the top- and bottom-lines over the long-term and create significant value for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Thanks, Irene. Good morning, everyone. We performed well on a number of key measures in Q3, and again, delivered solid financial results. Organic net revenue increased 1.1%, despite the negative impact of approximately 80 basis points from our revenue management actions. Our Power Brands again drove our top-line, up 2.5%. And as Irene mentioned, we delivered another quarter of vol/mix improvement which drove almost half of the revenue growth. Emerging markets rose 2% due to currency-driven pricing and inflationary markets. Our developed markets increased 0.6%, driven by positive vol/mix, while also significantly expanding margins. Now let's take a look at our margin performance. We delivered another quarter of robust adjusted OI margin expansion. Our adjusted gross margin increased 30 basis points to approximately 40%. Continued strong net productivity drove the improvement, which was somewhat offset by higher trade and pricing investments in a few key markets. Adjusted OI margin was 15.8%, up 220 basis points. This improvement was driven by continued reductions in overheads as a result of zero-based budgeting and the expansion of global shared services. The margin improvement included a net benefit of approximately 30 basis points from certain non-core items such as VAT-related settlements, gains from the sale of property, and costs related to our U.S. labor business continuity planning. As Shep mentioned at the beginning of the call, these results now exclude the impact of mark-to-market, which was immaterial in the quarter. Making this change allows for some reduction in both complexity and cost, while providing investors with the same transparency of mark-to-market impacts. We continue to be pleased with our progress on the cost agenda and margin expansion. We're ahead of plan for the year, and we'll be even more aggressive in both overheads and cost reductions, given the more challenging top-line growth environment. At the same time, we're fully committed to support our Power Brands with increased A&C investment. In Q4, we expect to make additional investments to drive revenue and share growth as we head into 2017. Let me now provide some color on our performance by region. In North America, we delivered another strong quarter of margin expansion as adjusted OI margins improved by 220 basis points, primarily driven by continued overhead reductions and good net productivity. On the top-line, our North American business grew about 1%, driven by solid vol/mix. Biscuits growth was led belVita, Chips Ahoy!, Ritz, and Wheat Thins, which all posted solid gains. Despite soft gum and candy results, Sour Patch Kids delivered another strong quarter of growth while expanding share, and Stride posted double-digit growth following the brand's re-launch at the end of Q2. Europe also delivered another quarter of strong margin growth, with adjusted OI margin up 230 basis points to 19.7%. Productivity and lower overheads drove those gains. Organic net revenue was up 1%, primarily due to solid vol/mix. Biscuits posted significant growth, thanks to strong results in the UK and France. Chocolate growth in Germany was also a key driver. In EEMEA, market dynamics deteriorated, especially in the Middle East, as the Gulf States and Saudi Arabia deal with the ongoing pressures resulting from persistent low oil prices. As a result, organic revenue declined just over 1%, and adjusted OI margin decreased 100 basis points driven by lower volume leverage. We're planning for continued weak demand from the Middle East markets over the next few quarters. Once again, however, Russia was a relatively bright spot in the region, posting double-digit growth in biscuits and modest single-digit growth overall. Please take note that this will be the last quarter we talk about EEMEA, as we consolidate this region into our Europe and Asia Pacific businesses. Details of the change are provided in our second quarter and third quarter 10-Qs. In Asia Pacific, adjusted OI margins grew 340 basis points to 13.4%, driven by improved overheads and good productivity. Organic revenue increased 1.5%, primarily due to vol/mix improvements, as AP grew for the sixth consecutive quarter. India posted mid-single-digit growth, fueled in part by continued strength in chocolate, and the launch of Bournvita biscuits. Southeast Asia delivered good share momentum with solid top-line growth in both the Philippines and Vietnam. We continue to see great results from our Kinh Do acquisition as Vietnam delivered high-single-digit growth. Biscuits grew share by nearing two points. China declined slightly due to soft demand across most categories. That said, we continue to hold or grow shares across our categories and are encouraged by the early market feedback on our launch of Milka chocolate. In Latin America, adjusted OI margin increased 540 points to over 15%, primarily driven by the VAT-related settlement in the quarter. Excluding this settlement, margins still posted solid growth. Organic net revenue increased nearly 3%, led by Mexico and Argentina. Mexico grew mid-single-digits, driven by balanced vol/mix and pricing, while Argentina grew high-double-digit through pricing to offset currency-driven inflation. Consistent with our commentary from last quarter, Brazil continued to be difficult, as the economy remained in deep recession. Government austerity measures, tight credit conditions, and high unemployment are all weighing on consumption. We took actions to narrow price gaps in the quarter and we delivered modest growth in chocolate. We're being very selective to protect margins, but we're still seeing some down-trading, especially in biscuits. Unfortunately, we don't see any short-term catalyst for improvement in the Brazilian economy and are planning for this challenging situation to continue into at least the first half of 2017. Let me now spend a few moments providing some highlights on the category performance. In aggregate, category growth continued to slow in the third quarter, and is now at 2.6% on a year-to-date basis. While our growth has trailed categories overall, this is primarily due to our revenue management actions and reflects a conscious decision to forgo revenue with lower margins. Our biscuits business grew nearly 2%, with strength in the UK, the U.S., and Germany. Both belVita and Oreo continued to drive our biscuits results. The launch of Chips Ahoy! Thins in the U.S. also fueled the category. Three quarters of our revenue grew share. Chocolate grew 2%, driven by solid results in the UK, Germany, and India. More than half of our revenue grew share in this category. As we discussed at the Barclays event in September, we're launching chocolate in the U.S. and are encouraged by the initial customer feedback. A limited selection of products will be available in the market during the fourth quarter. This, together with our recent launch of Milka in China will begin to have a more material impact on revenue in Q4 and into 2017. Gum and candy increased just over 1%, led by solid performance in Mexico and the U.S. About half of our revenue in this category gained or held share. Turning to earnings per share, in Q3, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.52, which was up 42% on a constant currency basis. This growth was primarily driven by strong operating income, as well as lower taxes and continued solid results from our coffee equity investments. Moving to cash flow and capital return, as we highlighted in September, we continue to have a strong focus on improving our cash conversion cycle. To that end, in Q3, we generated approximately $500 million of free cash flow. Several factors such as improving margins, declining CapEx, lower restructuring charges, and improved cash conversion metrics put us in a good position to double our free cash flow in 2018. During the quarter, we returned more than $700 million of capital to shareholders, which brings us to $2.6 billion in capital return through nine months. To-date, we've repurchased approximately $1.8 billion of shares, at an average price of $41.64. We've now increased our target for share buybacks, and expect to repurchase approximately $500 million in the fourth quarter. Before I turn to the outlook, you likely saw that we launched a debt tender and also raised $3.75 billion in new notes last week. As you would expect, we're taking advantage of favorable market conditions, and very attractive pricing to lower our interest cost and increase our flexibility. This is expected to be debt neutral, as we intend to use the net proceeds from the issuance to fund all or a portion of the tender offer, while using the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes including funding near-term debt maturities. Now to the outlook. Given the slower category growth environment and more challenging conditions in emerging markets, we now expect full year organic net revenue to grow approximately 1.6%. This includes about 100 basis points from our revenue management actions. Underlying that revenue growth, we expect positive vol/mix in the fourth quarter and flat to slightly positive vol/mix for the full year. We remain on track to deliver our 15% to 16% adjusted OI margin target. We expect to achieve this while making additional growth investments in the fourth quarter to stage 2017. We're also increasing our EPS outlook for the year, which reflects our strong year-to-date performance. We now expect full year EPS to be up approximately 25% on a constant currency basis. And with respect to free cash flow excluding items, we continue to expect to deliver at least $1.4 billion for the year. So to wrap up, we feel good about our year-to-date performance, especially in light of the difficult macro backdrop. We're pleased with the improving quality of our top-line despite slower growth overall. Our vol/mix trends continue to demonstrate healthy improvement, including positive growth in Q3 and flat to positive growth for the full year. Our teams continue to deliver significant adjusted OI margin expansion, while increasing investments in our Power Brands. And we're making capital return a priority with $2.6 billion returned to shareholders year-to-date. Looking forward, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our commitments and remain on track to reach our adjusted OI margin target of 17% to 18% in 2018. As usual, we'll provide our outlook for 2017 during our Q4 earnings call. And with that, let's open it up for questions. Operator : The floor is now open for your questions. Your first question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, good morning, everyone. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.: Good morning, Bryan. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Good morning, Bryan. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I guess just wanted to follow-up on, in the course of the presentation you made a few references about, particularly in some of the emerging markets, just that the macro environment's pretty weak and also even the snack category growth, which I guess on slide eight, you've seen kind of the category decelerate. So can you \u2013 and I know it's a little early to talk about 2017, but can you just talk about how you're thinking about sort of the macro environment as you're planning for 2017? And also against that backdrop, what gives you the confidence that you get a little bit of improvement sequentially in sales growth for the fourth quarter given just that it seems like the environment may be even getting a touch worse? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.: Well, Bryan, first of all, we are not expecting a dramatic change in the macro backdrop and so we continue to plan our business accordingly. We're focused on what we can control. So we're going to continue to focus on our cost structure and making sure that our investments are being laser-focused on the places where we think we can get the best returns. That algorithm is working well for us, and we will continue to deploy that algorithm as we look into 2017. So we're not going to give you any guidance today, but I will tell you our playbook is going to look quite similar, where we're going to continue focus on our Power Brands and focus in those places for investment that we think we can get the best return while continuing to streamline our cost structure to drive our margin expansion. As we think about the fourth quarter, we are not expecting a real change in the base momentum of our business today, but we have a number of incremental initiatives that we talked about in the course of the conversation here. We're continuing the roll-out of China chocolate. We launched it in late Q3 and we'll get a benefit in Q4 and into 2017 from that roll-out. We'll start to benefit from the initial shipments related to our chocolate launch in the U.S. behind the Oreo and Green & Black's trademarks, as I mentioned. We're repatriating our Nabisco brands, particularly Ritz, Oreo, and Premium in Japan. That will be incremental to our base. So all of those actions, on top of our base momentum, is what gives us confidence that we will see some improvement in momentum as we exit the year. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Thank you. And can I just follow-up on this category slowing, is that more just macro like you've just got weakness in certain markets, so emerging markets, or is there something structural that's going on? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.: We don't see anything structural. There's no question in some of these markets, given our strong market positions, we have an obligation to fuel that growth of the category, and that's why we're continuing to make investments, we're continuing to focus our innovation pipeline on the launch of well-being products like GOOD THiNS and that is helping to stimulate market growth. But overall, the major factor is the macroeconomic backdrop, which clearly has a dampening effect on consumer demand. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Thank you, Irene. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Hi, Ken. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I just wanted to clarify, in Latin America, I think you said the margin improvement was mainly because of the VAT settlement in the quarter. Could you help us quantify exactly how much that helped? Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: In Latin America, it was fairly significant, it represents \u2013 and it'll be laid out in the Q, I think we give the dollars, actually. It's in the range of $30 million \u2013 $35 million of benefit for the VAT settlement. But the margins otherwise in LA [Latin America] were actually up year-over-year, excluding that. So there's good progress on that productivity as well as overheads in Latin America. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And is that a onetime thing or... Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yeah. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : ...Latin American VAT is not my expertise? Okay. Perfect. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: It is, yeah. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. And then, Irene, you said this morning that some of your revenue initiatives will lead to I think \"sizable\" incremental growth in the near-term. I'm just trying to figure out, you hopefully laid out some of the tailwinds, U.S. chocolate, Cadbury, biscuits, and I think the launch of some products in Japan. As you think about all of these, I guess which is the most important in terms of pushing your sales higher? I'm just trying to get a better sense of maybe the opportunity you see in each of these. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.: Well, certainly from a magnitude standpoint, China's the world's second largest economy so we feel very good about, very bullish, about the launch of chocolate in China. We have had very strong results from our launch of gum in China. It's over $200 million business today. We only launched it two years ago or so. So that's probably the biggest. But the U.S. is the largest chocolate market in the world, and we think we're well positioned with a mainstream offering in terms of the Oreo chocolate and then a premium offering under the Green & Black's trademark. That will be offered both online and in e-commerce, and we have \u2013 we think those can be sizable additions to the portfolio. So those would be the two biggest on the incremental side. And then certainly, as we enter 2017, we'll share with you our innovation pipeline for 2017, but we've got some very strong contributors there as well. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thanks, Irene. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning, everybody. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Hey, Andrew. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.: Hey, Andrew. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Just two questions, if I could. First, just with respect to mark-to-market, I guess, maybe what drove the timing to make that adjust this quarter as opposed to, like, at the end of the year, let's say? And then, given, I think, the mark-to-market was a headwind of about $50 million on a year-to-date basis, I guess can you confirm that the full year margin guidance would still apply even if the mark-to-market was still included? First question. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yeah. Yeah, it does. I mean, it was never contemplated. I mean, we always assumed zero in our guidance for mark-to-market and then you get quarter-to-quarter volatility, and then sometimes year-over-year, obviously, volatility. Year-to-date, it basically creates 30 basis points of favorability by excluding mark-to-market, so it's been a headwind of 30 basis points. The timing, I would say, Andrew, I mean, it's something we've been looking at and benchmarking. I think \u2013 we thought about the timing. The reality was it was relatively minor in the quarter, relatively minor for the year. As we think about places where we're putting hedges on for longer periods of time, it just got to the point where the volatility has increased over time. It has been more pronounced over the last year or so. And it just seemed like the right time to do it. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Okay, thanks for that. And then on gross margin, I guess, margins didn't expand on the gross margin side as much as we had modeled in the quarter. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yep. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And I guess with all of the supply chain productivity that's really building and starting to come through, in theory a lot more powerfully, I guess I was surprised by that. And so I'm trying to get a little more clarity on that. Was it just the trade spending that you talked about? Is that still an impact that we'd see in the fourth quarter? And is there any change to sort of the expectation of getting to 42% to 43% gross margins by 2018? Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: No, look, I think \u2013 so, it was 30 basis points in the quarter. It's up 110 basis points year-to-date. It will continue, Andrew, to be a big driver of margin expansion delivery for us, and feel good about the supply chain reinvention plans. Net productivity execution continues to be very strong. We gave you a range for how we're executing there. And I would just say we continue to see a lot of runway into 2018 and beyond with the supply chain and gross margins. So there were several areas where we invested trade spending, adjusted pricing, really trying to balance growth in margin, given competitive environment. Over time, as our algorithm, as we've said, we think we can manage pricing net of commodities to the point with where we can drop through productivity and allow pricing net of commodities to be about flat. But that'll be over time and it won't be linear. It will vary quarter-to-quarter. I think that's what you're seeing. Feel good about the overall margin delivery, offset some of the gross margin challenge with SG&A, and delivered. We're up year-to-date 260 basis points on OI. So we tend to think about it that way. It will vary, it will be a little bit lumpy and we feel good about the execution on supply chain. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thanks very much. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Thanks, Andrew. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Growe of Stifel. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.: Hi, Chris. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. I just wanted to ask first, if I could, as you think about some of the activities around revenue management this year, I guess without getting into guidance, is the expectation that those will not continue in 2017? So hopefully your growth is more like your categories in 2017? Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: That's what we've been saying, Chris. I think that's still true. We are continuing our work on trade optimization and learning more there. I think we still have opportunity there. It will be a little bit of a headwind. SKU reductions and overall pruning, I think, has tailed off a bit, pardon the pun. But it ultimately is one where I think we're in a position where that will be a smaller impact as we head into next year and we'll update you on that in February. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And I may have missed it in your remarks, but I just want to understand, the third quarter is supposed to be a quarter where you had a larger increase in A&C spending, and then less so on the fourth quarter. Is that the way it worked out? Because you also mentioned you were going to increase that in the fourth quarter as well. Just trying to get, like, order of magnitude or how it may be different from what you thought before. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.: No, it's playing out pretty much the way we had thought, Chris. We're spending about 9% of revenue, and given the market conditions, we're being quite selective in where we spend that money and certainly within the mix we're paying a lot of attention to making sure that we're spending behind our Power Brands and the places we can we think we can get the best return. And within A&C, we're putting a lot more emphasis on advertising rather than consumer promotion. And within advertising, we're shifting more to digital around the world. So, net, is the mix of that spending is looking a little different. The magnitude of the spending is essentially what we thought, at about 9% of revenue, and you will see that play through into the fourth quarter as well. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: And, Chris, when you look at the magnitude of the white space launches, whether it's chocolate in China or the U.S., or even Japan, I mean, those are places that are going to require some incremental investment as we head into the fourth quarter. So that's one of the drivers as we talk about the incremental investment in Q4. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you for the time. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yep. Operator : Your next question comes from Matthew Grainger of Morgan Stanley. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Hey, Matt. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Brian, first I just had a follow-up on gross margin. How would you characterize where you stand right now in terms of generating a sufficient level of volume to be able to really effectively realize the full margin benefits of the Lines of the Future? And is the slowing category growth outlook going to be a constraint in that respect as you try and move up toward that 42% to 43% target? Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yeah, Matthew, I would just say, it is a challenge, it is something that we, obviously, are dealing with. And you heard me call it out in region performance, and it's affected Latin America and EEMEA, most recently in the last quarter, the volume leverage. But I would just tell you that the supply chain team is adapting the plans. We've pulled CapEx, as we talked to you about in September; that was volume-related out in many cases, redeployed that in additional programs that are more focused on getting cost out and delivering the benefits. So I think it's \u2013 yeah, it's a pressure, but I would tell you that our team is reacting, and we're refocusing the plans where we can see the benefits. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.: The other thing I'd say, Matthew, is just like in A&C, we're continuing to distort those investments to the places where we think we can get the best return. So most of our Lines of the Future are for our Power Brands, which, year-to-date, are growing over 3% in excess of our categories. And so, that's the reason why we will continue to disproportionately focus our attention and our investments on those Power Brands, because they are inherently advantaged. And as we then start to produce them on Lines of the Future, they're even more advantaged. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks. And, Irene, I also wanted to \u2013 sorry \u2013 come back to the issue of price gap management and some of the tactical trade promotion that you've been doing. You've been fairly vocal about U.S. biscuits in Brazil, but are you seeing similar dynamics in any specific markets or categories in Europe and Asia, given that we did see some price deceleration in those regions as well? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.: No, I would say, those are the two most pronounced. And again, we're continuing to see the reality that that investment does not necessarily stimulate category growth. And so, over time, we are continuing to invest in the underlying equity of our franchises, even in those markets, because that is really the way to drive long-term category growth. Particularly in markets like our emerging markets, one of the benefits of our supply chain reinvention, aside from recapitalizing onto or capitalizing onto more efficient assets is the flexibility that they give us to be able to make packages of different sizes. And that's been an important tool in our arsenal as we seek to make sure that we're providing adequate value on our brands. So that's how we're managing it. And, again, I think as you see the results, we're starting to see vol/mix. We're pleased to see vol/mix playing a more important role and a positive role, both in this quarter and then certainly as we look at the full year. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Thanks again, Irene. Operator : Your next question comes from Alexia Howard of Bernstein. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good morning, everyone. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Hey, Alexia. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: In the gross margin year-on-year change, you talked about how it looks a lot better on a constant currency basis. Could you talk about what the transactional headwinds have been in there and whether those are expected to persist? And then as a follow-up, how quickly are you expecting to ramp-up distribution on the chocolate in the U.S. market? And how early in 2017 do you expect the broad-based marketing campaign to start? Thank you. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yeah, I'll take the first part. I think gross margins in general, currency this year has been a bigger impact for us than commodity. That's forced us, in some cases, to price, and that's created some of the challenges we've talked about in a couple of the emerging markets. But I would say, for the most part, it's moderated. The UK continues to be a bit of an outlier with the recent Brexit impact, and we're working our way through that. We're pretty balanced, though, as you look at the UK, as I said, in the second quarter, our exposure on the transaction basis in the UK is balanced, given we have production. Quite a bit of our supply comes out of the UK and is based in local currency. So for the most part, that's not as significant as you might expect. We do also then buy a lot of our cocoa in British pounds and that as well has created a bit of a cushion for us in other parts of the global business. So that said, cocoa in the recent weeks and even a couple of months has actually inflated a bit in U.S. dollars. And if that persists, that will be a challenge for us as we move forward, we'll have to monitor and manage that as we move into 2017. But I think, for the most part, in gross margin we've done a reasonable job this year balancing the impact of transactional currency and pricing appropriately in key markets. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.: As we think about the chocolate support, Alexia, we're just turning on the support in China right now, as I mentioned, we're just shipping the bulk of our inventory into our customers. The U.S. support is actually going to be more into 2017. I'm not going to tell you exactly when because I think our competitors would love to know the answer to that. But it is a big piece of our plan for next year, and an important part of our confidence about the incrementality of the opportunity. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey, good morning, folks. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Hey, Jason. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you for the question. Brian, you mentioned improving cash conversion metrics on the forward. You guys have been holding me on the line on your free cash outlook for the year. As you mentioned in September, you took down your CapEx outlook and certainly today your EPS outlook implies a more robust net income figure. So I guess my question is, where is the cash leakage on that? Net income's going higher, CapEx is going lower, but free cash flow's kind of flat lining. Why aren't we seeing better conversion on this? Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: I think the simple answer, I mean, clearly it's a year where we're maxing restructuring spending. This is the peak year along with last year and next year that will begin to go down, Jason. That's probably the biggest. We have said at least $1.4 billion; I think we're encouraged with the progress. We're a bit above our own expectations on cash conversion cycle year-to-date. So we'll see how it plays out in the fourth quarter. As you know, it's a big load of cash that comes in in the fourth quarter given the linearity of the business. So we'll see. But we're feeling good about it. And as I said, cash conversion cycle's ahead of plan, even our internal plans. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, got it. That's helpful. And one more and I'll pass it on. Just in terms of the tax outlook, it looks like you've kind of tweaked it down a little bit, not as big as maybe I thought it would be at first blush from the release this morning. How sustainable is it or should we be sort of wary of a potential tax rate step-up in the future? Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yeah, based on all we know, I mean, we're saying about 20% (39:20) for the quarter. It implies something in the low- to mid- 20%s (39:24) for the fourth quarter. We haven't changed our long-term guidance which is in the mid- 20%s (39:29). And I think that's just, over time, the mix of business evolves and some tax statutes expire that have given us a bit of an advantage. So we'll manage it. You have discrete items. We had a significant number of discrete items in the quarter around the U.K. and Europe and in Latin America \u2013 more than we would typically have \u2013 that drove the lower rate. So nothing's really changed, I would say, Jason. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. That's helpful. Thank you, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from David Palmer of RBC Capital Markets. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Hey, David. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Sorry about that, I was on mute. Just to follow up on promotion spending. It looks like trade investment is having modest volume payoffs, but it's offsetting some of that other revenue management benefits that you're getting to pricing and gross margins. What's been your self-grade on the revenue management that you're deploying, including the recent promotion efficiency? Has it been worth it, some of these reinvestments? And then what should we be looking for in terms of the cross currents to gross margins from that trade spend? Thanks. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yeah, again, I break it into the three pieces. I mean, the SKU rationalization and pruning, and in some ways walking away from very low margin business. Obviously, that's helped us contribute to the margin expansion. It's been an element of that margin progress. Revenue management itself and the trade optimization piece of that, I would say, we're still making progress in the early phases of that. We're focused on 10 markets where the majority of our revenue is. And the majority of our trade spending, we've resourced it appropriately. We're finding opportunities to spend our dollars more effectively. To be honest, we're finding opportunities to actually grow revenue by appropriately allocating those dollars and distorting those dollars. The analytics have proven to be incredibly powerful, and the centralization and aggregation of that data is very powerful. So I think that will continue to be something that we resource and build into our plans for next year. It is mixed. It will have some pressure on revenue in some markets, and as I said, with the optimization of promotional spend, we can actually see upside in revenue and margin. But as I said in the earlier question, the pruning and SKU rationalization related to supply chain reinvention is, I would say, it's diminishing. It's getting smaller. So as we head into next year \u2013 and you asked about the trend, I think it will be less of a negative impact for next year. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.: Mostly, David \u2013 facts are a very powerful thing, and so as we go to our customers with the data on ROI related to the spending with them, we have a much easier conversation, a much better story, and we're working together because both of us want to get better returns for the money that's being invested. So it's actually making for a much more robust conversation. And as Brian said, we're really getting a lot of learning as we get into this. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Just a follow-up comment is that some companies and consultants are increasingly sharing this dream that better analytics are now coming about that you can shift the spending from lower ROI promotions to higher ROI, and with some lead-time, you may not have that volume trade-off that more blunt shifts have made in the past. I don't know if you believe that, come 2018, say, or by 2018, you could be getting better at this, such that we see net revenue improvement without the volume hit. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yeah, we're seeing that, David. And there, clearly, are some areas where we have low hanging fruit. I would say, the developing markets, the emerging markets which still have a fair amount of trade spend, that's where it's toughest, because the data is hardest to get at. But some of the more developed markets \u2013 what you're saying makes sense, we're going to find areas of distorting spend and moving it to the right places, improves the ROI and could be in that positive on the top-line. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Steven Strycula of UBS. Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : Hi, and good morning. Question for Brian. I wanted to get a sense of how we should think about the split of margin expansion in the fourth quarter between gross and SG&A, just because the last two quarters we've seen a little bit heavier lean on SG&A for expansion. That question, and then I have a follow-up. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yeah, I guess, Steven, I'd go back. I mean, when we talked, I guess it was at CAGNY, we said longer term the biggest lever from here to our targets in 2018 is really gross margin. We would say that's still true. The work that we're doing, the line of sight we have, the programs in place, getting to the Lines of the Future targets we talked about \u2013 we're at 50 today and we've still got more to do. That's absolutely where we're headed. I would say, in the short-term, the trend you're seeing right now is probably more consistent with what you'll see, that it'll be a mix. It will be \u2013 no one quarter is going to be easy to sort of predict, and we're not going to provide that level of granularity. But I think you'll see more SG&A and a little bit less on the gross margin in the fourth quarter. Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : Great. And how should we think about the cadence or the growth rate of U.S. or North American business, just given that biscuits were a little bit weaker in the second quarter, feels like it got a little bit better in the third quarter, and we're just lapping a really challenging year-over-year comparison in the fourth quarter. So just trying to think through how much is self-control, how much is a little bit of new innovation kicking in against a tough comp. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.: We actually think, Steven, a lot of it is under our control. Historically, the category has benefited from our innovation and from the muscle of our DSD selling organization. And we're \u2013 we believe that continuing to innovate, support the franchises, and leverage our DSD muscle is going to allow us to get that category growing again. So we've got a sizable amount of continued A&C investment. We're continuing to innovate behind ideas like GOOD THiNS and belVita Bites and Chips Ahoy! Thins, which are driving some very nice incremental growth. And good programming with our retail partners. And so together, we would expect that to help bring that category back to a more robust rate of growth. Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Thanks, Steven. Operator : Your next question comes from Rob Moskow of Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hi... Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Hi, Rob. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): ...Irene and Brian. had a question about the gap between your margins in developed markets versus developing markets. You've boosted \u2013 most of the margin improvement has come from North America and Europe, now at 20%, and the developing markets are in the low-10%s and maybe teens, but I'm just wondering, if you think back today versus maybe a few years ago, do you feel like you still have the same pricing power in those developing markets, given the slowdown in macroeconomic conditions? Maybe the competition has gotten tougher, and what do you think you have you to do in order to boost margins in those markets, given also the investment needs for growth? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.: So, Rob, we still are getting good pricing, not as much as we were able to in the emerging markets, but the truth of the matter is that our revenue growth in the emerging markets, as Brian mentioned, were up about 2%. About five points of that is pricing. And so we're continuing to get pricing in these markets. As I mentioned earlier, we're looking to be a lot smarter in how we execute that pricing, looking much more to use price pack architecture, smaller sizes, economy sizes to deliver that pricing. And so, we're still getting pricing. The facts are, if you look at our margin performance for our emerging markets, we're getting up to the level of our peers. There continues to be an important component of overhead scale leverage there, so that it's critical for us to fuel the growth there to be able to leverage and amortize that infrastructure. And certainly in our developed markets, we're \u2013 in Europe, I think we're probably among the top of our peer group. In the U.S., we're getting much more in that top quartile. So, I think our margins, overall, in aggregate we've made sizable margin expansion, 220 basis points in the quarter, 260 basis points year-to-date. And it's coming from a balance of the work that we're doing in both our developed and our emerging markets. And, again, pricing is \u2013 we feel quite confident in our ability to price smartly in these emerging markets, and the results you're seeing reflect that. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: And there's a bit of a structural question around \u2013 as you look at the initiatives, the transformation work, whether it's supply chain reinvention, whether it's shared services, I mean, we sequence a lot of that activity and effort on the larger opportunities in the developed markets. So they're a bit behind in terms of executing on transformation, some of that margin expansion opportunity is still to come. And, as you know, we've invested, in many cases, ahead of the growth and we've chose to stick with those investments and count on the fact that those emerging markets will come back and be a nice lever for us when growth returns. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Thank you. Operator : We have time for one more question. Your final question comes from John Baumgartner of Wells Fargo. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks for taking the question. Irene, I'd like to ask about your vision for profit contribution in the emerging markets maybe a bit differently. I think the year-to-date expansion has been pretty striking and it seems to be maybe evolving a bit different relative to your base plan a few years ago, which rested more on holding margins flat and driving profit through a faster top-line. I mean, assuming the category growth does remain challenged, how are your options now evolving to address the cost base and overheads in LatAm and EEMEA going forward? Maybe follow Asia's lead. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.: Very good question, and that's exactly what our intent is, is a lot of the tools that are our Asian team is using are available in our other regions. We start with EEMEA is inheriting some of the business. We announced that we're breaking up our EEMEA region, putting some of the business into Asia Pacific and some of the business into Europe, and that will inherently give us much more leverage on the Middle Eastern business and the Africa business and the Eastern Europe business. That is a part of that. So that will help actually both Europe and Asia Pacific, and basically we'll see progress there. With respect to Latin America, a lot of the tools that we're using, the base productivity shifting our product mix, very disciplined focus on overheads are the same tools that we're using and those will continue to be available in Latin America. And we're going to use those as we continue our margin expansion there. So the work that we've done in \u2013 we're very pleased with the progress we've made in Asia Pacific. A lot of it is using the very same tools that we've used elsewhere in the world, zero-based budgeting, focusing on streamlining our overheads, as Brian mentioned, moving to shared services which actually will start to affect the emerging markets more in a more pronounced way as we head into 2017. So we see the opportunities in our other emerging market geographies, similar to what we've done in Asia Pacific. But we're very pleased with the performance in Asia Pacific. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thank you, Irene. Operator : With that, we thank you for your participation in today's conference. This concludes today's call.

David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC Operator : Good evening, and welcome to Mondel\u0113z International's 2016 Fourth Quarter and Full Year Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Mondel\u0113z management and the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondel\u0113z. Please go ahead. Shep Dunlap - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Thank you, and good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Irene Rosenfeld, our Chairman and CEO; and Brian Gladden, our CFO. Shortly after market closed today, we sent out our earnings release and presentation slides, which are available on our website, mondelezinternational.com/investors. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we will be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures, unless otherwise noted. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation. Before we get started, I have one comment regarding the timing of our calls. Based on investor feedback from recent surveys, we plan to hold our earnings calls after market close going forward. We heard from many investors who would prefer not to have the call during market trading. This new timing allows additional time to digest results and provide commentary prior to the next day's market open. And, with that, I'll now turn the call over to Irene. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Thanks, Shep, and good afternoon. As you read news from around the world these days, it's clear that an unprecedented number of economies are facing significant disruption and uncertainty. Slower GDP growth, currency and commodity volatility, the uncertain impact of the Brexit vote, market shocks like the recent demonetization in India, and complex developments in the political landscape, including a backlash against globalization. The impacts from these events are being felt across many companies and industries, and we're not immune. We're dealing with these realities with a sense of urgency : to control what we can and create contingencies for what we can't. Before diving into our results, I'd like to take a step back to underscore our approach for long-term value creation in today's uncertain world. Our strategy is guided by the belief that the best companies have been and will continue to be those with the brands, platforms, and capabilities to create long-term value for shareholders, by delivering sustainable growth on both the bottom and the top lines. We continued to improve operational efficiencies throughout our business, expanding margins and focusing on delivering consistent returns to shareholders by growing our bottom line. In fact, over the past four years, we've delivered double-digit compound growth in adjusted EPS at constant currency. Few of our competitors have done that. But we also recognize that great companies simply cannot cut their way to long-term growth, and so we haven't lost sight of the need to invest in our business, to support sustainable top line growth. While we're encouraged by our results in 2016, we acknowledge that our top line is not yet where we want it to be. Some of this is due to factors outside of our control, some is due to mixed execution on our part, and some reflects deliberate actions we've taken to run a more profitable business. So with that as context, let me discuss our 2016 performance. In the fourth quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.47, up 12%; adjusted OI margin expansion of 110 basis points; organic revenue growth of only 0.6%, reflecting the significant impact from India demonetization and selected market contractions. Our Power Brands grew nearly 2%, which outpaced category growth, and we returned $1.1 billion to our shareholders. For the full year, we delivered adjusted EPS growth of 24%, at constant currency; strong adjusted OI margin expansion, up 230 basis points, fueled by significant net productivity and overhead savings; organic growth of 1.3%, including the impact of approximately 110 basis points from revenue management and India demonetization. Once again, our Power Brands grew above category rates, up nearly 3%, and we returned $3.7 billion to our shareholders. We achieved these results despite the current market realities. For example, in the UK and India, two markets with good momentum through the first half, extraordinary events like Brexit and demonetization muted the impact of our investments. And in Brazil and U.S. biscuits, two highly competitive markets, our trade spending in the quarter did not deliver the volumes we expected. In Brazil, macroeconomic headwinds depressed demand for biscuits and led to significant down-trading by consumers. And in the U.S., aggressive spending by a key competitor failed to provide any uplift in growth, and simply compressed margins. From time to time in the short term, we will choose to defend our share in response to specific competitive actions. Over the long term, however, we're far more focused on growing our share and our categories through brand equity, innovation, and price pack architecture. And that's where we're making most of our investments. So despite some puts and takes on the top line, we continue to grow. And on the bottom line, we're significantly expanding margins and delivering sizable returns to our shareholders. As we've outlined before, our strategy is built on three pillars : investing for growth, reducing costs, and focusing our portfolio. We'll have more time to update you on our progress at CAGNY, but let me quickly give you some 2016 highlights. Disciplined investing for growth remains critical to our strategy. As Tim Coffer, our Chief Growth Officer, outlined last September, our growth plan is focused in three areas. First, contemporizing our core business to ensure that our portfolio remains relevant to today's consumers. This includes increasing resources and investment behind our Power Brands, our largest and most profitable trademarks, which represent nearly 70% of our revenues. This focus is paying off. In 2016, our Power Brands continued to outpace category growth, led by Oreo, Milka, and belVita. Second, we're adding to the core by filling in key white spaces, by bringing our Power Brands to growing markets and usage occasions where we're underrepresented today. We're seeing early success from our launches of Milka chocolate in China, and the repatriation of our Nabisco biscuit trademarks in Japan, and we just entered the U.S. chocolate market with Milka Oreo and GREEN & BLACK'S. We're also addressing consumer white spaces, the most significant of which is the shift toward well-being. GOOD THiNS and belVita Soft Bakeds are two examples from our strong innovation pipeline, and GMO-free triscuit is one of our most recent examples of brand renovation. Third, we're expanding sales and distribution capabilities to ensure that our products are available wherever and whenever people shop. In the online arena, which is a small but growing channel for snacks, as consumers increasingly choose to shop online, we're building an industry-leading eCommerce snacks business, targeting at least $1 billion in revenue by 2020. Despite our overall reduction in overheads, we've invested to build a dedicated eCommerce team and to enhance our supply chain capabilities in this space. These efforts are already paying off as our eCommerce business grew more than 35% on a reported basis in 2016. While we continue to invest to drive the top line, given today's market realities, we've sharpened our focus even more on reducing costs. And you can see the impact on our expanded margins, as cost consciousness has become part of our DNA. Our supply chain reinvention program, now in its fifth year, is delivering strong net productivity, and we still have a long runway of opportunity ahead of us, especially as we put more of our Power Brands on to advantaged assets and continue to leverage our integrated Lean Six Sigma tools. To aggressively reduce overheads, we've actively embraced Zero-Based Budgeting. Over the past three years, our ZBB initiative has saved over $0.5 billion in indirect costs. We're also building a global shared services capability, which leverages our scale to simplify and standardize key back-office processes. These supply chain and overhead benefits will continue to build over the next couple of years. As a result, we're well on track to deliver our adjusted OI margin target of 17% to 18% by 2018. And we have good visibility to expand margins beyond that. Finally, we continue to take actions to focus our portfolio, so resources can be deployed to the highest return opportunities. Most recently, we announced an agreement to sell most of our grocery business in Australia and New Zealand, including the VEGEMITE brand. At the same time, we're strengthening our portfolio through bolt-on acquisitions in growing markets and consumer segments. For example, we've successfully integrated the Kinh Do snacks business that we acquired in 2015, enabling high single-digit growth in our Vietnam business. And in our allergy-friendly Enjoy Life Foods business, also acquired in 2015, we've expanded capacity and flexibility, with the opening of a new U.S.-based manufacturing facility in Indiana. This increased capacity enabled our recent expansion into the UK and Australia. To summarize, 2016 was another solid year for our company. Despite the significant headwinds, we delivered adjusted EPS growth of 24% at constant currency; strong adjusted OI margin expansion, up 230 basis points, while returning $3.7 billion to our shareholders. With that, let me turn the call over to Brian to review our fourth quarter and full year performance in more detail. Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Great. Thanks, Irene, and good afternoon. Overall, we performed well on a number of key metrics for the full year, and delivered solid results in light of the challenging environment that Irene just referenced. While the external environment was definitely more difficult than we planned coming into 2016, we made great progress in driving strong margin expansion and cash flow, despite the weaker top line. Organic net revenue increased 1.3% for the year. This included the negative impact of 20 basis points from India demonetization and 90 basis points from our revenue management actions, which you'll recall include SKU rationalization, portfolio pruning, and trade optimization. While these actions do temper growth on the top line, they improved the overall quality of our portfolio, allowing us to focus on more attractive and higher-profit opportunities. Our Power Brands continued to be the primary driver behind our growth, as they finished up nearly 3% for the year, exceeding category growth rates. Emerging markets increased 2.7%, due primarily to currency-driven pricing in inflationary markets, while developed markets grew 0.5% driven by positive vol/mix. Vol/mix was approximately flat for the year when excluding the impact of the India demonetization, with the second half stronger than the first. This is also a significant improvement from 2015, when vol/mix was a negative 2.5 percentage points. For the quarter, organic revenue grew 0.6%, including Power Brands growth of nearly 2%. We saw good results in a number of our largest countries, including Germany, China, Russia, and Mexico. But overall revenue growth was lower than our expectations, as India demonetization had a negative impact of approximately 60 basis points, and we saw weaker category growth in U.S. biscuits, the UK, and across the Middle East. Now let's take a closer look at our margin performance. 2016 represented another strong year of adjusted OI margin expansion, as we march towards our 2018 goal of 17% to 18%. Since 2013, our adjusted OI margins are up nearly 500 basis points. Adjusted OI margin for the year was 15.3%, up 230 basis points and in line with our guidance. We increased adjusted gross margins by 70 basis points for the year, driven by very strong net productivity. We also delivered continued reductions in overheads, resulting from our Zero-Based Budgeting and global shared services. In Q4, our adjusted OI margin grew 110 basis points, primarily through overhead reductions. As we mentioned in our last call, we made incremental investments during the quarter in areas such as white space expansions in U.S. and China chocolate. We saw a small decline in adjusted gross margins, as strong productivity gains were more than offset by short-term trade investments. Overall, we're pleased with our margin results for the year, and remain very confident in our path to our 2018 target. We continue to run the business in a way that delivers strong margin expansion, while making critical investments behind key growth initiatives. Let me now provide some color on our performance by region. In North America, we delivered full-year adjusted OI margin expansion of 190 basis points, primarily driven by continued overhead reductions and strong net productivity. On the top line, North America grew 1.2%, fueled by solid vol/mix results. Biscuits growth was led by belVita, Oreo, Chips Ahoy!, and our Thins platform, which all posted solid results. Gum and candy remained soft from an overall category perspective, but Sour Patch Kids candy continued to gain momentum, posting strong growth for the full year. In Q4, and as expected, we saw a decline in adjusted OI margins due primarily to increased A&C, including investments in U.S. chocolate. Revenue in the quarter grew 0.4% due to weak gum performance and the competitive pressures in biscuits that Irene discussed earlier. Europe delivered strong margin growth for the year, with adjusted OI margin up 220 basis points to 18.3%. Productivity and lower overheads were the primary drivers of those gains. Organic net revenue continued to be positive, up 0.7% for both the year and the quarter, primarily driven by vol/mix. Biscuits delivered strong growth in Germany and Russia for both the year and the quarter, while chocolate turned in solid performances in Germany and the UK for the year. In EEMEA, 2016 adjusted OI margins grew 230 basis points to 12.1%, driven by reduced overheads and solid productivity. Organic revenue increased 0.5% for the year, with growth in Australia, China, and Southeast Asia. Fourth quarter organic revenue declined 1.2%, including the impact from India demonetization, which was an approximate $40 million headwind across all categories. Although we believe the worst of this impact has passed, we expect headwinds in the first quarter and potentially into Q2. We also saw a decline in the Middle East as the economic recession caused by low oil prices and tightening credit markets persisted. On the flip side, we saw growth in China from biscuits, as well as good initial results from Milka chocolate, including some favorable impact from the timing of Chinese New Year. Southeast Asia delivered a strong quarter with balanced results across all categories, and continued momentum with Kinh Do. In addition, we saw the expected uplift from our initial quarter of the Japan biscuit repatriation. In Latin America, adjusted OI margin increased 220 basis points to nearly 13% for the year, primarily driven by lower overheads, including VAT-related settlements as well as targeted pullbacks in A&C. Gross margins were pressured in the region as we saw significant volume reductions in our manufacturing plants. Organic net revenue increased nearly 5% for the year, led by Mexico and Argentina. Mexico grew mid single-digits, driven by balanced vol/mix and pricing while Argentina grew double-digits as a result of pricing to offset currency-driven inflation. Consistent with our commentary for the past several quarters, Brazil remains a challenging market. Government austerity, tight credit conditions, and high unemployment continued to temper consumption, causing consumers to trade down to lower-priced snacking options. We're pleased to see improving results on Brazil chocolate, however, as our price pack architecture efforts continued to gain traction. Although we continue to believe that Brazil will be a long-term growth engine for us, we expect the market to be challenged for the foreseeable future. Let me now make some comments around category highlights. In aggregate, snacks category growth continued to slow in the fourth quarter, contributing to a full-year rate of 2.3%. Our growth was lower in aggregate than our categories. This was primarily a result of our revenue management actions. Biscuits grew 1.8% with strength in the UK, Germany, Russia, and Southeast Asia. belVita and Oreo posted strong results for the year. We did marginally lose share in our large U.S. biscuits business in a challenging, competitive environment. This resulted in only 35% of our biscuits revenue growing or holding share for the year. Chocolate grew 2%, driven by solid results in Germany, the UK, and Australia. Despite a decline in Q4 from demonetization, India had a strong year. And although it's early, we're pleased with our results in China chocolate for Q4. Although the category declined overall, we achieved a 2% share and expected continued momentum in 2017. Approximately 60% of our chocolate revenue grew or held share. Gum and candy was slightly negative for the year. Solid performance in Mexico gum and U.S. candy were among the highlights. About half of our revenue in this category gained or held share. Now turning to earnings per share. For the year, we delivered adjusted EPS of $1.94, which was up 24% on a constant currency basis. This growth was driven by our strong operating income performance, as well as the impact from share repurchases and lower taxes. In addition, we continue to be very pleased by the performance of our coffee equity investments. In addition to being a highly attractive and value-creating transaction for us, we believe these investments are becoming more valuable as they execute well. Moving to cash flow and capital return, we generated approximately $1.6 billion of free cash flow in 2016, which exceeded our outlook. Our teams continued to make excellent progress in working capital, and we believe we're now approaching best-in-class performance here. As we've said in the past, our improving margins, lower CapEx, and a decline in future restructuring charges will position us well to deliver on our 2018 free cash flow target of approximately $2.8 billion. Q4 also capped off a strong year for capital return. For the year, we returned $3.7 billion to shareholders, representing more than 220% of our net earnings. We believe this is best-in-class among our peers. During the quarter, we returned more than $1.1 billion through repurchases and dividends. For the year, we repurchased approximately $2.6 billion of our shares, and our buyback actions reflect more than a 15% reduction of shares since the spin. Now let me share the key elements of our 2017 outlook. As Irene mentioned, our priorities and strategy remain unchanged. And as we look at the global landscape for 2017, we do expect continued economic and geopolitical uncertainties, especially in the emerging markets, but also in places like the U.S. We've built our plans for 2017 assuming that the category environment remains consistent with what we saw in the fourth quarter. We believe this is an appropriately conservative stance. Even in this slower-growth environment, however, we expect to deliver another year of strong margin expansion and exceptional EPS growth. Specifically, we expect full-year organic net revenue to grow at least 1%. This outlook is built on a category growth rate as we see it today, and includes both the benefit of new white space launches, as well as our continued revenue management efforts. I would also note that based on the timing of Easter, the Chinese New Year, continued effects of India demonetization, and the strength of our first quarter in 2016, we expect flat to slightly positive growth in the first quarter. We expect adjusted OI margin in the mid 16% range. We remain highly confident in our margin expansion execution. This outlook is based on continued progress in overhead reductions, strong net productivity, while supporting investments in our key growth initiatives and high return A&C. Overall, we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our target of 17% to 18% in 2018, and continue to see improvement opportunities beyond that. Finally, we're expecting double-digit adjusted EPS growth on a constant currency basis. This would give us a double-digit CAGR over five years. We know of few other companies in our space that are delivering that type of performance. I'll now turn it back to Irene for a few closing comments. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Thanks, Brian. Simply put, I firmly believe we're well-positioned today and for the future. Our industry has been undergoing a period of unprecedented change and heightened volatility, and we expect this to continue in 2017. Challenging times like these demand decisive actions with a focus on creating value, both now and for the long term. Our aggressive cost management is making us nimbler, more efficient, and more productive. At the same time, we're making smart, strategic investments in our core franchises that will pay dividends for many years to come. We're clearly seeing some green shoots of growth in the brands, channels and markets where we're investing. Of course, not everything will show results immediately or work as well as we planned, but we're not afraid to experiment and innovate in this tough environment. In fact, we believe that's the only way to create momentum in a rapidly-changing world. While we believe it's critical to manage for the long term, we're also very focused on creating value for our shareholders today, regardless of headwinds. And we've done that. What gets me really excited, though, is this : when the macro picture improves, and we're confident that it will, the foundation we're laying today positions our company to leverage the investments we've made over the years to deliver differentiated growth on both the bottom and the top line. With that, let's open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's presentation. The floor is now open for your questions. Our first question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Good evening, everybody, and thank you. Two for me, if I can. First, as you talked about your organic sales growth, a little bit lighter than usual, you discussed some of the headwinds. I guess, Irene, if you were maybe to size some of those headwinds, whether it's India, which you already did size, as I appreciate that, for us, competition in the U.S., global economic issues, which would you say were the most challenging in this period? And were there anything that came in, on the flip side, maybe better that you expected on that top line? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Yeah, Ken, I think we pretty much sized the main impacts without a doubt for us, given our strong presence in India and particularly our strong presence in rural India. Demonetization was a particularly significant impact. And as Brian mentioned, we expect it'll continue probably into at least through the first quarter, if not into a little bit of the second quarter. The other one really that was different than perhaps \u2013 a little tougher than we had expected was the strong promotion spending that we saw in both the UK and the U.S. There's a lot of trade spending dollars. It didn't do very much to drive the category and, in fact, all it did was sort of margin down the business. And again, we chose to participate in that to defend our shares, but that's not the right way to build the business for the long term. And I think as our customers experience the reality of that spending, we're going to be able to get back to a more disciplined focus on innovation and brand marketing and price pack architecture. So I would say those probably were the two biggest. Without a doubt, we continue to see a shift toward well-being products, and we are committed to participating in that shift. We saw strong performance from some of our own products like GOOD THiNS, like belVita, but we'll share with you at CAGNY our focus on really accelerating that growth, because that's where the consumer is going. So I think, without a doubt, the top line's not yet where we want it to be. I would say, though, in answer to your second question, there are some dynamics underlying the aggregate numbers that make us feel confident that we're going to start to see some improvement as we move ahead. The first is simply the quality of the revenue. We've told you that, over time, we were going to migrate from a very price-driven revenue profile to one more driven by vol/mix. And as you saw coming out of this year, we went from about minus 2.5% contribution of vol/mix last year to almost flat this year, and as Brian mentioned, we saw some nice improvement as the year progressed. We're very pleased with the performance of our Power Brands. They're 70% of the revenue today. Over time, as they continue to grow faster because that's where we're making our investments, we should see that growth pick up and they will be a larger portion of our overall portfolio. But they are growing faster than our categories and we expect that that will continue. As I mentioned, well-being products are performing well, and over time we've made a commitment that by 2020, half of our products will be in the well-being space. They're performing well, and you will see that continue to have a contribution. I feel good about the white space launches. We talked for a long time about the fact we were going to launch China chocolate, and you saw us launch chocolate in the U.S. We're feeling good. Those are early days, of course, but we're off to a good start there. And then last but not least, obviously we're seeing a fairly significant channel shift in a number of our markets, particularly the U.S. and China, and we've invested quite significantly in eCommerce and we're very pleased with the early progress in that space. We're up about 35% year-over-year, and we're hoping that that's going to represent a $1 billion business for us over the next couple of years. So net-net, we're not quite where we want to be on the top line. We're very pleased with the strong bottom line performance that we delivered. But we do see some green shoots underlying those aggregate numbers. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That's very helpful and thank you for all that. One quick follow-up for me : Some of your peers have quantified the benefit of the accounting change to stock-based comp on their earnings guidance this year. Just curious, to any degree, are you expecting this to help your earnings this year? Or is it too small to really think about? Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: I would say, Ken, it's in our outlook that we've provided. It's relatively small and, as you know, it's kind of hard to predict, but it's in there. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : All right. Thanks, Brian. Operator : Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Hi, Bryan. Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Hi, Bryan. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Just one question related to the margin outlook for 2017. Brian, can you talk a little bit about sort of where your outlook is for commodity cost inflation? And also, I guess, with revenues still sort of below average, just what kind of drag you're seeing from, like, volume deleverage? Just trying to get a sense for \u2013 even though you're sort of guiding to the mid 16% for margins, it just seems like there are still some headwinds there that you're fighting to get there, and I'm trying to get a sense for what those are. Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Yeah, Bryan, I would say commodities is a bit mixed. I mean, everybody have seen cocoa prices come down. And clearly, we will ultimately benefit from that. Obviously, we have a hedge program that cushions that and takes some of the volatility out. So we don't necessarily get it right away, and it'll play its way through. But there are other things that are up in that portfolio of commodities that we buy. So I would say it's a mixed bag and it's not necessarily as big a driver as it's been over the last few years from a commodity standpoint. That said, there's still markets where we have to price, and that's one of the key elements that's going to drive our performance as we move into 2017. So I think that's the fundamental view on commodities. I think when you look at overall margins, we are assuming a similar environment as to what we see now, and we've sort of, as you would expect \u2013 I mean, it's been a weaker volume year than we would have hoped, and we've delivered very strong productivity with all the work that we've done despite that. So we've built a plan to deliver on our 2017 commitments, assuming that we have a similar environment from a top line standpoint, and not much help from volume. It will be continued focus on the programs that are taking overheads and shared services, and we have to do a better job on trade optimization. Price pack architecture will be part of that that drives through our margins. And then we told you last summer that we're moving some dollars from CapEx, which were initially focused on capacity and driving growth. We've moved that into more restructuring, so that gives us more confidence and a bigger portfolio of programs that help us drive the margins in an environment like this. So I think we're adapting to plan and adjusting to an environment that has lower growth. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And, I guess, is that part of the visibility beyond 17% and 18% margins, once you get a little bit of volume back into the model, that ought to drive some leverage that isn't there today. Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Absolutely right. I mean, it changes the whole equation. If we were to get volume leverage on this thing, given what we've done with margins, it's a pretty powerful engine. Bryan Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Thanks, Bryan. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel Capital. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon. Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Hey, Chris. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Chris. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Maybe just to follow on Bryan's question there, just to be clear, do you expect then \u2013 I heard you talk about some pricing in some markets that's going to be sporadic, it sounds like. And how would that balance against volume growth? Do you expect volume growth for the year in 2017? Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: I think it feels a lot like what we saw this year, Chris. The pricing we need to do \u2013 I mean, there are some selected markets where it's rather extreme where we've seen devaluations in Egypt and Nigeria that has forced us to act very quickly with some significant pricing. But the rest of it \u2013 a lot of it will come from things like price pack architecture and revenue management. It won't be like we saw in 2015, which was broad-based across many markets. So that's just part of the equation that we've got to drive this year and I think we're in reasonable shape in terms of executing those things heading into the year. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then just a question for you on the gross margin. As we consider the supply chain savings coming through as well as some continued overhead cost control, can you give an idea of \u2013 I thought the savings would accrue more so to the gross margin in 2017. Is that true? And the gross margin was a little weaker than I thought in the fourth quarter, perhaps that's more volume and revenue-driven. Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: It is. I mean, gross margin has been and it'll continue to be a key driver, as we think about the margin expansion and the commitments we have. Supply chain execution has gone well. It does set us up for productivity as we move over the next couple of years. So, gross margin will continue to be important. And if volumes come back, it obviously is a much more significant driver. As you look at the fourth quarter dynamic on gross margin, we had very strong productivity, so I think the underlying performance was very good. We had a couple unplanned items. Obviously, the lost volume in some of these markets : India, Middle East, Brazil. We saw a few markets, as we said, that had extreme currency devaluations where you really can't price fast enough to catch up. And then the trade spending. I mean, those were the dynamics that played out across the gross margin line as you look at the fourth quarter. So it'll continue to be a driver. You can't count on it every quarter. It's going to be a little bit lumpy. But we feel confident in the initiatives that are going to drive gross margin expansion. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: So, for the year, could it be up in line with your operating \u2013 the expected operating margin expansion? Is that realistic? Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Yeah, I don't want to get into the individual line. We want to be held accountable for the OI margin expansion and we've got good plans to get there across both overheads and gross margins. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. That makes sense. Thank you. Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Thanks, Chris. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good evening, everybody. Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Hey, Andrew. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I guess, two questions, one just to finish up this gross margin conversation. I guess, the target I think that was thrown out maybe at CAGNY about a year ago was in 2018 I think gross margins of 42% to 43%. I guess, at this stage, it sounds like at least in this current volume environment, maybe it's slightly below that, maybe the SG&A piece around overheads and whatnot just picks up a little more steam as you lean in a little more heavily on that. Is that generally what you're sort of trying to get at? Or should we not abandon the 42% to 43% just yet? Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Yeah. Look, I think we'll talk a little bit about it at CAGNY this year. But it's clearly a different volume environment than we would've thought about, as we laid that out. So we'll give you a little bit of a sense for how we're thinking about that. I think you can have confidence that we have multiple paths to get there and we're chasing initiatives that are going to drive gross margin and overheads and the SG&A line. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then, Irene, I guess, a question that's relevant for Mondel\u0113z, but maybe a bit broader also and it's kind of relevant for the group as a whole. I'm trying to get a sense of, at what point, I guess, do sort of multi-year margin targets that not just Mondel\u0113z have put out, but others, maybe become a bit counterproductive. Maybe if those margins ultimately come on a sales base that maybe is much lower than planned. I guess, at some point, how do you balance the, hey, should we push out a margin target in order to make sure we kind of stabilize our sales base the way we need to. I'm just trying to get a sense in a broader sense of how you think about that. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: I do think our balance between top and bottom is one of the things that distinguishes us. I think we are uniquely well-positioned because of the nature of our portfolio, strong brands, a strong geographic footprint, strong routes to market with a good infrastructure, all of that is why we continue to make investment even in this challenging environment. So, without a doubt, we have pulled back a little bit. We've been pretty clear with our investors as to where those pullbacks have been, but we're one of the few companies that is delivering significant earnings growth while at the same time continuing to make those investments. And I think that is something that will continue to differentiate us, Andrew. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: See you in Florida. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: See you. Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: See you. Operator : Our next question comes from David Driscoll with Citi. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you and good evening. Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Hey, David. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: I wanted to ask about your thoughts here on this border-adjusted tax proposal. What do you assess that on your operations? And then kind of related to this, how much margin improvement is in your forecast from your Mexican/Salinas operations for the 2018 margin goals? Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Yeah. David, I mean, we obviously spend a lot of time talking about this. It's hard not to see it play out. But it's very difficult and I think in this discussion a little early to speculate on what it would mean to us in terms of the impact of a border adjustment tax. As you know \u2013 I mean, we are a very global company. We've structured it successfully in a way that allows us to run it efficiently and serve our customers, consumers around the world, while delivering strong returns. And this has enabled us to create a competitive and, I would say, advantaged global tax structure and low cash taxes as part of what we do in delivering our results. So, to directly really respond to the specific question, I would just say that we do import from Mexico and other parts of the world into the U.S. Our imports represent a minority of our U.S. revenues and profits. And as I said, we're not going to do anything to adjust our operations or plans until we really know what the policies are going to be, and they're much more concrete. So, I mean, we're very involved, we're watching developments. We've got a voice in this process of providing feedback. And to the extent that we face higher costs for imported products, we'd obviously need to look for ways to cover these costs, adapt our supply chain model. And we do that over time. So, in terms of how much incremental benefit associated with Mexico or Salinas, we are, I would say, fairly well utilized in that facility at this point. And we don't have right now at this point additional plans to move any additional production to Mexico. So I would say it's contributing. You've seen the results in North America in terms of our margin expansion. Obviously, that's part of it. And we have \u2013 it's important to note, we've made significant investments in our U.S. assets as well and we continue to make investments here. We've invested over the last few years over almost $0.5 billion in our existing U.S. manufacturing footprint in U.S. plants. So it's a mixed bag. And that has, David, contributed to the margin expansion as well. We've seen great margin expansion from the U.S. plants as well. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: So bottom line, would you say it's fair, though, that both Brexit and border-adjusted taxes kind of throw out some big questions about how it'll impact the company. But just right as of yet with no actual definition as to exactly what's going in, you can't really assess it right now, so you stick with your 2018 margin targets. Is that where we are? Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Yeah, look, I think it's a very global business with \u2013 for all the positive things that come from that, I mean, we've got exposures to some of these questions. We're watching the developments. We'll manage our way through it. And we will adjust as appropriate as we move forward. And we'll keep you posted as we learn more. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much. Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Thanks, David. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Good evening, folks. Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Hey, Jason. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you for letting me ask a question. Just a couple housekeeping items for me. I apologize if I missed it. Undoubtedly, I did miss it. But can you give us your expectation for all-in revenue growth in fiscal 2017? Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Well, we gave you organic net revenue of at least 1%, is what we said, Jason. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: No, no, I heard that. But there's FX and there's some other moving pieces. Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Yeah. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: What were your guidance \u2013 in terms of net sales, what your guidance is predicated on? Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Yeah. The other thing we provided in the release would have been 1% headwind from currency on the top line. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay, thank you. Sorry for the nuance question. Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Yep. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And the other housekeeping item, the VAT tax benefit, I think you mentioned that in your prepared remarks in terms of LatAm contribution to margins. How big was that? Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: We disclosed it in the third quarter. I think it was disclosed as about $35 million. We had an additional smaller amount in the fourth quarter. So I would say it's \u2013 we've had this over the last couple years from time to time. And it contributed in the LatAm business, I would say, about 80 basis points on the full year in terms of their profit. 80 basis points in terms of the \u2013 versus prior year. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. Okay, thank you. As promised, I was going to keep it short with the housekeeping. I'll pass it on. Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Yep. Operator : Our next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good evening, everyone. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Hey, Alexia. Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Hey, Alexia. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. Just two quick ones. Firstly, you alluded to promotional spending intensifying in the U.S. during this last quarter. I wasn't quite sure whether the idea was that it wasn't very effective and everybody's given up on it at this point, or whether it's likely to continue. That was the first question. And then the second one, I guess, linked, ad spend and consumer advertising spending, how much was that up year-on-year in the fourth quarter? What was the margin headwinds and how much more have you got to go in 2017 versus 2016? Thank you very much. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: So I would say it wasn't particularly effective, but that doesn't mean everybody will stop. So I can't forecast that. What I will tell you is we certainly are going to be a little bit more disciplined as we think about how we want to spend our money. Again, we did not see the kind of returns that we had hoped for and, in fact, it basically took our spending away from some of the other longer-term equity-building activities. So you're going to see us continue to migrate our spending. But I would say our customers, at the end of the day, if it doesn't grow the \u2013 if the spending that goes into it does not grow the category, I think our customers over time will look at other tactics as well. In terms of A&C in the fourth quarter... Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Yeah, I'll take it. I would say, Alexia, for the total year, essentially flat, at slightly above 9% I think as we've talked about. In the quarter, it was slightly down. I mean, we made some conscious decisions while we did invest in some key markets in the key white spaces. You think about India, you think about what happened in the Middle East, you think about some of the other markets where we saw challenges, we did pull back intentionally. So about flat for the year. As you know and we've talked about, we continue to mix towards digital, which has created for us more room and is cheaper obviously than traditional. We've benefited from some ZBB work here and we've also continued to distort to the Power Brands. So moving A&C and spending it in the right places I think we've gotten better at that. But in general, about flat. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And for 2017, pretty much the same? Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Yeah. I'm not going to provide specifics. I would say probably slightly up is the overall framework. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you. I'll pass it on. Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Our next question comes from Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. Thank you. I wanted to dive a little bit more into biscuits in the U.S. because this commentary came up in third quarter that competition had intensified and it sounded like Mondel\u0113z intended to do something about it. And with the Nabisco brand, you're obviously a big category leader. So what steps did you take to respond? And why do you think it didn't pan out the way you hoped for in fourth quarter? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Yeah, Rob, I would say we have made terrific progress in our U.S. biscuit business in terms of margin expansion over the last couple of years. If you look at North America, it's up 540 basis points, and that's almost largely the U.S. And that's been our primary focus. And at the same time, over these last couple of years, we've been able to continue to grow our share. This last year, the net of it is that we had a lot of moving parts going on in terms of our transformation activities, and I would say with hindsight, some of the optimization that we did, for example, in our DSD selling organization had more of an impact on the execution than I would have liked. And so we did see some impact in the short term. And as I mentioned in an answer to some of the earlier questions, we have seen a very challenging retailer environment, which has really caused a lot of promotional spending, which hasn't necessarily helped the overall category. Looking ahead, we have some very strong programs in place in 2017 and, frankly, a lot of those began as we exited the year. We're going to continue to invest in price pack architecture. As I've talked about it, as we got our supply chain \u2013 most of our supply chain activities behind us, we now have the capability and much more flexibility to offer a variety of pack sizes for our products. So, for example, we've got a family pack at one of our key customers that's doing exceptionally well. It took us a while to get that pack out the door. We are continuing to innovate, particularly in the well-being space. I mentioned GOOD THiNS and talked about the fact that you'll see a lot more of the items that we have coming in at CAGNY in a couple of weeks. And we're continuing to increase marketing investment behind programs with good ROI. We've got a very significant program behind our Oreo business this year, as well as a number of our other core franchises. So some of it was a messy fourth quarter that turned out to not play out quite as well as we had hoped, but at the same time, I think the business is well staged with one of the strongest innovation pipelines and the strongest price pack architecture capabilities that's going to allow us not only to address occasion opportunities, but also to penetrate some channels that we haven't been as strong in. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. It's late. I'll leave it there. Thanks. Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Thanks, Rob. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our allotted time for questions. Our final question will come from the line of Steven Strycula with UBS. Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Two quick questions for me. The first would be for Irene. Just on the non-Power Brands part of the portfolio, that's down 1.9% in the quarter. Can you kind of speak to whether the market share losses are more pronounced in this portion of the portfolio relative to Power Brands? And are we seeing just an under-investment in those pocket of brands right now because of where emerging markets stand today? Just any kind of forward-looking strategy about how we think about, that would be helpful. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Yes. Simple answer, Steven, is yes, Power Brands actually performed better in terms of overall market share. In fact, we actually grew share in Power Brands. So, some of the decline is coming from the non-Power Brands, but I would tell you that global Power Brands did exceptionally well. Our regional Power Brands was a bit of a mixed bag this past year because many of them are prominent in the emerging markets. So you think about a brand like Lacta chocolate in Brazil, for example, that given the macroeconomic conditions did not have a particularly strong year. So we did see some of these regional brands perform a little bit less well. But our focus going forward is to continue to distort our spending behind these Power Brands. They have the best margins. They've got the best growth trajectory. And that will allow us to continue to offset some of the declines in the other brands. Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, great. And then a follow-up for Brian. Brian, did you comment on what the SKU rationalization drag is going to be for 2017? And then lastly, should we think of equity income from JVs as up slightly from last year? Thanks. Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Yeah. In terms of equity income, I would assume we're planning on relatively close to what they did this year, maybe a little bit better, not significant improvement. They're facing into green coffee inflation, especially in Robusta. So it's a bit of a challenge that they're working through. And, Steven, what was your first? Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : The SKU rationalization drag for 2017. Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Oh, SKU rationalization, yeah. All I said and what we'll continue to say, it's smaller than we would have had in 2016 and we're not going to specifically break it out. Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, thanks. Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Great. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining Mondel\u0113z International's fourth quarter and year-end earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful afternoon.",

Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.: Thanks, Shep, and good afternoon. We're off to a solid start in 2017, having delivered another quarter of growth on both the top and bottom lines in a challenging environment. While there have been some puts and takes so far, our business is playing out largely as we expected. On the top line, we delivered organic growth of 0.6%, slightly ahead of our expectation, but there's still work to do. Our Power Brands continued to be a strong driver of overall performance, with organic growth up 2.5%, once again outpacing category growth. A number of our key markets, including Russia, Germany, Southeast Asia, and Mexico delivered strong growth. In addition, India rebounded faster than expected from the impact of demonetization, delivering high single digit growth. In fact, except for North America, all regions delivered solid results. I'll say a few more words about North America in just a few minutes. On the bottom line, we continue to make significant progress and build on our strong track record of margin expansion. Adjusted OI margin increased by 90 basis points to 16.8%. Overhead savings and productivity drove the improvement, as we continue to deliver operational efficiencies across the business. Adjusted EPS growth was solid, an increase of 6% at constant currency, driven mainly by operating earnings. And finally, we returned significant capital to our shareholders in the first quarter, with nearly $800 million in dividends and share repurchases. Consistent with the three pillars of our growth strategy that we shared at CAGNY earlier this year, we continue to invest in our advantage platforms. First, we remain focus on contemporizing our core to ensure that our brands stay relevant to a very dynamic consumer. We're investing in our Power Brands and key markets where we see good returns. For example, in EMEA, Cadbury chocolate grew double digits in India, supported by solid innovations and strong marketing, while our team worked with customers to manage through demonetization. Southeast Asia was up mid-single digits, which included solid performance in several countries across the market, and the launch of belVita in Indonesia. In Europe, Russia was up double digits with strong volume growth behind Alpen Gold chocolate. And Germany was up mid-single digits, driven by strong performance of our chocobakery platform and Milka chocolate, as well as from expanded distribution of Oreo and TUC biscuits. In Latin America, Brazil chocolate continues to recover and drove good revenue growth. In addition, Mexico, which remains a source of strength in the region, delivered solid growth with organic revenue up mid-single digits. At the same time, we're taking actions to manage our non-Power Brands. We expect to close two previously announced divestitures in Q2. Our Australian cheese and grocery business, and part of our French confectionery business, which together represent more than $500 million of revenue. These deals are not only financially attractive but they'll also help us increase our Power Brand mix, improve our growth rate, and expand margins, as we eliminate the resulting stranded costs. Our second growth strategy is to support expansion into new consumer need states, especially well-being, as well as into geographic white spaces, like chocolate in China and the U.S., and biscuits in Japan. In the well-being space, we're pleased with the ongoing strength of belVita biscuits, up mid-single digits globally, as well as with the strong launch of Ritz Crisp & Thins in the U.S. And the continued strength of GOOD THiNS crackers. The accelerating growth of well-being products is one of the biggest shifts facing our industry, and we're addressing this with urgency. As we enter the back half of 2017, we have an unprecedented pipeline of innovation, including new items like V\u00e9a as well as renovation of existing products like Triscuit. In addition, we're actively filling geographic white spaces. In the U.S., our Milka Oreo chocolate bars are off to a strong start as we ramp up to full distribution. In China, Milka chocolate continues to build strong brand awareness and trial. In fact, in Q1, Milka achieved a 2.4% market share and brand awareness reached 40%. In Q2, we'll continue our investment in innovation and white spaces, setting the stage for a strong back half. The third pillar of our growth strategy is to continue expanding our sales and distribution capabilities. We're pleased that our eCommerce business posted another quarter of exceptional growth, with net revenue up nearly 30%. We're partnering with key e-tailers such as Alibaba and Amazon as they expand their services in new markets. We're also working with our brick and mortar retail partners who remain the foundation of our business. In addition, we continue to invest in our routes to market. In emerging markets, we're reaching more traditional trade outlets in second and third-tier cities in China and across rural areas of India. We're also working to evolve our coverage in Brazil, to deepen our presence in existing stores while enhancing our impulse portfolio to improve visibility in the hot zone. In developed markets like the U.S., we're expanding our presence in convenience stores as we roll out on-the-go products like belVita Protein bars and smaller pack sizes of our base brands, which are tailor-made for this channel. Our investments in flexible packaging capabilities with our lines of the future are now enabling much broader price pack architecture across our key categories. For example, our new Ritz lines can now flex to produce from 2 slugs to 18 slugs in one package, and from 10 crackers to 40 crackers per slug, with minimal changeover waste. This capability enables us to play in new channels and new occasions at competitive margins. Net-net, our strategy is working, and we remain on track to deliver our full year outlook with improving top line performance as we move through the second half. We're optimistic about our 2017 innovation pipeline, including V\u00e9a, belVita Protein, and Ritz Crisp & Thins in the U.S., new chocobakery products like Milka brownies, Milka Tender Breaks, and Cadbury Roundies in Europe, and Cadbury Dark Milk chocolate in Australia, which provides high cocoa content without the bitterness. These innovations, together with ongoing white space expansions, such as U.S. and China chocolate, will ramp up in the second half. In addition, we expect to capitalize on the opportunity to flex our direct store delivery muscle in the U.S., to accelerate share gains in the second half. Before I turn it over to Brian, I'd like to provide some context on North America. Suffice it to say, we're not satisfied with our performance in this region. We clearly made great progress on margins, but over the past few quarters, we haven't delivered the type of top line growth we expect. This is especially true in our U.S. biscuit business. While the environment continues to be quite challenging, we're actively working to improve the trajectory of our U.S. business. We have many competitive advantages in North America, our iconic brands, DSD capabilities, now advantaged manufacturing assets, and a robust pipeline of well-being innovation. All of these advantages position us to win over the long-term. But we need to better leverage these assets. As you know, two weeks ago, we announced a leadership change in the region. Tim Cofer is now serving as Interim President of our North America region, in addition to his critical role as Chief Growth Officer. Tim is one of our most experienced and proven commercial leaders and has successfully demonstrated his expertise in growing our businesses in both developed and emerging markets. Although it's early days, Tim and the team are focused on fundamentals, fully leveraging our DSD capability, improving sales and marketing execution, delivering our ambitious 2017 innovation plans, and expanding our channel presence. As these initiatives gain traction, we expect to see material improvement in revenue and share in the back half of the year without losing focus on our margin commitments. Now let me turn it over to Brian to discuss our performance in the quarter in more detail. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Thanks. Thanks, Irene, and good afternoon. As Irene stated, it was a solid start to the year in a challenging environment. We're confident that our full year results will be in line with expectations. Given the market conditions, we delivered solid top line growth, with organic net revenue up 0.6%. Easter timing was less of a headwind than we anticipated as customers ordered and we shipped late in the quarter to stage the holiday. This will have some impact on our Q2 dynamics, which I'll address in our outlook. As we discussed in February, the first quarter did also have a minor effect from the 2016 leap year and the timing of Chinese New Year. But in total, the year-over-year impact of the calendar items ended up being pretty immaterial to the quarter. Emerging markets grew 3.5%, while developed markets declined nearly 1%. Our Europe business performed quite well and is off to a good start to the year, but this was more than offset by declines in North America. Now let's take a closer look at our margin performance. We continue to deliver strong adjusted OI margin expansion, with overhead reductions being the primary driver. Adjusted gross margin decreased 20 basis points as solid net productivity improvements and better pricing were offset by unfavorable mix and higher input costs. Adjusted OI margin was 16.8%, up 90 basis points. This improvement was driven by another quarter of overhead reductions from zero-based budgeting and global shared service initiatives. Similar to Q4, these results include the cost of investments in innovation and white space expansion that are largely in advance of revenue, which will become more meaningful in the back half of the year and into 2018. We expect to make even larger growth-related investments in the second quarter, and that will somewhat temper margin delivery in the quarter. But overall, we're on track with our cost agenda and remain confident in our path to ongoing margin expansion, consistent with the targets we've given you. Now let me provide some insight into our regional performance. One of the real strengths of our model is our broad geographic footprint, which allows us to balance weaker markets against stronger ones. In general, we're seeing positive trends in three of our four regions, and they're performing at or above our expectations. Several of our key markets are showing encouraging signs, so even with a few tough markets, we are, in aggregate, well-positioned for good 2017 performance. Europe delivered another quarter of solid margin expansion, with an increase in adjusted OI margin of 60 basis points. Margins now stand at 19.5%. The Q1 margin improvement was driven by strong net productivity, as well as lower overheads, which offset some incremental A&C investments. Organic net revenue was up 1%, driven by volume. Strong programming in both biscuits and chocolate fueled the growth, despite a continued deflationary environment. We also saw good overall performance in Germany and Russia chocolate, offset by weaker performance in the UK chocolate business as heavy promotional spending in the category continued to pressure short-term results. We believe our Europe performance is differentiated, with good growth and strong margins, and provides a great example of our business strategy in action. In EMEA, our team is managing well in a volatile set of markets. Adjusted OI margin declined 60 basis points to 14.6%, driven primarily by increased A&C support, which offset lower overhead costs and good productivity. Organic revenue increased 1.3%, led by solid growth in India and Southeast Asia. Our China business declined due to the timing of Chinese New Year and softer results in biscuits. However, we delivered good growth in chocolate, as our Milka brand continued to perform well and we continued to gain share in gum. We expect the upcoming relaunch of Oreo this summer to provide positive momentum to the biscuit category for the balance of the year. The Middle East continues to be challenging, but we'll face easier comps as we enter the second half of the year. In Latin America, adjusted OI margin increased over 500 basis points to nearly 16%, primarily driven by improved overhead costs and lower A&C spending, as we've adjusted our spending levels to the realities of the market in Brazil. Organic net revenue increased nearly 4%. Mexico grew mid-single digits, driven by solid growth in gum, candy and meals, while Argentina grew high teens through pricing to offset currency-driven inflation. Brazil remains difficult due to persistent economic weakness. We posted another good quarter in chocolate but continue to experience pressure in biscuits due to price gaps and significant down trading. We expect Brazil will continue to be tough and have factored that into our forecast. Finally, in North America, we again delivered solid margin expansion as adjusted OI margin improved by 50 basis points, primarily driven by ongoing overhead savings. Adjusted OI margin for the quarter was 20.8%. As Irene mentioned, our challenges in North America are top line related. Specifically, the region posted a decline of 1.9%, driven primarily by U.S. biscuits but also impacted by gum. We're taking steps to stabilize the business, putting in place experienced operating leadership and investing more heavily in brands that have momentum. These actions give us confidence in our second half plans. Despite disappointing top line results in aggregate, there were bright spots in North America, including belVita, which gained more than 1 point of share, and the launch of Ritz Crisp & Thins late in the quarter, which helped drive a 0.5 point of share improvement for the brand. Gum decreased due to continued category and consumption declines in the U.S., while candy was flat, driven primarily by the timing of Easter. We continue to see good share momentum and profit contribution from candy brands like Sour Patch Kids, which has become a consistent star. Now let me spend a few minutes providing some highlights by category. Snacking category growth declined about 2.5%, a number that was significantly impacted by the year-over-year calendar impact from Easter. We remain comfortable with our full year view of category growth. In this environment, we're pleased that our shares improved, with solid results in all categories. Our biscuits business posted a slight revenue decline as strong growth in countries like the UK, Japan and Italy was offset by weakness in the U.S. Approximately 80% of our revenue grew or held share. In chocolate, our business grew more than 5%, driven by solid results in Germany, India, and Brazil. In addition, we continue to see good momentum with our recent launches of chocolate in the U.S. and China. Approximately 65% of our revenue grew or held share in this category. Gum and candy declined over 5% as the gum category continues to experience significant weakness, especially in the U.S. We're planning for continued declines in the gum category as we focus on growing our share and improving in-store execution. As you know, this is a highly profitable but relatively small business for us. We'll also continue to shift our focus to our strong, growing and highly profitable candy platforms. About half of our revenue in gum and candy gained or held share. Turning to earnings per share, in Q1, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.53, which was up 6% on a constant currency basis. This growth was driven by our strong operating income results. We continue to expect to deliver double-digit EPS growth for the full year. As Irene mentioned during the quarter, we returned approximately $800 million of capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. We continue to expect share repurchases of approximately $1.5 billion for the full year. Now to the outlook. Overall, we're reaffirming our outlook. The first half is generally playing out as we expected, although we do see slightly different dynamics between the quarters. We delivered better growth in margins in Q1 than our forecast, as the first quarter was less impacted by the Easter shift than anticipated. In Q2, the year-over-year compare will be more difficult and we expect North America to remain challenged. Due to these factors, we expect Q2 revenue growth below Q1, with improving growth in the second half. In terms of margin, the second quarter will be affected by higher growth investments and the timing of some spending that shifted from Q1 to Q2. For the total year, we continue to expect to deliver on our outlook. We continue to expect organic net revenue growth of at least 1%. We expect adjusted OI margin in the mid 16% range, as well as double-digit adjusted EPS growth on a constant currency basis. And with respect to free cash flow, we continue to expect to deliver approximately $2 billion for the year, as we see lower CapEx, improved margins, and good working capital efficiency. With that, let me turn it back to Irene for a few closing comments before we take your questions. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.: Thanks, Brian. So, to wrap up, we're off to a solid start and expect to build momentum in the back half of the year, as we benefit from white spaces, launch exciting on-trend innovations, and leverage our U.S. DSD network. We remain confident in our ability to deliver our significant margin commitments this year, and are on track to reach our adjusted OI margin target of 17% to 18% in 2018. We'll continue to make disciplined investments to drive balanced growth on both the top and bottom lines. And we remain committed to compelling capital returns to our shareholders through both dividends and share repurchases. With that, let's open up the line for your questions. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Ken Goldman from JPMorgan. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Thank you. I was pleasantly surprised by your organic sales growth this quarter. I mean, we've seen some data and you guys referred to it regarding your categories on a global basis, so you've talked about some of the holidays, some of the calendar shifts that affected you. I'm just curious, were there any other maybe non-recurring timing issues that either maybe helped or hurt this period, because you've had so many new products in the market, I'm just wondering were your shipments and your consumption more or less aligned this quarter, or were they a little bit out of order. I'm just trying to get a better sense of that. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yeah, Ken, I'd say they're generally aligned. The biggest impact, of course, is the Easter timing, and so there's a lot of noise because of that shift. We shipped \u2013 as Brian mentioned, we shipped much of our Easter volume in Q1, but we'll get the consumption coming when the holiday happened in Q2. If you were to adjust for Easter and non-measured channels, which is a smaller impact, like-for-like category growth would actually be about 1% and our snacks revenue was up about 0.8%, so there's actually pretty close correspondence there. As we said, from a pacing standpoint, the first half is going to come in essentially where we expected it. We're going to see some shift from first quarter to \u2013 from second quarter into first quarter, so first quarter a little higher, second quarter a little lower. The first half will come in essentially where we thought. The second half will be a little bit higher driven by some of the phenomena that I mentioned, the white spaces, the strong innovation pipeline, and our investment in flexing our DSD muscle. So net-net, there's no change to our full year forecast, but there's really no impact in this first quarter. The biggest impact is the Easter timing. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That's helpful. And then quick follow-up from me. I thought you said that the comparison in the organic sales growth number, and forgive me if I heard this wrong, was a little more difficult in the second quarter than the first. Maybe you were talking about total revenue growth? Because I see the comparisons a little bit easier, actually, in the second quarter. Or are you talking earnings maybe? Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yeah, it's more of a top line comment, Ken, and it's specifically North America's year-over-year compares are challenging. It doesn't quite look that way because even in 2015, there were some unusuals that made 2015 good too. So, as we look like-for-like versus 2016, it's a little bit of a tougher compare and North America will be a drag for us in the second quarter. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. Thanks so much, guys. Operator : And our next question comes from Andrew Lazar from Barclays. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi, everybody. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Hey, Andrew. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.: Hey, Andrew. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Just two questions from me, I guess. One would be, with North America results more challenging, you've said you're expecting, obviously, some benefit in the second half from a shift in the sort of competitor, sort of distribution model. It might be early, but I guess, have you seen anything yet that gives you more confidence in that thinking, whether it be information coming from your sales people on the street or your key retail partners, things of that nature? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.: It's a little early, Andrew. I'd say they're spending pretty heavily on their way out right this minute. So I would say right now is probably not a great example. And thankfully the big impact will be in the back half of the year when they've exited. So it's a little too early to tell, but we are certainly doing everything we can to make sure that our guys are staged with support that they need and the focus that they need to get to drive our share. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: And given the timing, Andrew, it could be one of the issues we face in Q2 as they exit. More aggressive behavior in Q2 that we might see play out. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Okay, thanks for that clarity. And then Brian, I know this was the toughest year ago, certainly, gross margin comp that you're going to see all year. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yeah. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: And, obviously, you still had negative volumes in the quarter so that didn't help. I guess, I'm trying to get a better sense of maybe what type of gross margin expansion we're seeing on a like an underlying basis? I'm trying to judge where it goes from here as the comps on gross margins start to ease and volume as you go through the year presumably gets somewhat better. I didn't know if we're still likely to see, I guess, a lower year-over-year gross margin in 2Q, and then it starts to expand in the back half or could we start to see the gross margin trend improve year-over-year really in this quarter? Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yeah, look, I don't want to get into that calling individual quarters on something like gross margin. I think the underlying dynamics for what we're driving here feel pretty good. Net productivity execution continues to be very good. We delivered what we expected in the quarter. We are making some investments in, as you would expect, some product renovations and some of the quality initiatives we have that are affecting productivity, but it was still very good even on a net productivity as reported. We had higher pricing, as you would see in the P&L, but most of that's driven by places like Argentina, Nigeria, Egypt, some of those highly inflationary markets. There are some places in Europe, where we've made some pricing investments as you look at the annual retailer negotiations and how they've played out, and I think those were good decisions based on the trend we see in Europe right now. So, I mean, there's some moving pieces as well with mix, so if you think about markets like the U.S. and the UK and the global gum business, I'd put China in there as well, those tend to be higher-margin markets, and those have been some of the markets that have struggled a little bit in terms of top line. So those are the moving pieces. I think the trajectory over a longer period of time, we continue to see gross margins expand as we move over the next year, but it's hard to call some of those individual dynamics. We'll continue to execute on the productivity, I know that. We've got pricing that's still moving through in those highly inflationary markets. But again, we're focused on the OI margin commitment and the 90 basis points feels pretty good. So, we're kind of controlling what we can control in a pretty volatile market. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Thank you. Operator : And our next question is from Chris Growe from Stifel. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good evening. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Hey, Chris. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Just two questions from me as well. A bit of a follow-on to Andrew's question in relation to gross margin. I've heard you talk about price pack architectures and the capabilities that you have there. I'm just curious, the degree to which mix, and I guess, I put that into mix, should benefit the sales and gross margin, if you will, for the year? Is that something you could discuss in some broader detail? Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Well, it's clearly a focus for us, and as you think about the investments we've made with lines of the future, that was one of the key elements, key assets that we put in place was much more flexibility there. I think it's \u2013 that element of mix is clearly one that's been moving in the right direction as we've done quite a bit of work there. I think it will accelerate, but, again, it's within this context of other moving pieces within gross margin. We do think it's a real asset. It's a real incremental capability that we haven't necessarily had, and allows us to manage through moving up margins where we can but not having to price on its face with customers. So I think it's a real asset, and not really going to call out what the impact in gross margins is. I think it'll be increasing as we get those capabilities up and running everywhere. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Just one other question, if I could ask, in relation to overhead, which was down, and a contributor, if you will, to lower SG&A. Could you cite (33:12), where your overhead is or what sort of progress you're making on that front and how sustainable that is? Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: I think it's \u2013 you've seen us continue to make progress really quarter after quarter here. It is still a focus and a big area of priority. We've shown you some of the progress we've made within some of the ZZB activities, and I think for the most part, the majority of those cost packages are either in top quartile or second quartile performance, and we feel pretty good about that. Shared services, we're, I would say, a little bit more than 75% of the way through the implementations that we have in front of us, and there'll be some additional benefits that play out during 2017. But we feel very good about where overheads are. And, again, it's a little bit of a mixed bag, because we are making some investments in route-to-market and some other parts of business, so that's one we have, probably, the highest confidence in the whole P&L. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Can you say what level your overhead is today, percentage of sales? Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: No, It is within (34:19) SG&A, we've kind of shared with you where A&C spending is and A&C spending has continued to be about the same. I mean, it's up a bit year-over-year in the first quarter, but you can kind of back into where overheads have gone? Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Sure. Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. Operator : And our next question comes from Bryan Spillane from Bank of America. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Hey, Bryan. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Two quick ones for me. Brian, and maybe I might have missed this, but did you give a CapEx forecast for this year? Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: We did. In CAGNY, we shared a framework that said about 4.5% of net revenue this year, and we showed that the trend will actually move down below \u2013 under or about 4% as we get to 2018. So we're on that trend down as we've kind of worked our way through some of the bigger investments related to lines of the future. So, 4.5% for this year is the current call on that one. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. And then, I guess, a follow-up on North America, one of the things that we've seen is there's been so much growth in small format and sort of maybe non-measured channels as well, and so for your biscuit business, has that had an effect on the growth and that you need more sort of resources in some of these emerging channels and you're right now maybe a little bit too resourced on large format, the channels that aren't growing as fast? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.: No, we certainly anticipated this shift over \u2013 we've watched this shift over the last couple of years, Bryan, so we actually have someone in our North American organization who is in charge of channels and his focus for us is on the growth opportunities, particularly in our case, it's primarily about club and C stores. And then \u2013 and we have a separate organization, actually, that is driving eCommerce. So we are resourced to address it. Frankly, the hold up for us was the packaging capability to address these channels. And that's why I'm so pleased with the progress that we've made as we've got these lines of the future up and running because that's the flexibility that we need to be able to go from big pack sizes to small pack sizes. But a critical piece of our growth plan is our ability to be able to improve our share in some of the less traditional channels that have been historically our bread and butter. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And our next question is from Matthew Grainger from Morgan Stanley. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Hi. Thanks, everyone. So, I wanted to come back to North America again first and ask about some of the evidence of renewed private label growth in selected categories. This seems to be a particular issue in the cookie business right now. Just curious for your take on to what extent that's being driven by some shift at the consumer level or whether it's something that's more explicit retailer led initiative? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yeah, we're not seeing that as a macro issue. There's no question. We've actually found that the penetration of private label, even in our biscuit segments, has not changed dramatically over the last little while. So that hasn't been a factor. We think the bigger issue, without a doubt, has been the shift toward well-being, and that's been a key piece of our focus on renovating our base brands like Triscuit or introducing products like GOOD THiNS as well as launch \u2013 the launch of a product like V\u00e9a, which is a new whole-grain product that we will be introducing in July. So that's been more of a factor for us. And I think a lot of the steps that we're taking, particularly with the innovation pipeline I described, are designed to address that opportunity. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks, Irene. And Brian, you talked last quarter about the need to do a better job on trade optimization. I'm just curious whether, in the current environment, this is something you're comfortable trying to address more actively or given the negative price mix we're seeing in developed markets, are you going to continue to tread more cautiously here and be a little bit more tactical? Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yeah, look, I think we're executing the program. We talked a bit about our investment in some resources and data, and we are finding opportunities where we're improving returns on promotional spending. And I think that's been on track. Now, the reality is, we've had to spend some of that back, and we've seen the benefits. We can find that in the P&L, but then we're also seeing areas where it's important that we spend some additional trade back. And that's sort of the dynamic that we've got playing out. So we're continuing to try and educate customers with the data analytics that suggest that heavy promotional spending just doesn't really work to grow categories. And I think that's a real market by market sort of dynamic, but again, we're executing the net revenue management activities pretty well. We're finding benefits and opportunities there. But we're consciously spending some of that back. And as a result, it's not as big a benefit showing up in the P&L. Matthew C. Grainger - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thanks again. Operator : And our next question is from Rob Dickerson from Deutsche Bank. Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. So just kind of a general question on EPS cadence for the year, I know you said you put up, what, 6% adjusted EPS growth in Q1 and you said for Q2 there's, I guess, a bit of a sales come off a bit on a trend basis relative to what we saw in Q1 and maybe there's a little higher investment to the margins not maybe as much on a year-over-year basis. So I'm just curious, I guess, one, if sales, EPS adjusted sales growth was 6% in Q1 and we're double-digit for Q2, should we see, should we expect maybe EPS growth to be a bit lower in Q2 relative to what we saw in Q1 with really the upside for the year coming in the back half? Is that fair? Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yeah, I mean, I'm not going to get into individual quarters. I would just say I think with the 6% in Q1, I mean, we feel good about as you look at the compares through the rest of the year, we would expect to see some improvement as we move through the year, obviously the better back half with revenue picking up and the innovations that'll drive that and the things that we have confidence in will contribute to that. And we'll continue to execute on costs. So you would expect to see EPS continue to improve as you move through the year. That should be the general framework. And then you have to look at the compares from prior year. Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then just in emerging markets, it looks like you still put up the, I guess, 3.5% organic sales growth in Q1. On a tiered stack basis, it does look like \u2013 I mean, it's still impressive, but it does look like there was a bit of a deceleration. Is that mainly Brazil, because it didn't sound \u2013 I know you called out India and Russia and a number of markets that actually did well. What would be the main driver of a bit of a deceleration in emerging markets? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yeah, I would say both Brazil and year-over-year China would have been the other one, but we are very pleased with the performance of our emerging markets and we continue to believe that as the macros in those markets recover, we will see our category recover in a corresponding fashion. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: And China was really a \u2013 Chinese New Year timing is a fair driver there. If you look at Q4, organic growth from emerging, it was 1.5% and it moved to 3.5%. I mean, the biggest driver there is demonetization in India which was much, much smaller impact this quarter. Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. I'll pass it on. Operator : And our next question comes from Alexia Howard from Bernstein. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good evening, everyone. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Hey, Alexia. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi. So, two questions. The first one, with the divestments or the JVs that you're pulling together, but $500 million of revenue is going, are you able to quantify the stranded costs? I know you haven't changed guidance for the year and how quickly you expect to get rid of those stranded costs. And then my second question is around commodity costs. I was quite surprised to see your commodity costs up this quarter, especially with the major decline in cocoa prices that we've seen coming out of Europe and the U.S., frankly. Do you expect that to get easier going forward and how do you expect the gross margin to develop? Thank you and I'll pass it on. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: You got it, Alexia. So stranded costs, I mean, there's obviously \u2013 there's two pieces to each of these, which is what are the stranded costs locally that are controllable by the business that are actionable; and then there's the unallocated sort of corporate. And you'll see us, over the course of the second half of the year, really aggressively deal with the local costs that surround these businesses. I'm not going to provide a quantification of the stranded costs or dilution impact of these two transactions. We'll give you clarity on that at the end of the second quarter as we close them. One of them has already closed, and the other will close towards the end of the quarter. So we'll give you more clarity, I think, when we get there. But we have good line of sight to make those stranded costs go away. Just, as you know, it takes a little bit of time and some of that will likely be into the first part of next year. On commodities, I would just say a couple of things. One, as you think about cocoa, yes, I mean, clearly there has been a fairly significant move in cocoa prices. You have to recognize, I think, that the hedge window for cocoa is longer than, I think, you would expect, and that's really driven by, really our pricing, our ability and the frequency at which we can go after pricing in some of the key markets there. And in some cases, you have annual renegotiations and you want to create certainty in terms of margins in those relationships, so you're going to go out and hedge a little bit further. So, we are hedged longer than, I think, you would expect and therefore don't necessarily have access to the current pricing in this market at this time. The other thing I would note is that dairy for us is almost as big a buy. And, as you look at what's going on today with dairy, dairy prices are up. We have much less ability, there's much less liquidity in that market to do hedging, so we are absorbing some of the pain associated with dairy. And again, it's not nearly as hedged. So those are the dynamics that are playing out. In the short-term, we are seeing some input cost pressure. It's not huge. It's relatively small when you put all of those things together. And then cocoa, again, it'll be a little bit outside the window of the next few quarters that we start getting some of the benefit of lower cocoa prices. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on. Operator : And our next question comes from David Driscoll from Citi. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you so much. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Hi, David. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: I had one question but kind of two pieces on North America. And apologies, you guys have talked about the North American issue so much but I got to be honest with you, I'm still not quite clear on really what's wrong. I know you said that sales are not growing at what you expect it to grow, but Irene, frankly, I think you've done a wonderful job with some of these healthier biscuit brands and so forth and maybe better, much better than most of the other players in the category. So that doesn't feel like anything that's wrong. It feels like a positive. So I don't \u2013 I know you said it's not growing the way you want it grow, but I don't really know what's wrong with it, like why isn't it growing this way? And we do note in our data that we see some pretty heavy promotional activity from Mondel\u0113z, but maybe it's not getting the lift that you want it to get, but maybe you could spend a moment to talk about kind of the heart and soul of what's wrong in the business as you see it? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yeah, first of all, I'm very, very pleased with many of the things that the North American team has done and these are tough times. So as we said, there are many things going the right way. But we have a very unique set of advantages in that market. It starts with our DSD selling organization, but we have incredible iconic brands and we have very significant marketing support. And with all of that, I would expect us to be able to outgrow the category. So part of the challenge in North America has been that the category has been under some pressure. We own that category, and we need to figure out how to drive that category more aggressively. So I would say that's the biggest issue in North America is our biscuit business. I do think that the work that Tim Cofer and the North American leadership team are focused on in the near-term is exactly the right work, which is just blocking and tackling in terms of sales and marketing execution, making sure that we can capture the DSD opportunity, and making sure that we land that pipeline and then as well as the channel, extending the channel presence that we talked about. So they're focused on the right things. We just \u2013 I'd like to see them happen faster because we have been \u2013 had been outgrowing the category for quite some time and it's been a while since that's been the case. And so that's what I'm looking to happen and I think we've got the assets to enable that. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And if I could just do one follow-up on this. You mentioned the DSD muscle like many times on the call. When you say this phrase, can you talk a little bit about how it will manifest itself in store? Is it you would expect larger shelf space for your brands or is it more about the display activity that takes place within the store due to the DSD team? Thank you. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.: It's both of those things, David. I mean, it starts with the fact that there will be some shelf space that will be vacated. One of the benefits of a DSD organization is that there's a broader assortment of inventory that is typically carried and the opportunity now for us to get in some of our secondary brands, many of which actually have better velocity than some of the brands that were on the shelf is priority one, but there's also, because of the expandable consumption of biscuits, the opportunity for us to get more product out on the floor is the other big opportunity. So, it's actually the focus will be on both of those things. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks so much. Operator : And our next question comes from David Palmer from RBC Capital. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Good evening. Last quarter you called out discounting both retailer-led, competitor-led, I think, especially in the U.S. and in the UK. Could you describe how that environment is changing, perhaps, both in the competitive and retailer/customer level versus last quarter? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.: We continue to see aggressive discounting in a number of places and those are the two biggest. The good news is we are seeing \u2013 in the UK, in particular, we are starting to see our shares recover. And as I've said a number of times, the biggest opportunity is to redeploy some of that investment to more category building spending. And what we're finding is in cases where there's heavy promotional spending, it just simply does not grow the category. So, we are still seeing here in the U.S. some aggressive promotional spending, and still seeing it to some extent in the UK, but I am hopeful that as we continue to come with strong innovation and a strong selling story that we can get the focus back on brand equity as well as putting products on the shelf that have strong velocities. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : I mean, just a follow-up to that, there was a feeling that post-Brexit in the UK, the retailers have taken another \u2013 more aggressive stance and that warfare was supposedly tapering off. Has that not ended as quickly as you would have hoped? And in the U.S., obviously, you're hearing a lot of talk about retailers taking a tougher stance against brands. Is that part of the changed environment that you've seen carry over into this quarter? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.: Well, Brexit is not over yet, so I would say everyone is still waiting to figure out what the actual rules will be and there's no question it will put some pressure on both the manufacturers and the retailers and, I think, that's a piece of the uncertainty there. Here in the U.S., I think it is \u2013 it continues to be a challenging promotional environment, but I think we've been able to weather the storm reasonably well. I mean, as I mentioned, our share \u2013 our biscuit share has been flat, the challenges is that that's not good enough. We think we can do much better than that. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Which is better than it was. So... Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yeah. It's improved but it's just not where we'd like to see it. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Operator : And we do have time for one more question. Our question comes from Steven Strycula from UBS. Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. First question for Irene and then I have a follow-up for Brian. Irene when you first guided organic sales for the year on February 7, you commented at least 1% organic sales. And that was a few days before your key competitor communicated a DSD transition. So, I guess, my question is since then, we've heard front-of-store initiatives from CVS and obviously the DSD transition from a competitor, are both of these dynamics baked into your current organic sales guidance for the year? And specifically, are you guys thinking about budgeting share gains in the back half of the year? I'm just trying to assess what kind of upside that we see relative to before or is there any kind of conservatism baked into the full year analysis? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.: Well, I would still say we feel very comfortable with the guidance that we've given. And the reality is there are many moving pieces as we've shared with you today. So, we should pick up share in the back half, as I've said, here in the U.S., but there are some offsets to that and so we've got \u2013 there'll be some puts and takes. We still feel very comfortable with our top line guidance of at least 1%, and importantly, our bottom line margin guidance. And in this environment, we think that's the most prudent planning step. Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : Okay, and then, Brian, for full year gross margins, is there a scenario where we should expect this to be up slightly positive for the year? And Irene, on eCommerce, you guys are growing 30% quite nicely. Where are the puts and takes of that channel growing longer-term? I mean, in terms of clearly getting access to new customer, but from a margin mix perspective, is there anything that maybe is an offset to the opportunity on the revenue front, whether it's unfavorable margin mix for reason X, Y, Z? Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yeah, on gross margins, Steve, I wouldn't get into providing an outlook for gross margins for the year. I think we feel good with the long-term trajectory. We think gross margins are going to get better. We've articulated that. I think there'll be puts and takes and moving pieces, quarter to quarter, but, again, the trajectory, I think, we'll continue to see improving gross margins as we move towards our 17% to 18% commitment. And then on eCommerce, just margins in general, at a (55:17) gross margin line are slightly below as you think about eCommerce as a channel. But when you think about it in total in terms of cash margins that we deliver, we don't necessarily have the same distribution costs associated with serving that channel. So in total we can get to similar margins. And that's basically what we're seeing in the current eCommerce business. Do you want to \u2013 ? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.: We also think we can address underserved occasions like gifting, for example, with many of our biscuit and chocolate items that, for example, in the eCommerce channel that actually don't necessarily, will not necessarily even appear in retail. So our commitment, as we talk about the $1 billion business that we are targeting by 2020, our expectation is that that will have margins that are as good, if not better, than our regular \u2013 than the rest of our portfolio. Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Good quarter. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondelez International, Inc.: Thank you. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our allotted time for today. We ask that you may disconnect your lines, and thank you for participating.",

Shep Dunlap - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Good morning and thanks for joining us. With me today are Irene Rosenfeld, our Chairman and CEO; and Brian Gladden, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out two press releases and presentation slides, which are available on our website, mondelezinternational.com/investors. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we will be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures unless otherwise noted. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Irene. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Thanks, Shep, and good morning. By now, I'm sure you've seen our two press releases, and you're all Googling furiously. So before we discuss our second quarter results, let me take a few minutes to talk about my decision to retire and our plans for CEO succession. In 2006, when I became CEO of Kraft Foods, it was about to become an independent publicly-traded company. We were a U.S.-centric conglomerate with a vast portfolio of undersupported brands in a wide variety of categories. Over the last decade, we took a number of bold actions to create today's Mondel\u0113z International, most notably the acquisition of Cadbury; the spin-off of our North American grocery business, which created the new Kraft; and the creation of the world's largest pure-play coffee company. As a result, we're now the leading snacking company in the world with 85% of our net revenue coming from snacks, market-leading positions in each of our categories and more than 70% of our revenue coming from profitable Power Brands, a presence in over 165 countries and nearly 40% of our sales in faster-growing emerging markets. Importantly, over that time, we enabled the creation of tremendous value for our shareholders, including over $120 billion through share price appreciation and dividends, and total shareholder returns that have significantly outperformed our peers. It has been the honor of a lifetime to serve as Chairman and CEO of this great company. I truly enjoyed working alongside my colleagues around the world to achieve our bold ambitions and create value for our shareholders. As I announce my retirement today, let me emphasize that I've never been more confident in our plans and in our momentum as I prepare to turn the reins over to my successor, Dirk Van de Put, currently President and CEO of McCain Foods. Over the past few years, our board has been engaged in a thorough multiyear succession planning process. This included a comprehensive global process that considered numerous highly talented internal and external candidates. I'm very pleased with the process that resulted in the choice of Dirk. We're confident that we found the right leader to steer our company to the next stage of our journey to sustainable growth. Dirk is a truly global executive, a seasoned CEO, who's had deep experience in the food and beverage industry at leading CPG companies with presence in emerging and developed markets. He's lived and worked on three continents and has proven his ability to drive growth on both the top and bottom lines. Under Dirk's leadership since 2011, McCain Foods has grown net sales by more than 50%, three quarters of which was organic, and EBITDA has grown double-digits for each of the past six years. Importantly, he achieved these strong results with a values-based leadership style and a steadfast focus on people. We look forward to his bringing this experience and a fresh set of eyes to build on our margin progress and accelerate our growth. I have no doubt that Dirk together with our strong leadership team will continue to achieve even greater success in the years ahead. And of course, I'll be cheering loudly from the sidelines as a sizable shareholder. Dirk will become CEO effective in November, and I look forward to continuing to serve as Chairman of our board until the end of the first quarter next year to ensure a smooth transition. With that context, let me thank all of you for your support and commitment to our company over these many years. Brian and I look forward to introducing you to Dirk as he comes on board. So now, let's talk about our second quarter. It's difficult to discuss our Q2 results without first saying a few words about the malware incident of June 27. Despite tremendous efforts by our teams to continue to operate the business, manufacture our products and serve customer needs, given the timing of the attack, we experienced meaningful disruption in our ability to ship and invoice during the last four days of the quarter. As a result, our Q2 organic net revenue growth was negatively affected by approximately 2.4 percentage points, slightly less than what we estimated in our July 6 press release. While we're not yet back to normal, we expect to recover the majority of these delayed shipments in the third quarter. Brian will discuss this in more detail in a few minutes. Despite this unfortunate incident, our underlying performance in Q2 was largely in line with our expectations. Excluding the impact of the malware incident and the India Goods and Services Tax, organic net revenue would have been roughly flat, and three of our four regions performed well. On the bottom line, despite the impact of the malware incident, we continued to deliver strong adjusted operating income margin expansion and double-digit adjusted EPS growth at constant currency. What's more, we feel especially good about our strong and growing cash flow, which enables us to fully fund our growth initiatives and deliver compelling capital returns. In the second quarter, we returned approximately $900 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. In addition, we announced today that our board has increased the quarterly dividend by 16%, reflecting the strength of our business and our improving free cash flow. Going forward, we're now planning to grow our dividend in excess of adjusted EPS growth. While Brian will provide details on our performance by region, I'd like to say a few words about North America, which continued to be challenged. As we discussed last quarter, we're actively working to improve the trajectory of our U.S. business, and the team is executing with a sense of urgency. While the Q2 numbers were soft, we are seeing some green shoots which give us confidence that we'll see improvement in the back half. In particular, we're optimistic about our robust pipeline of well-being innovation and core brand renovation, our white space chocolate expansion and gains in displays and shelf space as we capitalize on our competitor's transition out of its DSD network. So in summary, our underlying performance in the first half came in largely as expected, and we continue to expect improved top line growth as we progress through the second half. As a result, we've maintained our full year outlook. Let me now turn it over to Brian to discuss our Q2 performance in more detail. Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Thanks, Irene, and good morning. Before I get into the quarter, let me provide more details on the malware incident and where we currently stand in our recovery. On June 27, like many other companies, we were globally impacted by an unprecedented malware incident. For the last four days of the quarter and into the third quarter, we had limited ability to ship and invoice customers in many markets. Thankfully, our teams managed to keep many of our manufacturing facilities running, which was a critical accomplishment. We executed our business continuity and contingency plans to contain the impact of the incident and minimize business disruption with a focus on consumers and customers. Over the past four weeks, we've worked tirelessly to restore our systems and recover from the disruption. Although we've now restored the majority of our affected systems, in a few cases, parts of our supply chain have still not fully recovered, and we anticipate some impacts in our third quarter. We'll also incur some additional one-time costs related to the incident during the second half. In terms of our results, the malware incident had a negative impact of approximately 240 basis points to organic net revenue, or about $140 million. We expect to recover a majority of the delayed second quarter shipments in our third quarter, and we've made good progress in shipping these orders during the month of July. We did, however, permanently lose some revenue due to shorter supply chains, mispromotions and lost consumption in some markets. That said, we do not believe the incident has had any long-term impact to our customer relationships or market share. We're pleased with our execution during this crisis and believe that our business continuity plans were effective in minimizing the impact to our customers and to our ongoing financial results. As you can imagine, we are conducting a comprehensive review of the incident to determine any potential opportunities to further improve the security of our global systems environment. Currently, we do not expect the required investments to be material to our results. This event has underscored the resiliency of our team and their ability to pull together in the face of adversity. I'd like to thank our teams for their tireless efforts to put us back on track and ensure that we're focused most importantly on our customers and consumers. As Irene stated, our second quarter results were largely in line with our expectations, absent the malware incident and the transition impact of the India GST, which were a combined headwind of 260 basis points to our top line growth. Excluding these items, our organic net revenue growth would have been essentially flat. The impact of these incidents masked solid results in a number of areas. For instance, our global e-commerce net revenues continued to grow strongly, up 30%. In Europe, we executed well overall and especially in our chocolate business. And several of our emerging markets are stabilizing and have an improving macro outlook. We're delivering solid results in countries such as India, Vietnam and Mexico, where market fundamentals are improving, and our momentum is strong. Now let's take a closer look at our margin performance. Q2 marked another quarter of strong adjusted OI margin expansion as we continued to aggressively reduce cost. Adjusted OI margin was 15.8%, up 90 basis points. Our progress was driven by improved SG&A as we continued to execute our Zero-Based Budgeting program, which delivered cost reductions in both overheads and advertising spend. We expect our advertising and consumer promotion spending will be about flat for the total year as we move some spending to the second half. Adjusted gross margin decreased 10 basis points as continued solid net productivity and better pricing were offset by unfavorable mix and higher input costs, especially in dairy. We continue to see gross margin improvements as a key enabler to delivering our 2018 margin expansion commitments. For the first half, adjusted OI margin was 16.3%, and we remain on track to deliver our mid-16% outlook for the year. I do want to note that we decided to adjust out the incremental costs associated with the malware incident in the quarter, representing about $7 million. As I said, we will incur additional one-time costs in the second half as well but do not expect them to be material at this point. Let me now turn to our regional performance. We continue to see solid trends underlying the results in three of our four regions. Europe posted another strong quarter of margin expansion with an increase in adjusted OI margin of 220 basis points to 19%. Strong net productivity, lower A&C costs and continued overhead reductions drove the improvement. Organic net revenue declined 0.7%, including a negative impact of 220 basis points due to the malware incident. Despite this impact, Europe delivered solid vol/mix growth in both chocolate and biscuits, and our chocolate business performance was led by Germany and Russia. Our Europe business continues to demonstrate solid operating performance, and we remain encouraged by additional growth opportunities, including in chocolate bakery and chocolate seasonals. In our large and diverse EMEA region, we continue to navigate through a mixed environment. Our Asia Pacific business delivered solid results while some of our markets in the Middle East continue to be challenged. Adjusted OI margin increased 230 basis points to 15.6%, driven primarily by lower A&C spend, continued overhead management and a property insurance recovery. In markets like the Middle East, we've selectively trimmed A&C spending where returns have been challenged. Organic revenue declined 0.7%, including a negative impact of 90 basis points from the transition impact of the India GST and the malware incident. Despite those impacts, we delivered strong results in India and Southeast Asia. Our India business grew mid-single digits despite the impact from GST. Excluding this headwind, growth would have been double-digit. Chocolate continued to be strong as we executed our plans, and the overall market conditions remained good. China posted a small decline, driven primarily by soft category trends. Our gum business continued to grow and take share, and Milka chocolate performed in line with our expectations. We expect our biscuit business trajectory to improve as we relaunched Oreo this summer with both improved packaging and a new product formula. Difficult economic conditions in the Middle East continue to pressure category growth, but our year-over-year comparisons are easier in the second half. In Latin America, adjusted OI margin increased 530 basis points to 14.3%, primarily driven by improved overhead costs and lower A&C spend, as we continue to adjust our spending levels to match the market dynamics in countries like Brazil and Argentina. Organic net revenue declined 0.5%, including a negative impact of 280 basis points from the malware incident. Mexico delivered solid growth, driven by strength in candy while Argentina implemented pricing to offset currency-driven inflation. Brazil remains challenging due to continued economic weakness. Our chocolate business delivered a third consecutive quarter of growth and solid share performance, while our biscuits business continued to face difficult price gaps and consumer down trading. Consistent with our discussion during our first quarter call, our North America results were challenged in Q2 as overall category growth was even lower than our tempered expectations. Adjusted OI margin declined 250 basis points to 19.2%, driven primarily by benefits in the prior year related to an asset sale. It's important to note that of all of our regions, the North America region was most impacted by the malware incident, driven by the lower trade stock levels associated with DSD. As we've said, this is also the market where we had the majority of our lost consumption due to the July 4 holiday timing. Organic net revenue declined 8%, including a negative impact of 410 basis points from the malware incident. These results were driven by U.S. biscuits, as well as declines in gum. As Irene mentioned, we're moving with a sense of urgency to address the issues we've identified and feel confident this business will return to growth. We continue to expect to see improved results in the back half of the year. We have a strong second half innovation agenda in North America. This includes our new V\u00e9a snacks and non-GMO Triscuit crackers, both of which launched in July as well as belVita Protein, RITZ Crisp & Thins and GOOD THiNS, which continue to gain share. Our white space Oreo Milka chocolate candy is also gaining momentum with healthy velocity and stronger peak rates as we expand distribution and capacity. In addition, our DSD-driven share gain plans are now beginning to play out as we'd expected. As our competitor began to transition out of its DSD system at the end of Q2 and our major customers reset their shelves, we're now capitalizing by gaining displays and share of shelf. We expect this to be a key growth driver in the second half and into next year. Now, let me spend a few moments providing some highlights by category. Snacking category growth was 1.5%, which was generally in line with our full year expectation. We're pleased that our shares have stabilized and were roughly flat for the first half. You should note that these revenue growth numbers include the negative impact of the malware incident. Our biscuits business posted a revenue decline as solid performance in the UK, Japan and Germany was offset by weakness in the U.S. Approximately 80% of our year-to-date revenue grew or held share. In chocolate, our business grew 5%, driven by solid results in Germany, India and Brazil. We continue to see good momentum in U.S. chocolate, which is now benefiting from increased capacity coming out in the second half, as well as Milka in China, which continued to perform well. Approximately 60% of our year-to-date revenue grew or held share in this category. Gum and candy declined approximately 7% as the gum category continued to experience significant weakness, especially in the U.S. We're planning for continued category declines while working on initiatives to stabilize share and shift focus to our strong, growing and highly profitable candy and mint platforms. About 45% of our year-to-date revenue in gum and candy gained or held share. Turning to earnings per share, in Q2, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.48, up 19% on a constant currency basis, driven by our strong operating income growth. We continue to expect to deliver double-digit EPS growth for the full year. As you think about your models, let me remind you that our results now exclude the impact of our French confectionery and Australian cheese and grocery business divestitures that closed in April and early July, respectively. These items were detailed in an 8-K we issued last week. These businesses account for approximately $530 million in revenue and $0.06 of EPS on an annual basis. The divestitures improve our growth rates while we're moving quickly to remove stranded costs associated with these actions. In Q2, we returned approximately $900 million of capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. As we receive cash for our two recent divestitures, we're increasing our full year expectation for share repurchases to between $1.5 billion and $2 billion. In addition, we raised our quarterly dividend by 16% and are now targeting to grow our dividend faster than adjusted EPS as our improving free cash flow generation enables us to continue to fully fund our critical growth and transformation investments while also deploying more capital to shareholders. Now to our outlook. Overall, our outlook is unchanged for the full year. Our organic net revenue growth target remains at least 1%. We expect adjusted OI margin in the mid-16% range as well as double-digit adjusted EPS growth on a constant currency basis. As you think about your models for the next two quarters, remember that Q4 is seasonally a higher revenue quarter and will be higher than Q3 even after the impact of the additional malware incident related shipments. You'll note that we're absorbing the dilution from the two divestitures, but we're also adjusting our outlook for interest expense for the year, and the two items roughly offset one another. And with respect to free cash flow, we continue to expect to deliver approximately $2 billion for the year as we see lower CapEx, improved margins and good working capital efficiency. With that, let me turn it back to Irene for a few closing comments before we take your questions. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Thanks, Brian. Throughout my tenure as CEO, the world and our industry have undergone unprecedented change. During that time, we anticipated the emerging challenges, adapted accordingly, and in the process, created significant value for our shareholders. I'm proud to leave this company far stronger than the one I started with. I'm indebted to my 90,000 colleagues around the world who have worked tirelessly to deliver their commitments each and every day in the face of many challenges. Looking ahead, I'm confident that our long-term value-creation strategy continues to position us to win and that the future for our great company is, indeed, very bright. With that, let's open it up for questions. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Good morning, everyone, and congratulations to you, Irene. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Thanks, Bryan. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I guess, my question is just related back to the North American biscuit category. I guess everything you see is that snacking in general is still growing, yet the category is sort of lagging snacking growth in North America. So Irene, can you sort of just give us some more color in terms of where you think the category is missing? Is it not channel diverse enough? Is it losing share to other snack options? Just trying to understand really why the category seems to be lagging overall snacking in North America. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Yeah. Bryan, we talked about this at CAGNY. And frankly, we've been looking at this for quite some time. I think it starts with the fact that we're seeing price deflation and erosion in promotion effectiveness in a number of markets but particularly acute in the U.S. And I think you probably have heard that from many of our competitors. In response to that, we are progressing our revenue management activities to continue to find those places that we're getting the best return, to work with our customers to understand the ROI of some of the various promotional practices that are going on. And frankly, I do believe that U.S. food deflation will begin to stabilize later this year. The second one is that we are seeing continued shifts toward health and well-being products. And again, as we've talked on a number of occasions, we're taking significant steps, both in terms of renovating existing brands with things like organic Triscuits, belVita Protein, RITZ Crisp & Thins as well as totally new products like V\u00e9a, which we just are in the process of introducing into the marketplace. And we believe that will help to not only improve our share position, and it's a big part of our back half share recovery, but we also think it will ultimately stimulate category growth. And then lastly, there is a piece that is non-measured channels. Again, primarily e-commerce, which in snacks is a fairly small piece of the business, but it's also natural food stores and other places where the consumer is shopping and once again, it's one of the reasons we have chosen to focus our efforts so much as we complete our supply chain reinvention on having the flexibility to introduce different package formats and different package sizes so that we can be present in whatever channels the consumer is shopping. So net-net, we are seeing continued category declines. And in fact, as Brian said, it got a little bit worse in the second quarter, but we have great confidence as we look to the back half of the year, particularly a number of the actions that we're taking that will start to see that category recover. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning, everybody. Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Hey, Andrew. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Irene, congratulations as well from me on your decision. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Thank you. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Two quick questions. First just the first one around Dirk, I know he doesn't start till November. Mondel\u0113z, obviously, has a 2018 margin target. You've got an expectation that margins can further improve in the years thereafter. I'm sure any new CEO candidate is going to do their due diligence around the certain targets that are out there, whether they be revenue or margin oriented. But I mean, could we have confidence, I guess, that Dirk is sort of fully bought in, if you will, and supportive of the kind of margin targets that are already out there? Or do you think there's still a need for a new CEO to come in and do his or her own sort of more in-depth analysis in the seat, and that those things are all potentially subject to change? And then I've just got a follow-up. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Well, I think there's no question. It's too early to speculate on what Dirk might do as he gets fully on board. But what I will say is, he's very familiar certainly from having done his own due diligence about what this company's progress has looked like, and what our aspirations are. And quite frankly, as I said, one of the reasons that we selected him as our leader is the fact that he has a very proven track record of being ambidextrous, as I call it, walking and chewing gum, top line and bottom line, and it's actually quite an impressive set of results. So he's a seasoned CEO. He knows well the challenges that one needs to make on the top line and the bottom line. And again, he's got a proven track record in that area. So, I have great confidence that he will come in here. Obviously, he wants to learn and form his own opinions, but I feel quite comfortable with the targets that are laid out. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Thank you for that. And then, just to follow back up on North America biscuit, obviously the competitor DSD transition is one of the things that you pointed out that will help improve biscuit trends in the back half of the year. And you mentioned some incremental display and shelf gains. Now that we're a little further into this process, I was wondering if there were any maybe more specific metrics you could share along those lines. Because I guess when it was initially announced, Mondel\u0113z was certainly pretty excited about the potential opportunity. And maybe it's just me, but it seems like more recently, some of the commentary from the company has been a little more along the lines of, well, we'll see if we get a benefit. If not, we can always rethink things, too. And I'm just trying to think maybe it's more the way I'm reading into it than it is reality. But any color you can share around some of the metrics about the type of gains maybe you'd expect might be helpful there? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Andrew, we feel every bit as confident and optimistic about the opportunity that our competitor's exit presents us with. For competitive reasons, we've been reticent to get into a lot of the specifics, but I will tell you we are seeing early success, and part of the challenge is we've been talking about this for quite some time. They announced six months to nine months ago, and we told you what we were going to do, and now we're actually about doing it. So, we have every confidence that we will pick up incremental shelf space, incremental displays, and it will be a key contributor to the trajectory change on our North American business in the back half of the year. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: And I think, Andrew, as you look at some of the July data, it will be a little messy because of some of the malware shipment timing issues. But again, at the individual retail or account level, we feel very good about the progress. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: I guess the other point is, Andrew, it is an expensive capability, and so we want to be clear with our shareholders that we will be prudent as we continue to leverage this asset to make sure that it's giving us a good return. So that's the context in which you might have heard us refer to that. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel Capital. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, good morning. Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Hey, Chris. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I wish you well, Irene, in your retirement as well. In relation to revenue growth, as I think about the organic revenue growth, the improvement required in the second half of the year, I guess, I wanted to understand where you're seeing some strength in the business? I heard you, Brian, mention some better emerging market performances kind of shaping up there. I'm just trying to understand where you're seeing that improvement that will help us get a better feel for the second half improvement in revenue growth? Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Yeah. Look, you're talking globally? Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Globally, and I realize that the malware incident, you have some benefit in Q3. I get that. I was thinking more about the underlying business, if you will, and how it's improving. Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Yeah, look, there's no question as we think about the second half. So you can do the math on what we need to do in the second half to get to at least one. That's still \u2013 we need a good second half. The malware incident has created a headwind, and I would say it does make that target a little bit tougher as we talked a little bit about some of the third quarter challenges. But I'll give you a few reasons to believe that we feel good about the second half. Three of our four regions are actually executing well and don't really need a significant change in trajectory as we look at the second half. The second thing is we will ship through the majority of the Q2 malware shipments. And again, July, we did the majority of that and feel good about that. We also, as Irene talked a bit about North America, we have good confidence in North America having a much better second half, and it's about the DSD opportunity. It's about the pipeline of health and wellness opportunities that we're pursuing, and it's about the execution of the team as we've had leadership in place there. So, those are really the drivers that I think we feel good about it. There's the V\u00e9a, the Triscuit and the share gains that we'll have, and we think that will also help the category growth in North America. And then in general, I think as you look at the second half, we have easier compares. You got India demonetization. You've got some of the weakness we saw and trade stock dynamics playing out of the Middle East that I think will help us in the second half as we look at compares. So look I think we feel pretty good about the opportunity to have a much better second half, and those are the real drivers. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I just had one quick follow-up question for you. I did hear a number of divisions where A&C spending was down. In some cases, it was you're kind of rightsizing to the opportunity in a given market like in Latin America. Is that the trend then we should expect or as you think about reinvestment back in the business, maybe not so much just all A&C, but how is that A&C trending in the second half of the year? Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Yeah, look. I think we expect \u2013 it was around 9% for the first half, which is slightly down from where we were in the first half of last year, but roughly in the range of where we've been as we look at the last six quarters or so. For the full year, I would say we'll be approximately flat. So, we will have a little bit of timing and more A&C spending in the second half. We continue to distort that spending, obviously, to Power Brands and to markets where we're seeing the growth opportunity, and therefore, we've taken it out of some. Digital mix continues to be a priority. We're projected to be at 30% of our spend on digital. We still think that makes lots of sense. And again, as I said, given the innovation initiatives that we have in the back half, that will drive some of the spending that we have lined up for the second half. Christopher Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you for your time. Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: You got it, Chris. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, and Irene, best wishes to you from me as well. Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Hi, Ken. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Irene, it's a little backward looking of a question, and you highlighted many of your accomplishments over the years, and clearly, you've helped create a lot of value for shareholders. But everyone has decisions we wish we could change. I always find it interesting to sort of ask outgoing leaders. As you look back on your career running Kraft and Mondel\u0113z, are there any choices that stand out that you made that maybe with 20/20 hindsight you would have done slightly differently? I always find that informational. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Yeah. No, I think it's a great question. Actually as I have had a chance to reflect on the last decade or so, I'm quite proud of a number of the things that happened. I think the portfolio decisions probably are kind of at the top of the list. I'm proud of the pivot that we made in response as we launched the company, the pivot that we made to more aggressively go after cost and improve margins. And I think in hindsight, I think perhaps we could have gone after the costs a little faster that would have helped us to be able to have the fuel to invest in our growth a little bit sooner. But I actually think that one of the things that I'm most proud of is having been able to balance the long-term and the short-term and the flexibility to pivot as we did in 2013, 2014 as we jump-started ZBB and supply chain reinvention and our Mondel\u0113z Business Services to allow us to deliver the margin expansion. So, I think my regret is that we haven't fully realized the potential on the top-line, and I have every confidence again as I hand the reins over to Dirk and we look at his track record that, that is the last piece of the puzzle here. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. And then a quick follow-up for me. Can you talk about the board's decision? I know you mentioned what Dirk's qualifications are, and certainly, he's had a good bit of success at McCain, but can you talk about the board's decision to go outside the firm to identify the next CEO? Typically, there are internal candidates at the senior level who are interested in these kind of jobs. So how do you think about that? And frankly, how is the team and the board managing the morale of the top internal candidates who maybe, to be frank, are slightly disappointed right now? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Yeah. Over the last couple of years as I talked with the board about my plans and my timeline for retirement, they put in place, as you would expect, a very thorough multiyear process. And in that process, the board considered both internal and external candidates, and there was a very talented pool of both internal and external candidates. I'm very pleased with the choice of Dirk and for all the reasons that we've laid out, and I feel quite confident that he will work hand in glove with our senior leaders to deliver on the commitments that we've made. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good morning, everyone. Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Hi, Alexia. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Wishing you all the very best for the next chapter, Irene. Thank you. Can I ask about the gross margin outlook? It feels as though the gross margin progression has been pretty flat recently, I guess, certainly this quarter. The commodity outlook, I mean, dairy's obviously a problem at the moment. Will you get some relief at some point perhaps on the cocoa side? And then can you talk specifically about the pricing environment? Particularly here in North America, we're hearing that a lot of the retailers are getting pretty aggressive on pricing, pushing private label. I know that's not a huge issue in confectionery, but it may be in cookies and crackers. So maybe just a few comments on the gross margin outlook, and I'll pass it on. Thank you. Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Sure, Alexia. Yeah, I mean, gross margins were down slightly in the quarter, and that's sort of the trend we've had over the last few quarters. The net productivity, the supply chain reinvention work is executing well. We're delivering strong net productivity. So that's not the challenge. I would say, clearly, we lost some volume leverage in the quarter as it related to the malware issue, and the pricing dynamic, pricing in general was positive, and the reality is most of that was driven by some of the inflationary economies like Argentina and Egypt, Nigeria. Those are big, big drivers where we had significant pricing. There's a couple of places where we have seen trade spending and incremental pricing challenges. You call out the U.S. I would just say in the U.S., that pricing has been more or less tied to some of the DSD opportunities as we position to gain some market share and take shelf space. Obviously, that's part of the equation and just something that we had expected to do. So we've been appropriately investing there. So again, I would just close by saying I think gross margins will continue to be a key element as we look at the margin expansion. And again, we have a full portfolio of programs we're driving around productivity that we expect will deliver over the next multiple quarters here. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: And the commodity outlook, does it get better in 2018? Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Yeah. Clearly, we've seen cocoa drop, but as you know, it's more than cocoa in the portfolio. Dairy has been a challenge. Even cocoa butter has been a challenge, wheat and sugar. There're some other things moving the other way. Right now, in the first half of the year, commodities were a pressure, and they were a pressure versus what we even had in our plans. As we go to the second half, not significant changes, as we're mostly hedged for a lot of those commodities, and dairy, as I think you know, there's not a lot of liquidity, and you can't really hedge that exposure. So as you head into 2018, based on what we see right now, there's a bit of relief. But obviously, you have to work through the pricing dynamics, and it's a complex equation. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. I'll pass it on. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good morning, folks. Congratulations, Irene, for your pending retirement. I hope you have ample time to enjoy it in the years ahead. I guess I want to come back to the top line growth and what you're highlighting for category growth. You're footnoting a lot of brick-and-mortar data with Nielsen, which I think we all know is sort of imperfect. If we marry it with Euromonitor data and try to replicate your analysis, it yields a different conclusion, that your end markets are growing something closer to a bit north of 4%, which is slower than historical context, but a lot better than the bit north of 2% that you reported last year. I mean, there's flaws in both data sets. But as you contemplate what's not captured in Nielsen, do you think Euromonitor may be a more accurate prediction? Or structurally, do you really think your categories are slowing so much so rapidly? And what does it mean for the long term? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: So Jason, I think the growth is closer to 2% than it is to 4%. I'm not quite sure how you've put those numbers together. And it is slower than certainly than the rates that we would have seen a number of years ago. But I think we've set our expectations properly. I think we've got a good sense of category growth. We've been focused disproportionately on our share growth. I'm delighted to see our shares stabilizing as we come out of the second quarter. And we are very focused on our pipeline of innovation and renovation to help to continue to drive our overall share performance. So I think in the foreseeable future, we're probably looking at category trends in the approximately 2% range, and I think we have a real opportunity to drive our share performance within those categories. Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: But we are, as we've talked about, disproportionately moving investments and building route-to-market capability and distribution around channels that are growing faster. So acknowledging that there are some unmeasured channels that clearly may provide more growth is something we've done and clearly, putting some investment there is part of our strategy. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Sure, sure. But it sounds like thinking about the path to eventual reacceleration, it's a path to 2% now, not a path to north of 4%. I mean, tell me if you disagree with that. And then secondly, I'm looking at the same chart you showed in the first quarter. First quarter category growth down 2.5%, this quarter up 1.5% on a year-to-date basis, suggesting that this quarter actually had a pretty dramatic snap back in category growth. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: If you recall, Jason, the issue in the first quarter was the timing of Easter, so... Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Consumption for Easter was \u2013 yeah. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Year-to-date, we're approximately at about 1.5%. So that smooths out the impact of Easter. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: We said (45:59) in the first quarter was somewhere closer to 1%. So it's 1% to 1.5% is about what we're seeing pretty consistently. Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: But, let me bring this back. We continue to feel very strongly with snacking categories, we'll grow faster than the rest of food that we will grow faster than center of the store categories because we are more impulse driven. We've got good demographic trends as a tailwind as we think about the fact that people are traveling farther to work, more women in the workforce, et cetera, which is causing people to snack more often. And so the combination of all of those factors together should give us a nice tailwind, particularly the emerging market is really the key to getting the aggregate category growth closer to the levels that you're talking about is really to see the emerging markets come back, and slowly but surely. We're starting to see that, in markets like Brazil, for example, they're still well below historical rates. So as we see the emerging markets come back, our strong footprint in those markets, our strong brand positions, together with the actions that we're taking should allow us to disproportionately continue to grow our share and the categories in the face of the broader macro trends. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, thanks for the question. And best wishes, Irene. Hey, Brian, I think when we met a couple of months ago, you said that you had a whole war room set up to try to plot a strategy for the second half for Nabisco and DSD, but I was hoping you could give us some numbers on any kind of distribution gains that you've achieved? You mentioned it qualitatively. But is there anything you can help us with when we watch the Nielsen data come through as to what kind of ACV to expect or just roughly how many customers you've made gains with? Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Yeah. I think, Rob, it's still just a little bit early. I hope you can sense our optimism and positive energy around it. I think, clearly, we're in the middle of shelf resets now, and you'll start to see that play out as you move through August and into September. And as I said a little bit earlier, there is a bit of noise because of some of the shift in timing and what played into July, and how that may have affected some of the shelf resets, and we're working through that now. But I'm not going to provide details. I mean, obviously, there's a competitive sensitivity to sharing some of that data as well. You'll see it play out, but I think it'll play out as you get through the third quarter into the fourth quarter, I think it'll be much clearer in some of that reported data. That's what I would say. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: So your confidence then, Brian, is because you have commitments like verbal commitments from customers to make these changes? Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: In many cases, yes. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good morning. Thanks for the question. Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Hey, John. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Irene, you mentioned your belief in gaining market share in a 2% growth category and, I guess, what stands out is maybe your distribution model in China, which enabled gum success, and now we're seeing it again with Milka. How unique is your route-to-market in China and its ability to leverage multiple categories? And how should we think about your other routes-to-market either by category or geography where the structure may be allows you do more in terms of cross-selling, like where are you not fully maximizing your potential at this point? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Well, I think, John, it's actually \u2013 our route-to-market in China is somewhat unique relative to other markets. But frankly, the success that we've had with gum and now in chocolate is simply the playbook, which is that we intend to have all of our categories available in all of our countries. And so as we think about the emerging markets, most of those countries are dominant single category countries. And slowly but surely, we are bringing our brands into those white spaces, and so chocolate in China is a good example. The opportunity to bring chocolate here to the U.S. is another example. It's not about the nature of the route-to-market. Frankly, it's our investment in the feet on the ground that allow us to have the reach into broader parts of the country. So the investments that we're making in all of our geographies are designed to give us the infrastructure in Brazil, in China, in India, and South East Asia that will then allow us to put all of our categories through that pipe. So we have great visibility and optimism about the runway of growth opportunities that will come from the introduction of all of our categories into what is white space for us in a number of markets. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : And just as a follow-up, in terms of where your resources stand today, what's your ability to get to achieve that with organic resources as opposed to anymore externally on M&A? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: As we've said, we feel very good about the overall composition of the portfolio and about our reach. We are well positioned certainly in the BRIC markets and in a number of the second-tier markets, but we will continue to look for opportunities to supplement that portfolio as we did in Vietnam, with our Kinh Do acquisition. So in that case, we had a business in Vietnam. It was fairly small. We instantly became the number one snacking company in that country with the acquisition of Kinh Do. So we will continue to look for opportunities to supplement our basic footprint, but we feel quite good about the overall footprint and approximately 40% of our revenue that is in emerging markets. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : We have time for one final question. Our final question this morning comes from Steven Strycula with UBS. Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Congrats, Irene, and Brian, you never showed me your DSD war room. So next time I come to Chicago, I want to see it. But... Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: (52:18) Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : All right. Two questions. First one is for Irene for chocolate production. With cross-border taxes being less of an issue going forward, how do you think about freeing up extra capacity locally to feed the U.S. marketplace? And can you speak to some of the success you've had already with the Oreo and Milka launch? Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Is that chocolate specifically, Steve, or just broadly? Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. Specific to chocolate. Brian T. Gladden - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Yeah, So one of the things I said in the prepared comments was we have added capacity that that's come online even in the last few weeks, and we now have the capability in the U.S. to accelerate some of our distribution expansion. So you'll see a broader footprint and a bigger market position for Oreo, Milka as that capacities come on. It's not U.S. based capacity. We will likely, as this business grows and we continue to invest, need to have a discussion around where we put incremental capacity beyond that, and that's something that we probably phase into within the next probably 12 months as we think about that business. But we're not there yet, and we've got plenty of capacity to drive the growth that we have for the second half and into next year. Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And then, Irene, for emerging markets, I've heard other CPG companies with more global footprints talk about losing share to local brands in markets like Brazil, similar to what's happening in biscuits right now. What is key to kind of reaccelerating volume and taking back market share in places like Brazil or even Russia? Is it really coming out with more affordable price pack architecture? Or just maybe even launching new brands that are more geared to the lower income demographic? Could you kind of speak to how we kind of accelerate in those markets? Irene B. Rosenfeld - Mondel\u0113z International, Inc.: Yeah, and it's exactly what you said. It is the fact that we are seeing, particularly in challenged economies like Brazil, we are seeing that value pricing is very important to the consumers there. And one of the things that's been a big focus of ours as we have implemented our supply chain reinvention is the opportunity to have more flexible packaging formats available, so that we can provide our products in a variety of packaged formats at different price points. And so the key for us in competing in, particularly in the emerging markets, with a number of lower-priced local competitors is our ability to create smaller pack sizes of our existing products, and we're finding that is working quite well for us, and that will be a key source of our share gains \u2013 they are actually today a source of share gains and will be increasingly important as we look ahead. Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude the Mondel\u0113z second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Mondelez management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondelez. Please go ahead, sir. Shep Dunlap : Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. With me today are Irene Rosenfeld, our Chairman and CEO; and Brian Gladden, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out two press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website, mondelezinternational.com/investors. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we will be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures unless otherwise noted. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Irene. Irene Rosenfeld : Thanks, Shep, and good morning. Q3 was a good quarter on both the top and bottom lines. Organic net revenue 2.8% fueled marginally by the strength of our Power Brands improving momentum in emerging markets and strong performance in Europe. We estimate that our top-line results included a benefit of approximately 60 basis points associated with recovery from the malware incident as we recaptured some delayed shipments from the end of Q2. Of course, we had some challenges in the quarter from hurricanes, earthquakes and the India GST, but they netted out to a very small number. On the bottom line, we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted operating income margin expansion and double digit adjusted EPS growth. We're pleased with the underlying growth drivers. Our Power Brands grew 3.8%, significantly outpacing the category with Milka and Cadbury Dairy Milk in chocolate and Oreo and belVita in biscuits performing especially well. Emerging markets grew 4.8% including positive volume growth. Key markets have fueled revenue growth included India, Russia and Mexico. We think sequential acceleration in emerging market category growth consistent with our view that these markets are generally improving and we\u2019re well positioned to win as conditions continue to improve. Developed markets grew 1.6%, led once again by Europe. Our performance in chocolate was strong across nearly all of our largest markets in the region. For example, in Germany, we expanded market share on a year-to-date basis with distribution gains and the solid performance of Milka. And in the UK, our Cadbury sponsorship of the Premier League also drove strong share gains. Our growth strategies continue to gain traction. We're contemporizing our core by distorting resources behind our Power Brands and by upgrading the well being credentials of our portfolio. Our belVita brand continues to be a standout. It\u2019s growing mid single digits globally driven by our base breakfast biscuits as well as impactful line extensions like belVita Protein and belVita Bites. RITZ Crisp & Thins with all the taste and half the fat of the leading potato chip is taking share and exceeding our expectations. We\u2019re also increasing our presence in convenience stores. Thanks to our more flexible price pack architecture. And we successfully launched a new savory snack brand, V\u00e9a, during the quarter. We're off to a good start as we ramp up distribution. We continue to make good progress as we fill geographic white spaces. Milka Oreo chocolate in the U.S. is performing well and we recently expanded our offerings to include Milka Oreo mint. The repatriation of our Nabisco brand in Japan is also going well as we recently launched Oreo THiNS and new RITZ sandwich biscuits. And in China, our Milka brand has established a solid beachhead in the chocolate market in its first year. Finally, we continue to drive sales and channel ubiquity for our iconic brands with especially strong progress in e-commerce. Across the globe, we delivered net revenue growth of more than 40% fueled by key markets like China and the U.S. In fact our U.S. e-commerce net revenues have grown more than 70% year-to-date and our China e-commerce business grew at twice the growth rate of the online market. These strong results reinforce our belief in the importance and future potential of e-commerce as the key snacking channel and we've taken the necessary steps to capitalize on that opportunity. Before I turn the call over to Brian, let me comment briefly on North America, which is our only region performing below expectations. We're pleased to have returned North America to positive growth in the quarter and we're making progress in addressing the challenges we\u2019ve discussed previously including recovery from the malware incident. Importantly, we're encouraged by the momentum on some of the strategic initiatives that I mentioned earlier including Milka Oreo chocolate and the rollout of our pipeline of wellbeing innovations and renovations. Additionally, we continue to see our direct store delivery system as a competitive advantage and expect the benefits of this system to play out more clearly in the coming months. That said we have more work to do for this region to deliver its full potential. We look forward to the arrival of Glen Walter next month. Gradually just named as the North America Region President brings an impressive track record of building brands and driving growth in North America and internationally. His operating and sales background has prepared him well to lead our North American business. As we hand the reigns over to Glen, I\u2019d like to take a moment to thank Tim Coffer, who graciously served as Interim President over the past six months in addition to his role as Chief Growth Officer. Tim and his team has significant strengthened the business fundamentals and positioned it for future growth. Let me now turn it over to Brian to provide more detail on the financials. Brian Gladden : Thanks, Irene, and good afternoon. We're pleased with our results in the third quarter, which played out roughly as we expected. Organic net revenue was up 2.8% driven by strength in Power Brands, emerging markets and Europe. As Irene mentioned, we've benefited from the positive net impact of 60 basis points related to the recovery from malware related shipment delays in the second quarter. However as we said to expect on our last call, we also experienced some additional malware related disruptions in the third quarter in certain markets and that negative impact was most pronounced in North America. Overall, we estimate that the year-to-date negative impact from the malware incident was approximately 60 basis points to organic net revenue or just over $100 million of lost revenue across the business. Importantly, we're now confident that the issues are substantially behind us and we're back to pre-incident levels of service and operation stability. Emerging markets grew nicely at 4.8%. Our geographic footprint has always been one of the most compelling strengths of our long-term vision for profitable and sustainable growth. And we continue to see positive momentum in many of these countries in terms of macro conditions, our share performance, improved category fundamentals and good balance between vol/mix and pricing. Now let's take a closer look at our margin performance. We continued to improve margins with another quarter of strong adjusted OI margin expansion. Adjusted OI margin was 16.9%, an increase of 130 basis points driven by ongoing overhead reductions with improved performance across all regions outside of North America. Our efforts in ZBB, supply chain reinvention and global shared services continue to deliver results and we see more opportunities in front of us. Adjusted gross margins declined 60 basis points. Although we delivered improvements in volume and solid net productivity, these benefits were offset by inflation in dairy costs and select investments and trade spending. We are pricing in our cheese business to offset the dairy inflation and should be more balanced as we enter 2018. On the trade spending, we increased spend in a targeted way in North America as part of our DSD initiatives and in Russia and France where we're seeing good growth and strong returns. We continue to feel good about our mid-term gross margin opportunity for a few reasons. First, we're delivering strong net productivity at around 3% on a year-to-date basis; improving volume trends, which we saw this quarter, will also provide cost leverage as we move forward. Second, we're starting to see the transactional benefit of a weaker U.S. dollar in some markets. So, it's still early and there were always be some markets that are exceptions, but this is a good trend for us. In total, our gross margins are up approximately 300 basis points since 2013 and we see continued gross margin expansion as an important component of our 2018 margin delivery. So we feel good about the adjusted OI margin performance and remain on track to deliver a mid 16% outlook for the year. We also remain committed to our 17% to 18% margin target for 2018. Let me now turn to our regional performance. Three of our four regions delivered good results building on the underlying trends from the first half of the year. Europe delivered another strong quarter of margin expansion with an increase in adjusted OI margin of 70 basis points to 19.4%. Strong net productivity and ongoing overhead reductions drove the improvement. Organic net revenue increased 3.2% including a benefit due to the recovery from the malware incident. Our Power Brands in this region continue to perform well driven by solid vol/mix growth. As Irene mentioned, our European chocolate business delivered strong results in nearly all of our large markets while both the U.K. and Germany turned in good performances in biscuits including Oreo, which was up double digits. Our growth was also fueled by our chocobakery business, which generated double digit increases in Q3 driven by new product launches including Milka brownie and Cadbury Roundies. Our EMEA region delivered strong growth of approximately 3%. Similar to last quarter, Asia Pacific performed well while the Middle East was mixed as challenging economic conditions continued though we are beginning to see easier compares. Adjusted OI margin increased 80 basis points to 13% driven by lower A&C spend as we selectively pulled back in markets like the Middle East where we\u2019ve seen lower ROIs and overhead reductions. Our India revenue grew double digits as our chocolate franchise grew share behind ongoing momentum in our core successful new launches such as Fuse and Silk Oreo. China returned to growth in the quarter. Our Biscuits business improved as we launched low single-digit growth, as we delivered low single-digit growth led by our Oreo relaunch. In addition, our e-commerce investments continued to drive solid share gains. Our gum business also grew share while milk and chocolate was inline with expectations. In Latin America, adjusted OI margin increased 200 points to 17.7%, primarily driven by lower overhead costs and improved net productivity. Organic net revenue grew 5.4%, which includes a positive impact from the recovery of malware-related shipments. Mexico continued to deliver solid growth, driven by strength in candy while growth in Argentina was led by pricing to offset currency-driven inflation. In Brazil, improving dynamics in chocolate drove a fourth straight quarter of growth. And as we've said, our Biscuits business continued to face headwinds from price gaps and downtrading. In response, we're making appropriate adjustments to increase the range of our portfolio. Overall, Brazil was up low single digits in the quarter. Turning to North America. Organic net revenue grew 1%. These results were driven by an increase in U.S. Biscuits, partially offset by lower gum revenue. As I said, malware-related disruptions continue to present challenges. The good news is that we now believe that these issues are substantially behind us. As Irene mentioned, we still believe the DSD model provides us with a number of competitive advantages. While the persistent malware-related issues impacted our ability to capture the initial market share opportunities in the quarter, we remain confident that we will see incremental share gains as we move to the next few quarters. Despite the challenges in North America, it's encouraging to see the improved trajectory in our revenue performance and some recent improvement in category growth. Now let me spend a few moments providing some highlights by category. Snacking category growth improved incrementally on a year-to-date basis, now at 1.8%, but our overall share results were mixed. Our Biscuits business was essentially flat, driven by strength in key countries such as the U.K. and Germany, offset by year-to-date weakness in the U.S., which was partially driven by malware-related issues early in the quarter. Approximately 30% of our year-to-date revenue grew or held in this category. As our DSD initiatives gain traction, we expect to see improvements in this metric. In chocolate, our business grew mid-single digits, driven by strong results in India, the UK, Germany and Russia. The U.S. chocolate expansion also continued to be a solid contributor to growth. Approximately 65% year-to-date revenue grew or held share in this category. In fact, our chocolate business has gained more share this year than any other competitor in the market. Gum & Candy declined mid-single digits as gum category weakness persisted, most notably in the U.S. Only about 20% of our year-to-date revenue in Gum & Candy gained or held share. Consistent with our commentary last quarter, our focus is on stabilizing our share within the category while migrating our portfolio toward candy and mints to meet consumers' refreshments needs. Turning to earnings per share. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.57, up 12% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by our strong operating income growth. We continue to expect to deliver double-digit EPS growth on a constant currency basis for the full year. We also continued to reward our shareholders with strong return of capital. In the quarter, we returned approximately $1 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. As you know, we recently raised our dividend by 16%. As our long-term free cash flow improves, we're targeting to grow our dividend faster than adjusted EPS. Let me review our outlook for the year. We now expect an organic net revenue growth of approximately 1%, given the large \u2013 larger-than-expected magnitude of the lost revenue related the malware incident. We still expect to deliver adjusted OI margin in the mid-16% range and double-digit adjusted EPS growth on a constant currency basis. We now expect no currency impact for the year. And with respect to free cash flow, we continue to expect to deliver approximately $2 billion for the year. In summary, many of our global markets and categories are improving, and we remain focused on driving improved top line performance while maintaining discipline around operational efficiency and margin expansion. We're encouraged as we see macro trends that have been headwinds over the past several quarters turn more favorable, including improving GDP, global consumer trends and accelerating category growth in emerging markets and more favorable exchange rates in both developed and emerging markets. In addition, many of our recent growth investments are delivering solid results, including in well-being, in white space expansion and in penetrating other channels, especially e-commerce. As a result, we remain confident that we're well positioned to deliver sustainable growth on both the top and bottom lines over the long term. Now let me turn it back to Irene for some concluding remarks. Irene Rosenfeld : Thanks Brian. For the past three months, we've been preparing for a smooth transition as Dirk Van de Put takes over as CEO next month. Dirk has already been engaged in our 2018 financial planning process, and over the next few weeks, he'll be spending time getting immersed in the business as he begins working with our management team, our board and other key stakeholders. And of course, we expect our strategic planning process will be a key focus for Dirk in the first half of 2018. It's hard to believe that earlier this month marked the 5-year anniversary of Mondelez International. I'm very proud of the company we built and the shareholder value we've delivered over that time. I'm pleased to see the macro environment and the underlying business momentum beginning to improve, and I'm confident that Dirk and the team will build on this momentum to take our company to the next level. It's been a privilege to have created and led this great company and a pleasure to have worked with all of you over the years. I especially want to thank my partner, Brian Gladden, and the rest of my leadership team as well as my 90,000 colleagues around the world for your passion, your hard work and your tireless commitment to our company in the exceptionally challenging environment over the past few years. Through it all, you kept your eyes on the prize, and I truly believe the best is yet to come. With that let\u2019s open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Irene Rosenfeld : Thank you. Ken Goldman : Hi thank you. And Irene, thank you for your help over the years and best of luck to you ahead. I get the feeling that you'll have a more active retirement than most retirees out there, knowing you. So again, thanks again. I wanted to ask two questions if I could. You talked about your commitment to your margin target for next year, but you also talked about the process of strategic planning still being underway. So Irene, if I could ask you sort of put on your Chairman of the Board hat right now. And knowing Dirk, what are his thoughts in terms of the margin targets for next year? Is there much of a risk, in your view, of him tweaking the data a little bit? Sometimes, new CEOs come in and want to set the bar a little bit lower. So that would be my first question is sort of what your thoughts on that. And my second question is and I think you sort of highlighted this a little in your optimism about the environment, but how do you feel, in general, about the environment for you in 2018 and in terms of the sales line? And do you feel like you'll need to invest more in gross margin to kind of hit your sales numbers or is the macro trend going to be enough? Thank you for that. Irene Rosenfeld : So first of all Ken, I\u2019m sure you'll have a chance to engage with Dirk over the coming months. He's actually going to officially start on November 20. He's been involved in a number of areas, as I mentioned, particularly the development of the 2018 plan to ensure a smooth transition. So we start there. Brian continues to confirm our margin target for 2018 between 17% and 18%. But certainly, our strategic plan will be a key focus of Dirk\u2019s in the first half of the year. That said, we fully understand that the margin targets are very much top of mind, and I can assure you that Dirk fully appreciates the importance of margin delivery to our overall algorithm. So I think in the spirit of you've got to wail until he gets here, I think we can give you as much assurance as that. Brian Gladden : Ken, I would just say obviously to deliver on 2018, the plans and actions are underway. I mean, it's not like we can decide that in January and deliver. So there's been a lot of work and Dirk has been very engaged in that process. We also gave you some clarity so we're not giving guidance today obviously for 2018, but we've confirmed the margin target and we've talked about cash flow. We still feel good about $2.8 billion of cash flow for next year. So may be those are two hints as to where we're headed. In terms of the trends that we're seeing in the environment, maybe just a few comments and we've talked about most of these. But the global economy's consumer sentiment, generally improving in most markets. Emerging markets favorable and obviously, that's good for us, given our exposure but I would also say that Europe feels pretty good. It's about 40% of our revenue and it's solid and stable and growing. Category trends, yes, I'd say they've stabilized a bit and some recent improvement over the last couple of months but maybe a little too early to start the call that yet but not a bad trend. North America packaged food trends, I think that will continue to be a challenge, and that's a place that we're planning for that environment to continue. Commodities and currency, I guess I would say they appear to be, for us, relatively stable year-over-year and how you think about that in aggregate. We obviously have favorability in cocoa but we're all set with pressure in things like packaging, and dairy and transportation even. So maybe some overall tailwind there but we're planning for relatively stable. And then maybe the last piece, just as we think about tax \u2013 tax rates, probably roughly the same in 2018 as what we would see in 2018 short of getting some clarity on what U.S. reform looks like. So maybe a few pieces of insight as we think about the environment and how we're thinking about 2018 without really giving you the guidance at this point. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : Hey good morning everybody, or good afternoon, I mean and best of luck to you Irene. Irene Rosenfeld : Thanks Bryan. Bryan Spillane : So a couple of questions. First, I guess as a follow-up to Ken\u2019s question, first just gross margins in the quarter were I guess down versus last year, but operating profit margins expanded. So just in terms of how the P&L shaped, how is that relative to what your expectations were I guess going into the quarter. Meaning, I guess were gross margins in line better or worse than what you were thinking? Brian Gladden : Look, I think they were a little bit tougher. As I said, higher input costs specifically very fast have been challenging over the course of the last several months here. And we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019re now in the process of raising prices, just can\u2019t really raise them fast enough. And then the trade spend, I think we were thoughtful and knew we were going to make some of those \u2013 some of those decisions to spend some of those dollars. But look, I would just go back to mid-term reality around gross margins. We\u2019ve delivered 300 basis points improvement, it\u2019s about half of the expansion that we\u2019ve delivered over the last few years. And we\u2019re executing pretty well, I mean our execution was as expected around net productivity and the COGS reduction program that we have. So I think the one out layer was really very fast and how we sort to have to manage that across the cheese business. Bryan Spillane : And then I guess my second question. Just if emerging markets in Europe continue to get a little bit better as we\u2019re looking out, I guess into 2018 and 2019 maybe, can you just talk about how much flexibility there is to invest behind that in your current plans. And I guess if volumes actually start to grow is \u2013 how that affects leverage and maybe the margin expansion. We\u2019ve been also focused on cost reductions to drive margins, but could you get sense that there\u2019s some volume growth, just how that might affect the margins and margin expansion? Brian Gladden : Yes, Brian. I mean that\u2019s obviously we saw the early stages of some volume improvement a lot of it was driven by Europe in the quarter. But obviously that helped us a lot as you think about volume absorption, plant leverage and the capacity equation in the manufacturing world. So I think that\u2019s going to be \u2013 as we think about next year and look at the trends, it encouraging to see some of that volume improvement. And we feel good about the that the underlying dynamics in emerging markets. That is \u2013 we've been distorting to Power Brands. We've been distorting to some of these markets that have seen improvements and India is probably the best example where we\u2019ve been able to put some additional spending up against growth, and I think we\u2019ve seen very good returns for that. So it\u2019s part for the course in terms of our strategy. And I think you\u2019ll see us react as these markets get better be able to put some additional spending supply. Irene Rosenfeld : We also don\u2019t underestimate the impact that the volatile commodities as well as the strong dollar had in terms of our pricing actions, which then put a lot of pressure on volume. So one of the reasons the macro environment improvement is encouraging, is it\u2019s going to allow us to temper a lot of those actions, which should also in turn help volume in addition to the other actions we\u2019re taking. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays Capital. Andrew Lazar : Good afternoon. Brian Gladden : Hey, Andrew. Andrew Lazar : Irene, I was hoping maybe to get a little more perspective from you \u2013 particularly as you head off into whatever you\u2019ll do next, really on the state of the industry. I guess you\u2019ve worked on many different brands and categories, multiple capacities for various companies. And I think even your tenure. I guess my question is, is this time different, because if one listen to many of the headlines about the death of brands and private label taking over and all the rhetoric from retailers and so on. I guess one would be like to think that this time is different even of the industry\u2019s weathered many disruptive forces before and seemingly always found ways to thrive. So I guess, I was hopefully to get perspective there to bolder actions need to be taken. And I know it\u2019s a broad question, but you\u2019ve sat it kind of the nexus of many of these forces for some time and I mean your unvarnished perspective would be valuable? Irene Rosenfeld : Yes, I think as we \u2013 as I have witnessed the evolution of the industry they have been cosmic changes every couple of years throughout that tenure, whether you think about the advent of the supercenter, you think about the rise \u2013 the beginning of the rise of e-commerce. We have seen many different trends and those companies that have been successful have seen those trends coming and have address them. So I don\u2019t think this is radically different, I do think the speed of the changes is perhaps more itself more pronounced than we might have seen in the past. But I have great confidence as we look ahead particularly to what we\u2019re seeing going on the consumer front, the customer front, and the channel shift that we\u2019re well positioned. But I do think companies have to take those cosmic changes quite seriously, and have to adapt accordingly. But I don\u2019t believe that this is a radically different set of circumstances than we would have seen in the past. They\u2019re different, but we\u2019ve seen a fairly sizable evolution in our industry over the last decade and the winners have adapted to it accordingly. Andrew Lazar : Yes, okay. Thanks for your thoughts and all the best going forward. Operator : And your next question comes along though Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Alexia Howard : Good evening everyone. Brian Gladden : Hi, Alexia. Alexia Howard : First of all, thank you Irene for your help over the years, and all the best with whatever comes next. Couple of questions. I\u2019m personally on the trade investment that you\u2019ve called out this quarter is pressuring the gross margin. Could you give us a little bit more color on where by geography and by category those might have been steps up? And do you expect those to accelerate going forward? And then the second follow-up question is really around North America. It feels as though there hasn\u2019t been the big push behind the North American chocolate launch, you mentioned that in the prepared remarks. But we had a really seen a big marketing campaign, I don\u2019t believe yet. And similarly with the [indiscernible] taking advantage of Kellogg\u2019s system again you alluded to that being things, that yet to come. Could you just comment on whether we really are going to see some meaningful step ups there? Thank you and I\u2019ll pass it on. Brian Gladden : .: Irene Rosenfeld : As we think about Alexia, as we look to the balance of the year. As we said, we have \u2013 we think we\u2019re pretty well positioned to begin to capitalize on the opportunity in North America. We have significantly put the malware issues behind us as Brian mentioned. We are starting to see the hard work of Tim Coffer and his team has done to stabilize the business and improve our execution. We saw the fifth category turn positive for the first time this year. And we\u2019ve got a number of investments some of which you\u2019ve mentioned that are starting to come into the marketplace. They launch at the end of July. They\u2019ll be the protein is now fully in the market and doing well. Our Ritz share continues to grow behind RITZ Crisp & Thins. We\u2019re pleased with the momentum on U.S. chocolate. We\u2019re up to a great start there both in terms of velocity and repeat rates. So we have a number of the elements that are starting to come together and we are quite optimistic as we look to the fourth quarter and then out into our 2018. Obviously Glen Walter\u2019s arrival will be an important catalyst to build on all of this momentum. But we are quite optimistic as we look ahead. Operator : Your next question comes from long line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Matthew Grainger : Great, hi, everyone. And Irene best of luck to you as well. I just had one more follow-up question on North America. The message still seems to be pretty cautious on the near to mid term outlook, but as I look at results in the third quarter, sales improved quite a bit sequentially, and we\u2019re probably essentially in line with our expectations, and maybe a bit ahead of consensus despite the fact that you have these additional malware headwinds. So I guess, I\u2019m just wondering, is that a reflection in the short term of comps or was there any acceleration in shipments around the innovation pipeline. And then if you move through the process of shelf resets in the biscuit category, can you give us a sense for how that process tracked versus your expectations? Irene Rosenfeld : Yes. So the year-over-year comparison should not have been \u2013 the year ago should not have been a factor. We are truly starting to see our execution come together, obviously we were flying blind in \u2013 on some of our inventory for some of our products over the course of the summer time. But as we exited Q3 most of those issues as we said are substantially result. We are seeing retailers begin to reset their shelves. We\u2019re seeing our displays in share of shelf increasing and we should see that play through as we\u2019ve said in our biscuit shares for the balance of the year. So we are not particularly bullish on the near term North American market. But we do believe that our business within that environment should start to pick up. Matthew Grainger : Okay. Brian Gladden : Yes, I think it\u2019s little early and we\u2019re seeing some improvement in the overall category trends in there in North American U.S. biscuits. But I think it\u2019s a really early to declare that that\u2019s headed in the right direction. Matthew Grainger : Okay, great, thanks. And just I guess one more question on biscuits on more of a global scale. Obviously there were some malware related issues in North America. But the market share trends in terms of gaining in holding did weekend sequentially, is that principally a reflection of that malware shifts are there any other areas of market share pressure globally maybe just sort of hotspots from pricing perspective that would have showed up in the quarter? Irene Rosenfeld : Yes. No Matthew, really that the major pressure on the biscuit \u2013 our global biscuit share was North America, in fact if our U.S. biscuit had held share, our biscuits would\u2019ve been growing at around 80% would have been growing. So it\u2019s all about the turnaround in North America. And as we\u2019ve said we have good confidence that we will start to see that improve? Brian Gladden : And the lost revenue related to malware, the majority came that\u2019s truly stuck is what consumptions within North America and in U.S. biscuits. Operator : And your next question comes from the Steven Strycula with UBS. Steven Strycula : Hi, good afternoon. Two questions. The first one be for Brian. Can you help us understand the implied fourth quarter revenue acceleration, X the shift specifically giving some better textures so what\u2019s driving the underlying baseline improvement, you call out emerging markets I\u2019m curious if there\u2019s anything else that you\u2019ve put upon a point on, and I got a question for Irene. Brian Gladden : Yes, look I think there\u2019s reasonably good momentum in the majority of the emerging markets. I would call out two unusual to give us a little bit of help in the fourth quarter. The first being the year-over-year impacted demonetization in India. And then the second would be inventory trade stock levels especially in the Middle East where we had some adjustments. So I think those are two things that give us a little bit better number and in terms of reported results. But the momentum in general is good and that we see continuing. Steven Strycula : Okay, great. And then Irene, if you had another two or three years in your current role, who would you think would be the largest payback or quickest payback on investments that you could have out there for your business, would it be greater sales force internationally in emerging markets what would be the quickest and large payback on your investment? Irene Rosenfeld : You know I have I actually think as we see the economy recovering around the world, I think we\u2019re seeing very good payback in both our developed and our emerging markets. So I would have told you a couple of years ago that the big return would have come from emerging markets. As we've watched the challenges in those markets over the last couple of years, that's been less evident. And at this point, we're getting a very nice return on our investments in Europe. And as North America comes back, we expect to see that as well. Those are our highest margin markets in the world and so that's a great place to invest. But at the same time, we are seeing our category growth come back quite dramatically in the emerging markets. And so that's \u2013 we're being quite planful in terms of thinking about where to invest there. So actually, the recovery of the broader macro environment will benefit both our developed as well as our emerging markets looking ahead. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citigroup. David Driscoll : Great. Thank you and good evening. Congratulations, Irene, on the retirement, and thanks for everything over the many, many years. Two questions for me. First on the DSD. To be clear, did you guys say that the malware issues were what really prevented the DSD team from executing even better during the third quarter? Was that the correct takeaway to link those two issues together? Brian Gladden : Yes, it really came down to our ability to serve and customer service and interoperations. And the results were somewhat challenged by the carryover impacts from malware. So yes, I think as I said, we're substantially past that. We're back to service levels that we would expect in the business and we're going at it now. David Driscoll : Okay. And then just following up on this. If the DSD folks are in the store several times a week, have you seen shelf space gains maybe here in October? I know it's outside your quarter but have you seen shelf space gains in October versus what you were in say, July? Irene Rosenfeld : Yes. I mean, as we were talking about, as we see our retailers resetting their shelves, we're picking up some shelf space as well as we're increasing our displays. And again, those are the actions that we think will help us as we look to the balance of the year in North America. Brian Gladden : That should turn into share gains. David Driscoll : Okay. Last question just on the earnings guidance. So double digits didn't change, but looks like your revenue comments is a little weaker. So then can you put some quantifications on these other things? always going to hate modeling at midnight on this company. So foreign exchange, interest expense. Is the basic message here, revenue is a little bit softer than you thought? Things are still pretty good, but basically everything's a little bit softer? Or are these other items, FX and interest expense, enough to offset any of this revenue change within the guidance? Brian Gladden : David, all I would say is that the real driver of the revenue \u2013 the change in revenue outlook is the year-to-date impact of malware. So as we put all that together, it resulted in about $100 million of lost revenue for the year that we're not going to get back. And that's the pressure that causes us to adjust the top line outlook. Everything else is consistent with what we said and I would say consistent with the trends that we've delivered year-to-date. Operator : And your next question comes from David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. David Palmer : Thanks and congratulations. Best of luck, Irene. A question on Europe. You mentioned some promotional pushes in France and Russia, and those seem to be paying off or at least those targeted ones. And you mention the environment generally feeling better. Could you do your best to break down what is working better for you there? And perhaps tease out what is consumer versus the competition in your pipeline because obviously, you're seeing some spending work better for you than it has in years past. It's been a difficult market. And then what factors, out of all these, make this feel sustainable if you think this turn indeed feels that way. Irene Rosenfeld : Yes. I would say, David, it's \u2013 we certainly did have a couple of tailwinds that made the quarter exceptionally strong in terms of a hot summer a year ago. And we did see a situation with the competitor in \u2013 early in the quarter, a recall of a competitor product that was helpful. But fundamentals are good. And we're seeing very strong category growth. We're seeing strong share, very strong vol/mix. And we believe a lot of that is driven by programming. I alluded to the Premier League tie-in that we have in the UK. has been a sizable factor in driving our shares there. We've been very pleased with our strength in Germany. We've had a very strong performance there. Our chocobakery business is doing very well as we have repatriated the Burtons license in the UK. and across Europe. So there's a lot of actions that we are taking that are driving our strong performance that we would expect will continue. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Chris Growe : Hi good evening and best wishes, Irene, in your retirement. I want to start \u2013 I just have two questions. First would be you quantified the effects from the malware incident on revenue. And I'm just curious how that's kind of flowed through the P&L. So what effect has that had on gross margin or operating margin? Could you give a little more color around that if you haven't done already? I may have missed that. Brian Gladden : We didn't. It's had a minor impact on gross margins as we would have lost some volume leverage related to that. But you can assume it came out at roughly average gross margin rates and then maybe a little bit of volume leverage leakage. We also, as we've talked about and you'll see in the filings, have adjusted out the direct costs that relate to the incident, which year-to-date for the two quarters is now in the range of $50 million. But those are related to the incident in terms of improving our infrastructure and restoring and in some cases, manufacturing distribution logistics related to that. Chris Growe : Okay. And just a follow-up question. As you think about the operating margin improvement that's occurring currently and you expect for next year, SG&A has been lower than I expected. And you've talked about overhead control, I think, across most of the divisions today, if not all. So I'm just trying to understand if there are other incremental restructuring activities that are taking place to achieve this operating margin expansion you expect both this year and next. Or is it just part of the natural kind of the benefit of previous activities that you've undertaken? Brian Gladden : Well, we're still, Chris, in the middle of the restructuring program and that will continue through 2018. We've still got additional programs that we're funding as we speak and then are still executing to deliver. So it's still continuation of the same key programs with ZBB and shared services and all of those activities. So yes, we've still got more work to do there. We've still got funding to do that. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse. Rob Moskow : Hi, thanks for the question and best wishes to you, Irene. I wanted to ask about China only growing low single digit. You did execute a relaunch of the product \u2013 of the Oreo product there. I was hoping for something a little better, considering a lot of other consumer staples companies have been reporting stronger growth. Is there an obstacle to getting back to high single-digit or double-digit growth in China? Irene Rosenfeld : First of all, it's early days on our biscuit relaunch so we're encouraged by the early signs. And we are looking forward to continued performance there. Our chocolate was down a little bit year-over-year because we would have the benefit of the pipeline a year ago. So in aggregate, that was a bit of a headwind for us. Our gum continues to gain share. We're feeling very good about the performance there. So I think net-net, China continues to be a strong market \u2013 will be a strong market for us as we look ahead. And we are pleased to see the early signs of \u2013 that it's returning to growth, but again, there were a couple of variables in the quarter that dampened that overall performance. Rob Moskow : Okay. And a quick follow-up for Brian. Brian, your tax rate guidance is pretty wide. The implications for fourth quarter are very wide. Do you think you can get us to closer to what you expect in fourth quarter and then maybe interest expense as well? Brian Gladden : Yes. I mean, there's always puts and takes, Rob, I mean, there's always discrete items that are playing out. And you can see what our estimated tax rate for the total year is. It's in the range of 23%, 24%. So I \u2013 and that's probably the best I could do, given all the discrete items and the volatility around that. On interest, I think as we said coming into the year, we had a little bit of conservatism in that I think as you can see from the results, we're tracking a little bit below the guidance we gave you, which was $500 million. There are some other income items that were favorable and have impacted that. But the $500 million I would still say there's some conservatism at that number as you play to the fourth quarter. Operator : And we do have time for one more question. And your final question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Good afternoon, guys. Thank you for squeezing me in. First Congratulations, Irene. The value you've created for shareholder since you took over at Kraft has really been impressive so congrats for that. Two questions if I may, first on top line and then one on margins. First on top line, excluding some of the malware stuff, I think you implied if we look at the implication, the front half of the year was growing 30, 40 basis points. And underlying, you've accelerated to something closer to 230 basis points in the third quarter, which is very encouraging. But if I look at your market growth and your market share charts, it suggests the markets certainly ticked up but your shares ticked the wrong way. So it's hard to flip what we're seeing reported results in terms of the acceleration with what you guys are showing on the slide, so I was hoping you could help me bridge that gap. Brian Gladden : Yes, so we set the category is growing in the range of 1.8% and reported year-to-date revenue growth is in the range of 80 \u2013 1.8% at snacking so that's not going to tie to total but that's just snacking and the categories snacking as well. So if you look at that, there's about 100 basis points difference. The largest piece is going to be malware. And as I said, that's 60 basis points year-to-date. And then you would have basically 40 basis points tied to year-over-year trade stock changes, and that's a combination of India, GST, Middle East destocking and we talked about. And then a bit of North America where we built some trade stocks last year and returned to more normalized levels this year so that explains the difference. Jason English : It doesn't really explain acceleration now. So your categories ticked up. So we're categories ticked up if you just run the simple average, they ticked up from around 1.5 in the front half to 2.5 in the third quarter, simple average to get to the 1.8%. You accelerated, by far, greater margin with market share rolling the wrong way. So that's what I'm trying to foot, because if I look at category growth and market share, I would say this quarter shouldn't have looked any different than the front half of the year but clearly, it did, which is encouraging to see. I'm just trying to really understand the underlying component, so we can gauge durability of that turn. Brian Gladden : Yes, I would just say, Jason, that we have seen categories pick up, I would agree with that. I think we've seen our business improve a bit better. A lot of that is a bit confusing because of the malware timing of first half versus second half. I think we've seen stabilization in North America that's improved. And our shares have not been dramatically different. If you look at the total year, we did, in U.S. Biscuits, mostly because of malware, turn to a losing share position, which impacts the metric that we're sharing with you, which is the holding and gaining share. So I think it's reconcilable. We're improving a bit faster than the market in the second half of the year. Some of that's North America has gotten a bit better and I think malware confuses that a little bit. Operator : And we have reached our allotted time for question-and-answer potion.

Dirk Van de Put : Thank you, Shep. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. This is an important moment at least for me since it is my first earnings call as CEO. I am honored to lead Mondelez, and I am excited to be with you today. Mondelez is a great company with iconic brands many competitive advantages and a very strong team. We have a simple yet powerful purpose and vision for the company, which is to create more moments of joy by building the best snacking company in the world. And I look forward to make that happen; for the benefit of all our stakeholders, consumers, customers, community, collogues and you, our shareholders. Today, I'll share my thoughts on our performance in 2017 some of my early impressions and the priorities I\u2019ve been focused on during my first 60 days. I'll also share some perspective on our outlook for 2018 before I turn it over to Brian. Overall, I would call 2017 a solid year. We delivered another strong year on the bottom line. Our adjusted operating income grew by 130 basis points and adjusted EPS was up by 15%. This was achieved largely through a strong operating performance. On the top line, our organic net revenue grew 0.9%. And while that was in line with our latest outlook, we know we can do better. Three of our four regions Europe, Asia, Middle-East and Africa and Latin America, each delivered solid profitable growth. Our emerging markets are improving and we exited 2017 with the brick countries gaining some momentum. In North America, the June Malware into that has significant negative effect on our results for the year. Going forward, we remain focused on improving our performance in this region. Our Power Brands continue to deliver strong results, our biscuit business is solid and our chocolate franchise is growing well around the world. We also returned $3.4 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. So all-in-all, it was a solid year for us given the environment. But we are not satisfied and we know we still have a lot of work to do to get to a stronger path of sustainable growth of both the top and bottom line. It's encouraging to see that we exited the year with an increasing momentum, as our organic revenue grew 2.4% in the fourth quarter. So we are cautiously optimistic we can carry some of that momentum forward in 2018 that, given the strength of our global portfolio, our focus on execution, improving currency and also commodity market trend. So let me turn to my priorities and opportunities ahead of us. When I became CEO in November, I established three immediate priorities. The first pretty obvious, get to know our business, our consumers, our clients and my colleagues. The second, we have to execute our 2018 business plan with excellence. It is the last year of our current strategic plan and so we want to finish the job. And third, lead the comprehensive review to develop a new strategic framework for the next three to five years. As a consequence during the past two months, I've traveled the world meeting with customers, colleagues, suppliers and investors. I have visited all four of our regions, eight of our 10 biggest markets and I plan to continue to visit critical markets in the months to come. I spent that time mainly listening and observing to be able to lead this business with knowledge and to drive that new strategic plan. I've been very impressed by the power of our brand in so many local markets and how committed our colleagues are to winning in the marketplace. My visits have confirmed my belief that our company is uniquely positioned to differentiate itself based on our brand leadership across major snacking categories. Through our attractive geographical exposure, especially in emerging markets, our strong innovation capabilities and a continuous innovation of our assets, we will be able to drive solid growth, both on the bottom and the top line. As you know, we have made excellent progress on margins. We have delivered an improvement of 600 basis points since 2013. Going forward, we're well positioned to benefit from improving market dynamics. We will leverage our competitive advantage to also accelerate our top line growth. It's early, but we are seeing some signs of category improvements in some markets. However, we do have a lot of work to do. We must continue to evolve to meet today's fast changing consumer expectations. We have to be more innovative, forward looking and fast moving than ever before. And we'll have to combine that with excellent execution in each of our markets. And all of that must be done while remaining obsessed with our cost structure in order to stay competitive. Therefore, we're thoroughly evaluating our business to refresh and evolve our growth framework. For me, this deep dive is an essential step to develop the right plan that drives sustainable growth and shareholder value. We will share a little bit more of our approach through the strategic review at CAGNY in a few weeks. But please keep in mind that we still in the initial phase of that review. We expect to complete this highly important work by the end of the summer, and we'll provide more detail at that stage. In the meantime, we remain very focused on executing our 2018 plan. As we think about our outlook, I want to make a few points before I hand it over to Brian. Overall, we expect our top line trajectory in 2018 to improve over 2017. Our category has improved in the second half, but we\u2019re taking a balanced approach to our outlook this year. As such, we expect our organic net revenue to grow between 1% to 2%. As I mentioned before, the only region that hasn\u2019t been performing in line with our expectations is North America. They have a dynamic in a competitive retail environment so solid execution is key. And since the Malware incident last summer, our supply chain execution has been challenged. While we are making progress, returning to normal service levels is taking longer term than anticipated. We do know what needs to be done. And as such, our performance is gradually improving, but we do expect it will take a few quarters to seek all systems improvement in this business. On the margin front, we remain committed to further expansion and expect to deliver an adjusted OI margin of approximately 17% in 2018, including the impact of pension accounting changes. We do expect that 2018 will be another year of double-digit EPS growth at constant currency, which sets us apart from others in the industry. And before I turn it over to Brian, I want to make a couple of comments on the Keurig Dr. Pepper transaction that was announced this Monday. We are excited to participate in this opportunity as we are significant shareholders in this new company. And we are pleased with our ongoing partnership with GAP. We see these as a compelling new platform with the potential for significant admission of value creation for us. Brian will take you through the details in his remarks. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian. Dirk Van de Put : Thanks, Dirk, and good afternoon. We're pleased that we delivered another strong year of margin expansion and double-digit adjusted earnings growth, but we\u2019re not satisfied with our top line growth. Let's start with our revenue performance. Organic net revenue growth for the year was 0.9%, which included a negative 40 basis points impact from the June malware incident. Second half growth was more than 2%, as our Power Brands, emerging markets and overall category growth rates have picked up. Power Brands\u2019 performance continued to be a key driver of our growth, delivering more than 2% for the year. Emerging markets revenue increased 3.6% as we see improving fundamentals across an increasing number of markets, such as India, Russia, Southeast Asia and Mexico. In addition, our ecommerce business continues to perform well, as we grow net revenue growth of more than 40% for the year. Our progress in 2017 supports our commitment to have $1 billion ecommerce business by 2020. In the fourth quarter, we grew 2.4% as we move beyond the impact of the malware incident and we lapped the prior impact of demonetization in India. For the quarter, our results were driven by continued growth in our Power Brands and emerging markets of 3.7% and 6.3% respectively with positive volume growth for both. On a regional basis for the year, Europe revenue increased 1.3%, driven by growing volume and good results in both chocolate and biscuits. AMEA revenue grew 2.7% with exceptionally strong growth in India, as well as solid results in Southeast Asia and Australia. Latin America grew 3.5% behind mid single-digit growth in Mexico, strengthened Brazil chocolate and currency driven pricing in Argentina. Our North America revenue declined 2.4% as we saw challenges in our biscuits business, resulting from malware related losses, a tough operating environment and mixed execution. While we've seen some areas of positive progress in our DSD share gain plans, our service challenges have kept us from realizing all the gains we expected in the U.S. biscuits business during the year. That said, we are addressing our service challenges and we continue to believe our DSD system is a competitive advantage. Now, let's review our margin performance. We executed well during another year of adjusted OI margin expansion, growing 130 basis points to 16.3%. We've now delivered 600 basis points of margin growth over the past four years. Our 2017 results were driven by strong net productivity and lower SG&A. As we delivered this margin improvement, we continued investing in growth programs, funding our white space launches and with total AMC spending of approximately 9% for the year. This is down slightly in aggregate but up in several priority markets. Gross margins were down slightly for the year as commodity pressure and select trade investments offset strong productivity. We're still expecting gross margin expansion will be a contributor to our 2018 OI margin growth, which I'll discuss in our outlook. On a regional basis, strong net productivity and cost execution drove margin improvements in three of four regions; Europe delivered a strong year of margin expansion, posting an increase of 160 basis points to 19.7%; AMEA increased by 140 basis points to 13.1%; Latin America increased 260 basis points to 15.5%; and North America was down 10 basis points to 20.1% as select trade investments and lower revenues limited margin growth. Now, let me provide some category highlights. Snacking category growth finished the year at 2.1% with the second half performing better than the first, while our overall share results were mixed. Our biscuits business grew 0.8% for the year with strength in the UK, Germany, and Southeast Asia. This was offset by weakness in the U.S. Approximately 30% of our year-to-date revenue grew our held share in this category. And excluding North America biscuits, about 80% of our revenue grew our held share. In chocolate, our global business was strong, growing 5%. Highlights included exceptional growth in India, as well as solid results across Europe and Brazil. In addition, the impact of the first full year of our chocolate expansions in China and the U.S. was an important contributor to growth. Approximately 65% of our revenue grew or held share in this category. Gum and candy declined mid single-digits as the gum category continued to face headwinds. About 15% of our year-to-date revenue in this business gained or held share. Turning to earnings per share. We delivered full year adjusted EPS of $2.14, up 15% on a constant currency basis, primarily driven by strong operating performance, as well as good results from our coffee JVs. 2017 was another year of substantial return of capital to our shareholders. We returned $3.4 billion in total and we repurchased $2.2 billion of shares in part from proceeds related to several non-core divestitures. In addition, we significantly raised our dividend in July, while announcing our commitment to grow our dividends faster than earnings going forward. Let me also spend a moment on free cash flow. For the year, we delivered $1.6 billion, which was below our outlook, primarily due to the timing of year-end customer collections and the impact of divestitures. We remained confident in improving cash flow performance in 2018 and beyond. As CapEx spending is now below 4% of revenue, our restructuring spend is coming down and our working capital performance continues to improve, with the best-in-class cash conversion cycle of negative 32 days for the year. Now, I'd like to give you an update on the impact of U.S. tax reform as it relates to our 2017 reported results. We recorded two significant entries in the fourth quarter relating to the implementation of the new tax law, and we adjusted these onetime impacts out of our non-GAAP results. First, we re-measured our U.S. differed tax liability, driven by the reduction of the U.S. tax rate from 35% to 21%, resulting in $1.3 billion non-cash one-time benefit to the P&L. Second, we\u2019re recording a $1.3 billion tax liability due on our historical foreign accumulated earnings. This liability results in a cash tax pay out, which we\u2019ll need to pay through 2026. As you know, we have limited accumulated cash overseas and are not repatriating any material amounts of cash as a result of the tax change. Please see our upcoming 10-K filing for more information on these items. Before I move to the outlook, I want to provide a few comments on the Keurig Dr. Pepper transaction announce earlier this week. As we've said in the past, we've been very pleased with the performance of our equity investments that resulted from the July 2015 divestiture of our coffee business. With the take private of Keurig Green Mountain in March 2016 and under the leadership of Bob Gamgort and the team, we've seen significant appreciation in the value of our 24% stake. This is confirmed by the strong financial results you've seen at Keurig. Similarly, our investment in JDE has also done very well. We think the financial and strategic rationale of this transaction is strong. We believe there\u2019s significant value to be created in the near term through the compelling synergies and long-term as these two strong platforms and their brands are brought together. We\u2019re very impressed with the current management team and see them as well positioned to run this new entity. In terms of key details, we will grow our 24.2 stake in Keurig into a 13% to 14% stake in the new company, and we\u2019ll continue to play an active role in the new entity with two Board seats. In terms of financial impact, we expect this to be accretive in year one for us, while also providing a significant increase in cash dividends. We'll continue to account for this investment through the equity method, and have no plans to exit. We also continue to be investing in JDE and see additional value creation from that platform as well. Overall, we're very pleased with how the July 2015 coffee transaction has evolved in less than three years and the value that it brings to our company. Let me now provide some more details on our outlook for 2018, which we think is a balanced plan based on the environment we see today. We expect organic net revenue growth in the 1% to 2% range versus the 0.9% growth we delivered in 2017. This includes the return to modest growth in North America. And if global category growth continues to improve, we could see some improvement in this revenue outlook. Our first quarter is likely to have revenue growth at the low end of our total year outlook as we continue to work to stabilize our North America performance. We expect to deliver adjusted OI margin of approximately 17%. We're planning for continued strong net productivity and trade spend management as a key focus area. In addition, this will be another year of significant supply chain reinvention as we move more production to our new lines of the future. In 2018, we'll reflect the impact of the new pension accounting rules, which effectively move about $50 million of OI margin to below the OI line with no impact on earnings or cash flow. This is about 20 basis points reduction in our adjusted OI margin. We're expecting to deliver another year of double-digit earnings growth, driven primarily by continued margin expansion, as well as JV earnings growth and share repurchases. In addition, I would note our expectations for lower interest expense due to our ongoing efforts to optimize our debt structure. Our outlook for free cash flow is approximately $2.8 billion, which now represents a significant step up from the past two years. This outlook does include the additional cash taxes relating to the U.S. tax reform. Now, let me talk briefly about the 2018 impact of the recently enacted U.S. tax reform. As you know, we're a very global company. Our geographic footprint and operating models have given us a low tax rate in the past, with most of our earnings generated outside of the U.S. in jurisdictions with significantly lower tax rates. Aside from the two one-time items that we recorded in Q4 that I've already discussed, there're several elements of the new law that impact our ongoing overall effective tax rate. The impact of these items on our effective tax rate in 2018 is basically zero, based on what we know now. As you would expect, we're actively reviewing all opportunities to ensure we're structured as efficiently as possible from a tax standpoint. In this outlook, we expect our 2018 adjusted effective tax rate to be in the low to mid 20s, and likely very close to our 2017 rate. We'll provide longer term guidance on tax when we update our strategy later in the year. Now, let me turn it back to Dirk for a few concluding remarks. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you, Brian. So in summary, we have strong foundational goods in place, and we enter the year with momentum in several areas of our business. Our 2018 plan reflects an emphasis on execution, ongoing improvements in top line growth and continuous actions to expand our margins. And as we develop our strategic plans for sustainable growth, we are focused on how we can optimize and accelerate our strength to create more value for all our stakeholders. As a leader, my philosophy has always been to set thoughtful goals and deliver against them. And as I look ahead, I am very excited about the opportunities to create value at Mondelez. Similar to my attention to consumers, customers and colleagues, I look forward to engaging with the investment community over the coming months and quarters. And with that, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : So I guess we've got a few questions this afternoon just related to the guidance. And I think generally, people are looking at it and looking at the second half organic sales growth that accelerated. And so the guidance implies that maybe that acceleration doesn\u2019t continue. And also maybe even on the operating profit margins, there might have been some expectation that would have been a little bit more. So maybe could you start Dirk just talk a little bit about philosophically how you think about planning and maybe how conservative or how much flexibility you are trying to put into your plans for maybe things that were unforeseen or things that might go right? Dirk Van de Put : Well, first of all, I arrived mid-November. I'm 60 days on board. Secondly, my approach to planning has always been that I try to set very thoughtful targets that I believe we can deliver. So with that we are seeing that we are going to have a top line improvement in 2018 versus 2017, we are seeing 1% to 2% top line and expect that about 17% adjusted to OI margins. It is correct that the categories aren't growing faster in the fourth quarter. But if you look at the whole of 2017 we are the first half, which was pretty low growth and then the second half was a lot better. So we've taken a balanced approach. We don\u2019t think we can already bet on the categories accelerating. And we also want to deliver on those margin expansion targets. So that's overall what I would say my philosophy is. And I think that maybe Brian you want to add a few things to that. Brian Gladden : Bryan, I would just say, we\u2019re being thoughtful as Dirk says and I\u2019d say careful with the top line, would admit that there should be some upside. And as we look at the dynamics, we want to see a couple of things. First, North America is stabilizing and second, laying out really these global category trends, they have recently improved, but I'm not sure that's it's fully sustainable and we want to see that. If the categories continue to improve, there should be revenue growth that's above what we've talked about here. We feel good about the margin expansion. It's in the range of 70 basis points. There is a good supply chain plan for the year. There would be smaller impacts that we've seen over the last few years in overheads, as ZBB and shared services play out, and as you know an improved commodity and currency environment. So we do have more run way on cost in both COGS and overheads as we look at the plan. And we'll work through this as we get through the year. We do want to invest for the long term. So we'll continue to fuel and plan investment around white spaces, innovation, renovation of our product portfolio, as well as funding appropriate levels of advertising and promotional spend, and then on double-digit EPS. Look, we feel good about that too. It\u2019s driven by margin expansion. The coffee JVs will continue to contribute. We'll have buybacks obviously and then lower interest expense. So overall, as Dirk said, thoughtful and I\u2019d say a balanced plan. Bryan Spillane : And if I could just -- one follow-up, on the margin guidance. Is that inclusive of FX? So is there some -- the currency is going to have a much more impact -- be more impactful this year. So just curious is there any effect from margin or from FX in that margin guidance? Dirk Van de Put : There's clearly benefit for us from a weaker dollar. I'd say as you look at transactional impacts, we haven't really factored in specific opportunities there. I think we have hedges in place for the majority of our exposures. We're trying to balance that with pricing actions. So I don't see transactionally a big lever in terms of the margins. I think you'll see it in translation. We gave you those numbers for '18. But in general, there will be some benefits associated with currency that flow through margins, but we're not necessarily capturing those in how we build the plan. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Just following along on the top line guidance for a minute for '18, global snacking category growth looks like, as you noted in the slide, has accelerated maybe even closer to 3% in the fourth quarter. And so if we take the 1% to 2% organic forecast for '18, I am trying to get a sense of whether this is just as you stated, not being certain about how sustainable that better category growth is or is it suggesting that you see continued market share or losses as we move through '18. And the reason I ask is I am assuming you need a lot less pricing to offset negative foreign exchange. And I was hopeful I guess that that could lead to a more of a stabilization in market share, particularly in emerging markets? Dirk Van de Put : Andrew I'll least add a little bit the number, so snacking is up to one. And to your point, fourth quarter was a bit better than that. When you look at the total business, it was in mid ones, right. So you got the cheese business, the groceries and grocery plus beverages that drag that down a bit. This is roughly a share -- a flat share plan as we lay it out. And again if that category growth is better than that again we would expect to see some upside there. Andrew Lazar : And then just I think you basically intimated in some of your prepared remarks that we should start to see a bit of a better balance in terms of where you get the operating income margin improvement from this year between gross margin and the SG&A line. Is it more a matter of just hopefully not seeing the type of volume deleverage that you had the last couple of years, such that some of the work you're doing around the supply chain footprint and the lines of the future and such, can just more fully float through on gross margin or there're other things that play there? Dirk Van de Put : Leverage will clearly help, Andrew, I think as we stabilize volumes that have gotten a bit better. But I would also say that commodity currency pressures as we talked about a little bit are not there. We\u2019re not -- as you see coco pricing has come down. I mean we do have other areas where we\u2019re seeing commodities up. But net-net, it's not like what we've seen over the last couple of years. So we think that will help. We\u2019ll continue to execute on a pretty robust productivity plan for '18, roughly in the range of what we've been seeing over the last couple of years. And we think we\u2019ll be able to drop some of that through. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Ken Goldman : I guess my question is on DSD. You talked about your desire to stick with it, but I guess I would ask why, just given few things right. We have the malware incident I guess exposing some of the unexpected vulnerabilities of the system. I mean your biggest competitor in U.S. biscuits is probably doing better than some feared I mean it\u2019s hard to tell exactly how much of that is unique, because of your challenges right. We have the higher cost of transportation and some of your bigger customers are demanding much better fill rates, they\u2019re trying to get trucks out of their parking lot. So I guess I'm curious where is the evidence that we can see on the outside anyway that DSD is really worth the what I guess would be hundreds of basis points to that segment\u2019s operating income? Dirk Van de Put : Well, first of all, I'm just arriving, and to make decision on these it's a pretty important decision. And on topics difficult to read what exactly is going on, we\u2019re seeing the issues that we've been having. Overall, I think it's a powerful asset for our U.S. biscuit business. And so I do want to take some time to go through this and study and see what the cost benefit equitation is for or keeping it or getting out of it. So it's part of our strategic review. We hope to have clarity near the middle of the year. But from my perspective, it\u2019s a bit early to make a decision on that. Brian Gladden : And Ken I would just say, I mean we clearly -- given the malware incident and then the supply chain challenges that follow that with product availability challenges. I mean, we under-delivered here versus what we expected, there\u2019s no question. We have seen nice progress in capturing shelf space, increase displays. And in some channels, we've seen share gains but not to what we expected. We're still tracking it. There is likely some opportunities as the spring shelf resets play out and our case fill rates improved. And we\u2019ll see the progress as we work through that over the next few months. But we will look at this as part of the strategic review, as Dirk said. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. David Palmer : First, just a follow-up on DSD and the malware issue. I think you said those issues were going to be an ongoing drag through the first half of 2018. Could you just give us some color as to why those fill rates would be such a persistent issue, and maybe any color. And then I have a follow-up. Dirk Van de Put : David, it's really -- I mean the malware incident and the specific issues related to that were cleared up as we work through into the fourth quarter. It's just the supply chain really catching up. We've had some specific products where we were unable to build the inventory levels we needed to that move through the year-end and the surge of demand we saw. We've seen good overall consumption trends in that business that it put more pressure on the supply chain. And to be honest, we just have to catch up and rebuild some of the stock levels. That's really the priority for us. David Palmer : And just looking ahead to 2018 and looking back to how your innovation did in 2017. You had some big bets like the Milka, Oreo, chocolate in the U.S., Milka chocolate in China. How would you grade the performance of your innovation last year? What products should be building into 2018 and how does your pipeline look for this year? Thanks. Dirk Van de Put : David, I would say in general, we feel pretty good about it. U.S. chocolate had a very good year. We're pleased with the momentum there, velocity is good, repeat rates have been good, display activity is up, more to do there as we invest and bring some new products to market. Some of the other products that are more renovations and updating of our product lines in North America have also done well and as expected. V\u00e9a is generally in line with expectations. As you know, it's a new brand. It takes a little bit of time to build brand awareness and consumer trial has been an important focus for us. It's highly incremental and I think we feel pretty good about it. But these things take a bit of time to get scale. But in general, the innovation pipeline is pretty good. For '18, continued focus on renovation. There'll be some more renovation as we move through the summer across the biscuits portfolio. There'll be a couple of things we do in gum this year. But continuous to be a focus area for us and we're investing to keep the innovation pipeline going. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Chris Growe : Just two questions if I could. I want to understand in relation to the North American division, do you believe you can grow the margin in that division this year. And then related to that, should we expect that the malware sales are say fully recovered this year, including some of the lost sales or these supply chain issues impede that? Dirk Van de Put : On the first part, Chris, I mean we continue to have margin opportunity in North America. We under-delivered on our commitments this year in terms of margin expansion for North America. However, it's still our highest margin business for the year as you look at comparable OI margins across the regions. Malware was the biggest driver frankly of some of that execution, not only around the top line but around cost. And it was a distraction to the team as the work in the supply chain had to move off of some of the cost programs and into getting in case fill rates back where they needed to be. We did have negative volume leverage in the year and that was a bit of a pressure. So it's still -- yes, the answer is yes. We\u2019ll still see margin expansion in North America. We have a robust productivity opportunity there. Volume leverage again will help as we get that business back to growth. So yes, I think it's still an opportunity to do better even in the rates we have today. Chris Growe : And I just had one follow-up, which was, do you expect any SKU rationalization activity of any size. And then also the craft licenses going back to craft. Does that -- what effect does that have on say the 1% to 2% sales growth for the year? Dirk Van de Put : There's no craft license impact in '18. There's a tiny one it's relatively small later in the year. We're down as you know with a couple of the transactions that we've executed. We're down in the range of a little more than $200 million of revenue from these long term licenses that ultimately go back. The majority of that goes back in the 2020 timeframe. And the broader question around SKU rationalization, there's still SKU rationalization. There is still some of that work going on. I\u2019d say it's a smaller focus now. We've made great progress there and feel pretty good about where we are. We\u2019re down in the range of less than 23,000 SKUs. We started over little close to 75,000, so not much in the way of impacting the '18 numbers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : The first and I want to come back and revisit a couple of points made already. First on North America and I don\u2019t want this to overshadow the momentum you have outside of North America, which obviously matters more. But the comments in terms of the service level, it's a bit hard to flow with the retail off take data that we see, which it looked rather strong. It's hard to understand how retail off take data would be so strong, if you\u2019re not able to fill the shelf's. So is this really an out of stock situation at retail or has the service level effectively result in you being destocked. Is that why the retail off take looks so much better than the sell-in numbers that you have? Dirk Van de Put : Yes, it's been a bit of a mix. I mean we've had some specific SKUs where we've had shortages. We clearly had to do a fair amount of expediting, which is one of the challenges as I said in the margins. But as you look at some of the more recent data, I would just say we\u2019re catching up in some of that. So again, feeling better, I think it will take a little while to get back completely to normal. And we\u2019re having to still invest in some cost to expedite, but that's really the story. Jason English : And I guess you've segwayed into my other question, which is to come back to gross margin. You mentioned that commodities and currency are maybe the biggest swing factors. I was hoping you could put some teeth on that and give us a beat in terms of what commodities may have looked like to you last year in terms of pressure, what you are expecting this year? And then as we try to decompose your margin drivers and bridge us to how we got here. There looks like there is a big mix line bleaking out from here. And I guess my question is, A, is that true and B, is there anything that you think could help us turn that as we pivot into '18. Is gum, it\u2019s like we need gum to turn or what are the drivers that could cause abatement of that pressure? Dirk Van de Put : Yes, maybe the second part first. I think gum is the biggest. I don\u2019t think it's not a new issue. I mean, we've been fighting that negative trend as you look at the last couple or even probably look couple of years maybe even longer. So we\u2019re planning the business in a way that doesn\u2019t expect the miracle to happen on gum. I think as you look at where we\u2019re investing and trying to drive mix, we've got a priority focus in the regions around more effectively managing that and making sure we invest to drive improved mix. So yes, I don\u2019t expect the environment to change a lot and that dynamic to change. But again, it's something we're counting on as we build the plans. In terms of commodity trends, we all talk about coco and the fact that that's down over the last six to nine months. But as you would expect, we haven't necessarily seen that help given the hedging and inventory positions in coco. So that will begin to play out really not even in the first quarter but after that we\u2019ll start to see some favorability. That's obviously a discussion with customers it\u2019s a big part of our chocolate dialogue around pricing as we have negotiations, so we won't necessarily pocket all of that. And then for us remember that other commodities have moved to the opposite direction. Dairy has been a big headwind for us this year. So both cocoa and dairy were negative and they hurt us in 2017. And dairy is even a bigger buy for us now than cocoa, packaging, transportation are other areas where there's pressure. So I would say in aggregate if you look at '18, I don't see commodity deflation as a net positive but it's not a big negative. It was a negative in 2017 and we had to price for that, we had to cover that and we didn't quite do that everywhere. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Alexia Howard : Could you give us a quick rundown on programs in the emerging markets, I am going through maybe the BRIC countries for example. It looks as though there was a nice acceleration in the second half. And just be curious to know where China and India, and Russia and Brazil are? And then I have a quick follow-up. Brian Gladden : Maybe I'll start with Brazil. Brazil has been challenged for us, but it's showing some improving dynamics. I was there about three weeks ago. The currency, as you probably know, is stabilizing and the GDP has turned positive. So our Q4 revenue growth was mid single-digit, so about 5%. In chocolate the category trends are pretty strong. We\u2019ve had 9% year-to-date. We had some share loss in Q4, because of aggressive pricing from one competitor. And in biscuit we launched choco bakery with Lacta and Milka coockies line. So that helped us to recover some of the share. So obviously on Brazil, we are cautiously optimistic. The GDP growth is improving and the currency has stabilized. Though there's still some uncertainty in Brazil, I would say. Russia, we are feeling very good about, so it grew mid single-digit in the quarter, 8.4%. The economy is showing clearly signs of progress with falling inflation. Our team is executing well. The year-to-date category growth in biscuits is 7%, it\u2019s 5% in chocolates. We are now the number one player in chocolate. We did launch our choco bakery in Q3 and then we're off to a very strong start. So we\u2019re encouraged in Russia because of the signs of the economic improvement and the higher oil prices, better GDP and the ruble strengthening. India very strong, we had a 27% growth in Q4, but that's of course lapping the demonetization. Still, we grew double-digits without that and overall for the year, India is up 12%. The category growth for chocolate and biscuits continues to be very strong with double-digit growth for the year. The team I think is executing very well. India, I was two weeks ago and we had some good share gain. We gained about points, a full point in chocolate over the past quarter. And so we have very strong performance in Cadbury, Dairy Milk, Silk, and a bunch of new launches. India for me is a very important market for us as the demographics are very strong. We see a growing middle class. We still have a low per capita consumption of chocolates, about 0.1 kilogram, if U.S. is 4.5 Germany is 8, and the UK is 10. So we also see that we have significant room for distribution in the traditional trade and that is something we are actively pursuing. And the GDP growth rates are pretty strong, so overall very bullish on India. And then China was little bit off for us in the last years, but they had a solid quarter. They had 1.5% growth but that was also due to the late timing of the Chinese New Year. I think we will continue to see some good news coming out of China for us. We have a number of opportunities we launched a Milka magic cup, which is a new offering in our chocolate portfolio. Ecommerce is quite big for us. We had a very successful singles day, and we grew as twice the rate of the market in ecommerce. So the ecommerce was up 30% for us. So in China, I would say we are feeling good and I think we will see some acceleration of the growth rate there in the first quarter. Alexia Howard : And really super quick follow-up, I was surprised to see a bit of a slowdown in the share repurchase guidance for 2018. Is that when you\u2019re planning to use the cash, the improvement in free cash flow that you\u2019re anticipating and see if it\u2019s something else? Thank you and I\u2019ll pass it on. Dirk Van de Put : Alexia, we\u2019ll continue to reevaluate that. I mean we've -- as you know, we did a bit extra in '17. It was driven by the availability cash from some of the divestitures that we did. We\u2019ll continue to look at it over the course of the year. And as you know, we've done more than we would have said in the outlooks for the last few years. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi. David Driscoll : Brian, just a quick follow-up on the inflation execution for '18. Did you '18 would be deflationary in aggregate for your basket of inputs? Brian Gladden : What I'd say, it's about flat, David. There is puts and takes. Coco is obviously going to help, dairy is still up, packaging is up, transportation is up when you put it all together, it's about flat. David Driscoll : That leads into the bigger picture question on your revenue guidance and pricing. So in years past 2014 and 2015, you guys were hit with very heavy foreign exchange headwinds. And as a result, we saw a lot of pricing from the company in various markets when there was a lot of foreign exchange headwind. If 2018 is going to have foreign exchange tailwinds and if there is really not much in the way of commodity inflation, what is pricing do? Is pricing actually down in 2018? How do you guys think about it? Brian Gladden : Over the last, I'd say, five or six quarters David it's been more about pricing has been driven by the hyper inflation area emerging markets. And I'd say developing or developed markets for us, pricing net-net has been relatively benign, it's been relatively flat. And there are places where we put some more promotional spend or trade spend in play and we\u2019ve talked about that from time-to-time. But as you say, commodities and currency in those markets have been relatively uneventful and pricing has been relatively flattish. So I expect more of that. I think we\u2019ll see pricing in general be positive, but it's driven by hyper inflation as we look at '18. David Driscoll : Originally, Brian, I believe the guidance for the 2018 operating margin was a range of between 17% and 18%. You're giving us the 17% number today. But maybe could you just give us some thoughts as to why the top end of the range that you guys have set out some time ago, why that's not really achievable in 2018? And I am not trying to push too hard on this I am just trying to get a sense as to what's going on the gross margin, volume leverage, those kinds of factors as the gain has actually been played out. What influenced you so much to come down to the 17% level? Thank you. Brian Gladden : I would just say continue to thrive to strike a balance, making sure we're making appropriate best investments in the business around growth. At the same time, we have the headwind associated with the pension accounting change. We also have the headwind that -- volume growth and leverage in the P&L has not been as good as we would expect with slower category growth. So again with the progress that we made with another approximately 70 basis points of margin expansion, while we invest to get more balance in the P&L and drive some top line improvement, I think we feel like that's exactly the right plan for where we are. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Rob Moskow with Credit Suisse. Rob Moskow : Brian, just a couple of quick things. Did you lower the operating margin run rate going backwards also? I looked at your fourth quarter presentation a year ago and everything is 30 basis points lower. Is that because of the pension accounting change only or is there something there related to divestitures too? And then secondly a question on free cash flow, I think you said that there was some year-end positioning by customers that hurt your year-end cash flow. But shouldn't that help you in 2018 when that cash comes back to you? And if so, did you consider raising your guidance for free cash flow above 2.8, because I guess you had 2.8 before and now it's still 2.8, so\u2026 Brian Gladden : I'd say on cash flow, you're right. Clearly, there's some timing. We had collections that really were due on the 30th and 31st of December, which was a Saturday and Sunday, and the majority of that showed up in the next week. So we should have a good start. And I can validate that we've seen that cash come in. The reality is we've got an incremental cash tax payment related to the U.S. tax reform that partially offsets that. We've got another one-time VAT related tax payment that we have to take. So net-net, I think it puts us about at the 2.8 and we feel good with that number. Your first question related to the backward looking OI margin. And the one thing I would call out we did have is the divestitures, which had about 20 basis points impact in the margin rates if you take that back and adjust for that, so that's the only\u2026 Rob Moskow : So ex those few things, you would have been at 17.5 here for 2018, I guess? Brian Gladden : That's right. I mean 17.4, 17.5, yes, that's right. Operator : And we have time for our final question. Our final question comes from the line of Matthew Grainger with Morgan Stanley. Matthew Grainger : I guess first question, Brian, could you elaborate a bit more on the benefit you expect from better utilizing the lines in the future and where we are in that process. Are we just right now at the point of seeing some early improvement in category trends and being able to get better utilization rates there? And at what point would you actually be in a position to start thinking about reaccelerating some of the deferred CapEx that you might have put on hold previously? Brian Gladden : Yes, I think we've made good progress. We've talked about getting to 70% of volumes for Power Brands on advantaged assets. We\u2019re in the range of about 60% now as we exit '17, and then '18 is -- we will continue to make progress towards that goal. It really is -- the key is for us getting the volume leverage on those lines and that comes from growing the business obviously, and we've got some volume growth that we\u2019re starting to see in some parts of the business. And then we\u2019ll continue to take actions across the supply chain to move more production from other lines onto those lines in the future. And that will be a focus that plays out. And I mention the factor it continues to be -- '18 will be a year where we have some significant supply chain actions to do that, moving more production there. So still a lot of runway in terms of capacity on those lines in the future and that will create nice net productivity, that's one of the drivers of net productivity in 2018 that I\u2019ve talked about. Matthew Grainger : And Dirk just a high level question about reinvestment. I know you want to make sure that the company is taking full advantage of its differentiated position in emerging markets and the scale of the business there, and reaching your full potential from a top line perspective. Given some of the service issues in North America tostill continue to stabilize that business. Is this a year where we may continue to see a bit more of the near term reinvestment flowing back into developed markets than may ultimately be the case once we get through your initial assessment and the multiyear strategic plan that we\u2019ll hear about later in the year? Dirk Van de Put : I would say that certainly we\u2019ll have a look at it. We need to see how much leeway we have to do that, because we do have to stabilize our North American situation first and that's priority number one. We are going through an analysis where we are looking at what we think the opportunities are that we have in emerging markets and how we could capture those, what type of investments would it need. We\u2019re trying to do that as fast as we can. But if anything, I wouldn\u2019t expect us to make big moves in the beginning of the year, maybe towards the end, we will have more clarity on what is possible for us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc. Operator : Good day and welcome to the Mondel\u0113z International first quarter 2018 earnings conference call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Mondel\u0113z management and the question-and-answer session. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondel\u0113z. Please go ahead, sir. Shep Dunlap - Mondelez International, Inc.: Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO; and Brian Gladden, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website, mondelezinternational.com/investors. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we will be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures unless otherwise noted. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Dirk. Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.: Thank you, Shep. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. I'm pleased to say that 2018 is off to a good start. We have improving top line momentum, as well as continued margin and EPS expansion. Specifically, we delivered an organic net revenue growth of 2.4%, which was underpinned by positive volume growth and pricing. We also benefited from the timing of Easter and Chinese New Year. In addition, several of our Power Brands performed well, including Cadbury Dairy Milk, Oreo, and Milka. Each was up mid to high-single digit. On the bottom line, our adjusted operating income margin expanded to 16.7%, driven by lower SG&A costs and productivity savings, while the adjusted EPS increased nearly 10% at constant currency. We are also encouraged by snacking category growth, especially in emerging markets, where we generate about 40% of our net revenue. While we certainly have opportunities for improvement, we're moving in the right direction with competitive advantages that set us apart from many of our peers. First, we have a strong stable of iconic brands. Second, our geographic footprint is favorably balanced with about three-quarters of our revenues coming from outside of North America. And third, we maintain leading positions in snacking, where global category growth trends are improving. With these powerful assets, I remain confident that our company is well positioned to succeed. As I outlined at CAGNY in February, I believe the key to unlocking more value for shareholders is based on a couple of simple concepts. First, we need to put the consumer at the center of everything we do. That means we need to evolve our understanding of when and why consumers snack and how we best deliver on those needs. And second, we must execute with excellence every day. Over the past few years, our focus has been on significant margin improvement through restructuring. And as we've implemented changes, we have opportunities to improve how we function on a day-to-day basis. These two simple mandates are critical to delivering our 2018 plan. And they will underpin the strategic framework to deliver further sustainable growth over the long term that we will talk about in September. So let me now illustrate with a few examples from the quarter, where we're winning in the marketplace. I'll start in Europe, where we delivered excellent results in both biscuits and chocolates, driven by strong volume mix. Across the region, we continue to build our fast-growing chocobakery platform, which is up more than 20%. Chocobakery is a franchise that uniquely leverages our strength, because it lives at the crossroads between our iconic chocolates and biscuit brands. Combining Milka or Cadbury Chocolate with Oreo cookies or Ritz crackers is a consumer proposition that is hard to beat. In addition, our European team executed well on our Easter plans and expanded our gifting and premium platforms in many key markets. Switching to the UK, our chocolate business grew double digits. And here also, our chocobakery platform continued to shine, supported by the launch of Cadbury Freddo Biscuits. In Russia, our business was up mid-teens, with strong results both in biscuits and in chocolates. In fact, our chocolate business recently achieved the number one position in this growing market. It was fueled by recent Alpen Gold Dark and Milka Dark new product launches, which increased our market share by nearly 3 percentage points. I also want to highlight the great progress of our Cocoa Life sustainable sourcing program, which is especially important to many of our consumers in Europe. We know that as we grow our business, we can also grow the positive impact we have on people and on the planet, and Cocoa Life is a great example of doing exactly that. Cocoa Life is a holistic and integrated program that not only has helped to increase cocoa yields, but it's also helping farmers in cocoa communities achieve sustainable livelihoods. By the end of last year, we reached more than 120,000 cocoa farmers in nearly 1,100 communities in six origin markets. And what's more, 35% of our cocoa is now sustainably sourced. So just last week, we announced that our Milka brand in Europe will join Cocoa Life, with chocolate tablets displaying the Cocoa Life logo starting from August. Milka will now join other brands that contain sustainably sourced Cocoa Life cocoa, including Cadbury Dairy Milk in the UK and Ireland, C\u00f4te d'Or in Belgium and France, and Freia and Marabou in the Nordics, and Oreo cookies across Europe. In addition to Europe, our emerging markets also performed well this quarter, building on the positive trends from the second half of last year. Volumes increased and we gained market share in several important markets. And once again, India was a standout, with revenue up double digits behind strong volume gains. We also increased distribution across the country and coupled that with improved in-store execution and a number of successful new product launches, such as Cadbury 5Star and Lickables, which all drove market share gains. And the biscuit growth also continued to be strong, which was led by Oreo. In China, we delivered mid-single-digit growth, bolstered by improved sales execution, a good Chinese New Year, and strong results from our recent Oreo relaunch. In addition, China's e-commerce net revenues doubled in the quarter. This contributed to another quarter of healthy growth in our global e-commerce net revenues. They were up more than 40%. Southeast Asia delivered its tenth consecutive quarter of growth, up high single digits. It was led by a strong performance in Indonesia, driven by Oreo innovation and route-to-market expansion. And in Latin America, we delivered mid-single-digit growth in Mexico, led by strength in candy, while Brazil biscuits improved, driven by success in our chocobakery business with products such as our new Lacta cookies. However, these highlights were tempered by our performance in North America. We acknowledge the challenging dynamics in the market, as you're hearing from other CPG companies. But I would emphasize that we are bullish on the long-term strength of our North American franchise, and remind you that it represents only 25% of our net revenues. The fundamentals in the region got better last quarter, with positive volume growth and sequential improvements in biscuit consumption and market share. In fact, the demand for our brands was strong. That said, our supply chain has had challenges effectively meeting all that demand. And this along with our gum mix and overall trades destocking drove the weaker revenue in North America. As a consequence, higher operating costs are impacting our margins. I'm pleased to say the North American team is squarely focused on improving execution, and our customer service levels have significantly improved over the past couple of months. I would also note that we are starting to see the competitive advantage that our DSD system provides, and we are increasingly confident in its ability to contribute to share gains as our service levels improve. As we said in our last call, we expect gradual progress in North America to continue over the next few quarters. With that, I will hand it over to Brian to review our quarterly performance in more detail. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Thanks, Dirk, and good afternoon. We're pleased with our top line growth in Q1, as we saw improved momentum across much of our business. Organic net revenue increased 2.4%, driven primarily by volume. Three of our four regions delivered solid profitable growth, with strength in Europe and AMEA. Our top line grew on a reported basis by 5.5%, as the benefits of a weaker U.S. dollar versus the euro and British pound are now providing a tailwind to our growth. Power Brand performance remains the driver of our organic net revenue growth, delivering a 2.8% increase, with strong results from brands like Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka, and Oreo. Continuing the trends we saw in the second half of last year, emerging markets performed well, increasing 5.5%, with a good balance of volume and pricing. Given this represents nearly 40% of our revenues, this is good news for us. On balance, we're seeing positive pricing for the global business. Increased prices in emerging markets are more than offsetting some negative pricing in developed markets. In Europe, minor price actions have helped contribute to good volume growth. And in North America, pricing is slightly down but consistent with the market dynamics we've seen for the past year or so. On a regional basis for the quarter, Europe's organic net revenue increased 4.7%. This volume-driven growth was broad-based, with strength in both chocolate and biscuits in the majority of the region. We did see a benefit from Easter phasing that will reverse in Q2, but the business is performing well. AMEA posted growth of 3.6%, with double-digit growth in India, strength in Southeast Asia, and solid results in China, which benefited from a good Chinese New Year and the timing of the holiday. Latin America grew 2.2% behind a mid-single-digit growth in Mexico, strength in Brazil biscuits, and currency-driven pricing in Argentina. North America declined 1.8%, driven mostly by trade inventory reductions and gum weakness. Now let's review our margin performance. We delivered a 20 basis point improvement in adjusted OI margins at 16.7%. These results were primarily driven by ongoing SG&A reductions. Gross margins were pressured by three key factors : unfavorable mix, primarily driven by gum weakness; higher commodity costs with benefits from lower cocoa pricing expected to positively impact our second half margins; and higher supply chain costs in North America. While the mix challenge will continue, the other two pressures should subside as we move into the second half of the year. These dynamics, along with our strong net productivity plans, give us confidence that gross margins will improve as we move through the year. On a regional basis, cost execution drove margin improvements in three of four regions. Europe margins grew 50 basis points to 19.2%, AMEA increased by 150 basis points to 16%, and Latin America increased 270 basis points to 18.5%. North America was down 210 basis points to 18.7%, as we incurred higher supply chain costs including freight and logistics inflation. Now let me provide some category highlights. The snacking category continues to show some encouraging momentum, building on what we saw in the second half of 2017. In fact, growth from snacking was approximately 6%. Adjusting for the timing of the Easter holiday season however, we estimate underlying consumption growth of approximately 3.4%. Our biscuits business grew 2.7% with strength in France, Brazil, Russia, and China, and positive growth in the U.S. Approximately 75% of our year-to-date revenue grew or held share in this category. In chocolate, our global business remained strong, growing 4.8%. The UK, India, and Russia all delivered double-digit growth in the quarter. Approximately 70% of our revenue grew or held share in this category. Gum and candy was flat, as the gum business remains challenged. About 15% of our year-to-date revenue in this business gained or held share. Turning to earnings per share, we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS growth, up nearly 10% on a constant currency basis. These results were driven by interest cost favorability, the impact of share repurchases, and our operating performance. We returned more than $800 million in capital to shareholders in total. We repurchased $500 million in stock and paid approximately $300 million in cash dividends, as we increased our quarterly dividend by 16%. Turning to free cash flow, although Q1 is typically a negative cash flow period for us, driven by our business seasonality, we delivered positive free cash flow in the quarter. The improved cash flow was partially driven by the timing related to our year-end working capital balances. Our team remains focused on generating approximately $2.8 billion in free cash flow for 2018. Overall, we're maintaining our outlook for the full year. We're encouraged by our top line progress, as both our categories and our revenue growth are a bit better than we had anticipated coming into the year, but it's still early as this is just one quarter. However, we would say that the cost environment is tougher than we planned. That's especially true in North America, with the rest of our business well positioned on margins. We're still confident that our overall gross margins will improve as we move through the year, and we remain committed to delivering adjusted OI margins of approximately 17%, as well as double-digit adjusted EPS growth. You'll see in our presentation that we've lowered our view on the expected tax rate to the low 20% range for the year. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect top line growth to be higher than Q1, as we lap the negative impact of the malware incident from last year. I'd also remind you that the second quarter is seasonally more challenged in terms of margins. This year will be also impacted by continued commodity cost headwinds and cost pressure in North America. Given these dynamics, we expect Q2 adjusted OI margins to be sequentially lower than Q1, but in line with our expectations for how the year would play out. Now, let me turn it back to Dirk for some concluding remarks. Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.: Thanks, Brian. So, I would say Q1 performance was good. We saw improved category growth and consumption trends, and we had solid performance from our Power Brands. We're optimistic, but it's early in the year. And we still have work to do as we focus on executing on our 2018 plan with excellence. As it relates to the bigger picture, we feel encouraged about many of the trends we're seeing in some of our biggest markets outside of the U.S. With an international business that represents 75% of our net revenues, we believe we are well positioned to take advantage of these trends over the coming quarters. Before I conclude, I would like to update you quickly on the status of our strategic review. As I've told you a few times, we've taken a fresh outside-in look at everything we do. We want to best position ourselves to generate sustainable value creation in the years to come. We are making good progress with the process, and we remain on target to complete this work at the end of the summer. So we'll share more details with you at that time. With that, let's open the line for questions. Operator : Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good afternoon, everybody. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Hey, Andrew. Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.: Hi. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Hi. I was hoping we could start, I guess, with North America just because despite modest expectations coming in, it's probably the segment that was still weaker than most had modeled. I was hoping you could provide, I guess, a bit more detail on why, I guess, organic sales would have decelerated sequentially in the region, even though we're almost a year out from the initial sort of malware incident. And my sense that with respect to some \u2013 I think you made a comment around some inventory deloading, I guess that I was under the impression that that was harder to sort of get into a problem with, with a DSD organization, where there's not as much sort of inventory sitting around. So hopefully that'd be the first part of North America. Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.: Okay. All right. Thanks, Andrew. Well, before I go a little bit deeper, I would like to say that we feel strongly about our North American business. We think it's well positioned for long-term profitable growth, and the reason that I'm saying that is, first of all, we are the number one player in the biscuit market. I think we have great brands with Oreo, Velveeta, Chips Ahoy!, we do have that differentiation from DSD, and we are improving our supply chain capability and performance, we're including recent investments. And we have new leadership in place with Glen Walter, and we are quite pleased with how much progress he's making in the operations. We do see the challenging environment. There are retailer pressures, as you know. There are changing channel dynamics, shifting more of the business into different channels, and everybody has talked about this higher logistics cost. But we've seen very positive signs as it relates to the consumer in the market. The spending is strong. The snacking categories have been improving. Our consumption is increasing above the market. And we see no real dramatic change in the pricing environment. So Q1, the pricing change is similar to the rest of 2017. So first of all, why is the top line growth negative still? The first reason is you have to see with mix. We have a mix between gum and biscuits mainly. And the gum business is still in decline. Secondly, the retailers are decreasing inventories. And the reason why we are also experiencing that is they're switching to automatic systems. So, our DSD group or sales force cannot necessarily influence that. And thirdly, the pricing, while similar in trend, is still going down roughly about half a percentage point. So, pricing-wise as I said, that's in line with what we've seen in the past years. But \u2013 and we also did some trade promotional spending in a few isolated spaces that had pretty good returns on it. And we're seeing as a consequence biscuit consumption and share improvement, so our consumption is up in the market. We don't quite yet see that in revenue because of what I was explaining. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.: So those are largely the reasons I would say that we still are seeing that lag in our revenue. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. One for Brian as a follow-up would just be, I think on the last call, you had mentioned that your expectation would be that overall gross margin would expand for the full year. Would that still be your expectation? Obviously, I think it would be more second-half loaded at this point, but would that still be a reasonable expectation? And if so, kind of what's the key driver there? Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: It is, Andrew. We still expect that. We fully expected lower margins in the first half as we built our plans and rolled them out. In the quarter, what I would say the drivers of gross margin were we had some unfavorable mix, and Dirk talked about gum on a global basis. That's one of the challenges, it's higher profitability, as you know. I think that'll continue. That's a headwind that we knew about coming into the year, and it's about what we expected. Commodity cost is really a timing challenge given the hedge positions we had, given inventory levels in cocoa especially, but also in dairy and packaging. And as you know, we've been raising prices in the cheese business because of dairy inflation. And we'll begin to sort of lap or get ahead of the inflation in the second quarter. And then the higher supply chain costs in North America. And again, as Dirk said, I mean, I think we believe we'll see sequential improvement there as we work on supply chain cost as we get ahead of freight inflation that you're seeing across the business. So, I'd say the biggest driver is the expectation. And frankly, we know it, because of where we are in hedge positions. But commodities in the second half will be significantly better than the first half, and then again, getting ahead on supply chain costs in North America. And we're making progress there and we feel good about that. So, maybe another way to think about gross margins, I'd say, on an aggregate total global basis, pricing, net productivity, and volume leverage were contributors to improving gross margins. So they helped gross margins in the quarter. And then the mix and commodity costs were pressures to gross margin in the quarter. And even though net productivity was a help and positive, it was lower than expected because of the North America dynamic. So... Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: ...we do see that gross margins should improve sequentially as we move through the year, and for the total year, we still believe they should be up. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Great, thanks to you both. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yeah. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Hi, Bryan. Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.: Hi, Bryan. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I just wanted to ask about you had very good margin expansion in Latin America and AMEA. And I'm assuming some of that is because you had good organic net revenue growth. You had some volume leverage, sales leverage. But can you just talk about the factors there that are sort of helping to improve the margin? And maybe as we're thinking about going forward, was there something about the first quarter that was just unusually favorable? Or if you continue to sort of taste that similar sort of organic sales growth, would we expect that type of margin expansion through the balance of the year? Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Bryan, I would say in general, volume is helpful in margins, and it was \u2013 it's good to see some volume growth back in the business. I think when it gets down to it, it's really about executing on that productivity, executing on our net \u2013 our SG&A programs across the company, but especially in these markets. As you know, some of our supply chain work has been \u2013 it was initially more focused in the developed markets, in the latter stages, was more in AMEA and Latin America. And you start to see some of that really begin to benefit the business, and we expect some of that to continue. So, I think the volume was good. And obviously, there's a bit of a benefit from Easter and some timing and phasing in the quarter, but that is a help to the P&L and a help to the margin rates. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, thank you. And just one quick follow-up to Andrew's question, consumption in North America was up in the first quarter. Could you just give us a sense for where consumption was versus sort of your organic net decline? Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.: The biscuit category was up 2.2% in Q1. That's about 1.2% higher than in Q4, and we held share and our consumption increased by 2.5%. So contrast that with our decline of 1.8% in our revenue. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yeah. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good afternoon, everybody. Dirk, I'm sure one of the things that you were looking at in your strategic review is what to do with some businesses that perhaps are not core or may be not contributing to growth. And as we look at gum, it's been in freefall, I hope that's not too strong a term for this company, for years now. It's really only brought up on earnings calls when explaining why North America isn't doing maybe as well as expected. And so it's almost an afterthought, it feels, to at least some of us on the outside. What would it take for Mondel\u0113z to keep this business rather than divesting it? And if it does decide to keep it, what needs to happen to turn this business around, because it feels like it's been a challenge for the company for so many years at this point? Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: I'll take it, Ken. I'd say, as you see in the quarter, it's down low single digits for the company. We're not seeing signs of improvement in developed markets. We've tried, obviously, innovation, and we've taken some cost out of the business. We've invested in advertising and consumer spending. Emerging markets, the gum business is actually up high single digits with volume-based growth, and there's some good markets like Turkey, Brazil, South Africa that are contributing to that in a good way. So there are some pockets of improvement that we feel pretty good about. It is \u2013 as you would know, it's relatively small. It's about 7% of revenue now. Obviously, good profit margins, and I think one of the challenges is, it gives us scale in some important markets. And as we think about the strategic decision or what we might do in the long term, we obviously have to consider that. There would obviously be stranded costs. There's obviously a short-term dilution associated with the transaction. So, I think it's one where it's obviously going to be one of the topics that we spend some time on as we do our strategic work, but again, it's in the short term. I think you'll see some innovation in a few markets this year. I think we're generally optimistic about some of those. We're taking actions to reduce the cost structure, given the growth profile. And as we've talked about, we continue to shift resources, focus to candy and to mints, which I think are obviously markets that are growing faster and have equally attractive margins for the business. So it's a complex process, and I think it's one that we are working on. Kenneth B. Goldman - JPMorgan Securities LLC : That's very helpful. Thank you, Brian. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Good evening, everybody, so two quick questions. The first one, you mentioned that the snack category is now reaccelerating, which is encouraging. Could you give us some color on where and maybe why that's happening? And then I guess the second question is, you're expecting a strengthening of the top line next quarter, and yet you've kept the guidance for the full year for organic revenue growth at 1% to 2%. Are you actively expecting a deceleration in the back half, perhaps against tougher comps, or are you just being cautious at this point? We'd just love to hear some commentary about whether there's something in the back half that might make that tougher. Thank you. Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.: Thank you, Alexia. I'll do the first part and then Brian will take the second part of your question. So overall, the snacks category improved by 3.4% in the first quarter, and that excludes the Easter timing. In the second half, the comparison will be a little bit more difficult because last year, we already saw an improvement of the category in the second half. So we are pretty thoughtful about our targets and the top line. We need to see North America stabilize. And as I said, the market there also is showing some acceleration. As I look at the world as it relates to snacking, I would say that the emerging markets are continued and accelerated. They are now growing high single digits. And then the developed markets also are now low single digits, but also an improvement versus 2017, so we see it a little bit across the board. Europe had some very strong growth, the U.S., as I talked about. We also saw good results in China. We saw India doing quite well, Mexico, as we talked about. So it's sort of, at this stage, a trough developed in emerging markets that we are seeing the improvement of the growth of the snacking market. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Alexia, on the total year outlook as it relates to revenue, I think we are obviously maintaining our outlook for the year at 1% to 2%. I'd say we would acknowledge some potential upside to the top line if the trends that we're seeing continue. As Dirk just talked about, category growth rates and our top line trajectory are both a bit above what we would have expected. But we want to really watch the global category growth as we normalize for Easter and move through Ramadan. And then our North America business, we want to stabilize that as well. So I think to your question around the second half, I think the second half, it won't be negative. I think we will see positive growth in the second half, and we'll lap, as we said, a little bit more challenging comps in the second half. So in general, we're just being a little bit thoughtful and maybe prudent on the top line, and we'll look at it as we move through the year. Alexia Jane Howard - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great, thank you very much. I'll pass it on. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi, good evening. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Hey, Chris. Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. I just had a question for you, a bit of a follow-on. In terms of this quarter and the benefit from Easter, how much of that \u2013 can you give us an idea of how much some of that shifts between 2Q and 1Q around that phenomenon? Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: For our revenue, it's in the range of about 50 basis points that moves from \u2013 that you would adjust the first quarter growth by. Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, that's great. Thank you for that. And just a follow-up question then on, there was a comment about the timing of SG&A spending. So just a general question about SG&A and the degree to which there are some savings in there. But certainly, that was depressed a bit for any reason in the quarter, so I'm curious about that. And then how you balanced promotional spending and A&C spending in the quarter, was there a move more towards promotional spending versus A&C? I was just curious how that balance went for the quarter. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Look, I think we put some trade promotional spend in play in both North America and in Europe. You would have seen that's one of the contributors to the pricing dynamic. I think we feel pretty good about, as you look at the consumption results in both of those regions, that it seemed to pay back good returns, and we'll continue to look at that. I'd say on A&C, no real change to our posture. I'd say on the total year, we expect to be about flat. I think it looks a little down in the first quarter, and that's mostly driven by phasing of how we would have booked those costs over the last year in 2017. So I'd say relatively flat on A&C and a little bit more on trade promotional spend, and you saw how it played out in consumption in the top line. Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay, thank you for that. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: You got it, Chris. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi, thank you. Hey, Dirk, I guess two questions. One was, I think you made a comment that Glen Walter was making progress at Nabisco and that you were pleased with the progress. Can you give me some more specifics as to what he's \u2013 like the top two or three things that he's focused on? That would be helpful. And then also, I think there's a comment here that delivery and service costs will start to ease in the second half of the year. Can you give me a sense of what's driving that easing of pressure? Thanks. Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yes, so it started really with the malware disruption last summer, which threw us off, and we were several weeks without really having a clear view on where our inventory was and how much we were selling to our clients. On top of that, we've had issues in our North American plants as it relates to waste. We were having too much waste, and so they were not really running as expected. Then the third thing that came in there is that we saw, as I mentioned, the demand increasing. So those three factors were the ones that influenced us at the end of last year and also still in the beginning of this year. We're returning to good service. We're back where we should be. We also have reestablished normal inventory. We did that by incurring extra costs. So things we have to do was increase manpower but also go into more over time just to make sure that we assured the right service, we had the right inventories, and we have solved our system problems. The issue that we had with our clients at the end of last year resulted in some returns and a charge of some allowances since we didn't provide the right service into the first quarter of this year. And then on top of that, you've seen the higher freight and logistics cost that we talked about. So we're back, but the costs are still there. They're improving. We still need to get our plant performance under control. So, when I said that Glen is doing well, the first thing that he was focused on is make sure that we get our customer service back in line and that we are delivering what we should be delivering, which is happening. The second thing he is doing is focusing on our performance in our plants and making sure that we get that improved. And the third thing that he is working hard on is to make sure that our plans, as it relates to our brands, are clear, and that we assure an excellent execution during the rest of the year. So those are the three things that he's working on. He's very operationally-oriented, and I can clearly see the progress we're making. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And what's driving the cost improvement on service and freight? Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.: The cost improvement on service and freight, well, the one thing that we will certainly do is improve our performance and our waste in our plants. The freight and logistics, we are working on negotiating better using private shipment as much as we can and switching to rail, but we will still see an effect of the cost of freight and logistics. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay, thank you. Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.: Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great, thank you and good evening. Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.: Hi, David. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Hey, David. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Wanted to ask a little bit more about Europe. Organic revenue is up very strong in the quarter, but I don't think you said what the Easter impact was in Europe. I think you answered Growe's question and said it was about 50 basis points to the full company in the first quarter comes out of second quarter. But specifically to Europe, can you quantify that number? And then really where I want to go with this is I want to just understand that 4.7% and how you think about the kind of ongoing growth rate in Europe. Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yes. So the organic net revenue growth that we saw in Europe was close to 5%. We saw an Easter effect in there, so I would say that we are in low-single-digit as it relates to our real growth. The volume and mix continues to be quite solid, and so we also continued to gain share in several of our markets. And the reason why that is happening is that we are having solid execution and we're having very good growth opportunities in particularly in two areas. One is this segment that we call chocobakery, which is sort of in between our chocolate and our biscuit brands, and that is growing over 20%, and seasonals, where we are every year executing better on our seasonal range. And so that has driven a margin expansion of about 50 basis points. Obviously, if you dive a little bit deeper, it's the chocolate category, which is doing or growing better than the biscuit category, although we're very happy with our biscuit performance, too, we've seen quite good volume mix there. That category is now high-single-digit growth. If you exclude Easter, we are probably mid-single-digit, and our share is increasing, particularly in the UK, which is our biggest market, but also in a market like Russia, for instance. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yeah, David. As you would expect, Europe is our biggest region impacted by Easter, and it's in the range of 2.5 points of the growth was driven by Easter. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: And that just comes straight out of the second quarter for modeling purposes? Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yeah. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. One last for me, it's just on the inflation. Can you quantify, Brian, your expectation for inflation for 2018? And then, I think I heard you right that you said cocoa would actually be favorable in the back half of the year. Can you marry that up with the spot cocoa market and the very dramatic inflation that we see in cocoa prices? Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yeah. So in terms of commodities in general, I mean, as I said, they were unfavorable versus the prior year in the first quarter. Most of that came from higher dairy, higher packaging costs. And as we said, one of the drivers of our gross margin weakness was this dynamic. We've been pricing for the dairy inflation, and again, we get through that as we're getting through the middle of the year. As it relates to cocoa, our all-in cost for the first quarter net of hedges was up from versus the prior year, so that would be different than obviously what you see in the spot market. And that's driven by hedges that we've had in place from last year, and obviously inventory we entered the year with. We do see the cocoa costs helping in the second half, but it's still a little bit of a challenge in the second quarter given hedges, again, that were put in place last year, so wouldn't necessarily match up with what you see in the spot market. So, it's really all about the timing of when we put hedges on, and we've got pretty much the rest of the year locked, and we know what that is, and we know it's going to be favorable year over year and favorable sequentially. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Very helpful. Thank you, I'll pass it along. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Thanks, David. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Good afternoon, thanks for the question. Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.: Hey, John. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Hi, John. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Dirk, I wanted to ask you about chocolate. The market share performance is 70% where you're holding or gaining. I think it's the best you've had dating back to the Mondel\u0113z-Kraft days. So can you speak a bit more to what's underpinning this between normalized price gaps, new distribution, maybe the new innovation? And then with the new innovation, which is presumably at a positive mix, is the portfolio's complexion changing to an extent where you can preserve these market share gains as you go to the next upswing in cost inflation and pricing? Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yes, so obviously, Europe is our biggest chocolate market. And in relation to the question before, I've gone through that. So pricing was pretty good for us as it relates to chocolate. The category itself, as I talked about, grew about 11.9%. If you exclude Easter, we think it's probably 5%, and our revenue growth, which, of course, has a lag versus the consumption growth, was around 5% \u2013 4.8%. So yes, it is true that this is probably our highest maintaining and/or increasing share, which was 65% in Q4. I would say the reasons. I need to go a little bit around the world to give you the reasons why that is happening. In the UK, we have very strong execution. As I talked about in the previous call, we're sponsoring the Premiership. We launched a new campaign, and we've seen share increases there. So we feel that that is something that is going to continue. We've repositioned the brand, and that seems to be working quite well for us. If I go to India, which is another big chocolate market for us, where we have two-thirds of the market, our shares are increasing quite strongly there. And that is a mixture of new launches that we've done, something called 5Star 3D or some new varieties on our Silk, which is our premium range. We're also getting some traction on a product we call Lickables, which is a combination of chocolate and a toy. And we're also expanding our distribution there because of the potential that we still have in the traditional trade. So that's giving us double-digit increases. If I switch to Russia, which is another big chocolate market, there we're also are gaining several share points. That is driven by the launch of two brands of dark chocolate at the end of last year, Alpen Gold and Milka. So just like in the UK and India, I would think that the Russia momentum is also going to continue. And then we have \u2013 and another big market is Australia for us, again, more than 1%, almost 2 share points gain. There, I would say it's driven by strong Easter execution. It's probably not that repetitive. I think we just executed well, and the market there is doing well for the first part of the year, where in general it's a slower market. And then the other big market that we have but there we are losing share, that's in Brazil, because there's very aggressive competitive promotions. The category is growing largely by price increases, but there we have lost some market share. And that's the only market of the big chocolate markets where we are present that I would say that we are losing share. And in the others that I talked about, I do believe we have momentum and that we will be able to maintain that for the rest of the year. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yeah, John. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: I would just say if you look over the last two years, maybe two and a half years, we've been pretty close to 60% \u2013 70% gaining, holding and gaining share mostly in this category. So once we lap the pricing that was required with the last round of cocoa inflation three years ago, I think we've been in great position and we've seen good momentum in chocolate across the board. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great, thanks for that, and, Brian, just a quick one on gross margin outlook. Is there anything that's impactful for you in 2018 in terms of transactional FX? Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Not really for the most part. As you would expect, we have our exposures hedged on the transactional side and most of the year is already locked in. So it's incorporated in our outlook, and I'd say it's relatively minor. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Thanks for your time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks, good evening. I don't want to beat the dead horse on chocolate in Europe in particular, but you mentioned that your cocoa inputs were going to be down the second half. We see commodity prices for cocoa up lately, up significantly or kind of bouncing from the bottom. Are you in a position to be taking perhaps less price than the competition, perhaps not having to lead in your pricing like you did in the past, and perhaps in a good spot with your own contracted costs? Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Look, we're not going to get into specifics around what we might do on pricing, David. I think again, we feel like we're in a good position in terms of our cocoa costs as we look at least the rest of this year. I think as you see, we're managing the chocolate business for growth right now. But again, we feel like we've got the right cost position, and we'll manage that as we go through the year, but nothing specific on pricing. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : And, Dirk, you've talked about executing with excellence, and I think people have in their mind the U.S. DSD in the wake of the malware issue as an area of potential improvement in the near term. But you probably are talking about some other potential wins there, some other areas of near-term improvement that you have in mind. What other areas would you point to for an opportunity there? Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.: I would say, in general, it's the shift in focus that we are going to go through as a company, where in the last three, four years, we have been very focused on our margin improvement. And we've restructured, we've closed plants, we've revamped our organization, we went through MBS. And so that takes a lot of energy in a company. And we've done well, but now we're getting to the end of that, and so we are \u2013 as a company, we see the potential now to really start focusing more on the relationship with our clients, the execution in the stores, and so on. So that, I would say, is one of the biggest shift. As I think about other area that is, for us, possible, one of the areas that I talked about is waste. We have a lot of waste in two areas, in the plants, mainly in North America, but also commercial waste, meaning that we have inventory that we need to destroy sometimes or we don't execute as well on the plans that we had, and that leads to some lost of opportunities. So, that's another area where I would expect us to do much better going forward. And then in general, in emerging markets, it's a game of gaining distribution and being excellent in thousands of stores. And that is sort of a day-to-day execution, you almost have to do it like an army, and we are \u2013 continue to increase our focus on that. And India, as an example, shows that if we do that well and we compare it with increase of distribution, that we can have quite some progress from that. Those would be three examples of where I see excellence in execution really coming through. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thank you. Operator : And our last question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Deutsche Bank. Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you very much. Dirk, I just had a question regarding Power Brands versus non-Power Brands, and I think specifically, I've heard you say before as you go through the strategic review like there may be areas and brands where you might want to lean into a little bit per se that maybe aren't your larger Power Brands. And I'm just curious, is that \u2013 I guess the direct question is like why does that logic work if your Power Brands continue to outgrow your non-Power Brands, number one? And number two, if a large amount of the capital allocation we've seen over the last three years restructuring program goes into these lines in the future, why not scale back some of the kind of secondary, tertiary brands and just go all Power Brands? Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yeah, I would say by deciding on focusing on the Power Brands, what we've done is we've distorted some of the spending. And so internally, our portfolio now, you've on one hand the Power Brands, which are doing well, but we have also the non-Power Brands, which are probably declining more than they would if they would get a little bit of support. And some of these, and I would probably call it the tail brands at the moment, that category, we can still split up various brands that are really old, and it's difficult to revamp them. There's other brands, which are usually very important in the different countries around the world that we have, and that because of our focus on Power Brands, we have neglected a little bit. And those brands still have a lot of potential, and what we want to do is reshift a little bit more of the spending of the Power Brands back into these, what I would call, local heritage brands, and where we have done that modernizing the packaging, modernizing the communication, using much more digital, we have seen quite interesting growth. And so as a consequence, we're starting to see a little bit of better growth coming out of that group of brands. So we're expecting to explore further that direction. It still will mean that we are going to remain very focused on our Power Brands, but we believe that there are ways in which we cannot have the same decline in the rest of the portfolio and get some growth out of some of the brands there. And the overall mix we see is going to be better if we do that. Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Very helpful. And then a quick one for you, Brian. In terms of the KDP transaction, I think you mentioned before that it should be somewhat accretive. Is that baked into your guidance for this year? Or should we expect accretion from that transaction on top of current guidance, whenever that deal closes? Thanks. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yeah. Look, we said it's accretive in the first full year, which, as we expect that, that would be half of it this year, half of it next year. I would say, it's immaterial to the current outlook. It's not that much of an accretion that you would see it in the numbers, but it is slightly accretive. Rob Dickerson - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Super. Thanks so much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation, and ask that you please disconnect.",

Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.: Thank you, Shep. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. We delivered a strong second quarter building on the momentum we saw in the first quarter. We generated solid topline growth, strong margin expansion and double-digit EPS growth. Organic net revenue grew 3.5% driven by both positive volume growth and solid pricing. This includes a positive impact from lapping last year's malware incident. Our growth was broad based across our regions and categories. This revenue growth translated into a strong bottom-line performance. Adjusted operating income grew more than 10%, and margin expanded to 16.7%, up 130 basis points. Adjusted EPS increased almost 15% at constant currency. We remain encouraged by industry trends. Snacking growth is improving globally and our categories are up above 3%. It's particularly encouraging to see that this growth was coming from both developed and emerging markets. As you know, we have a broad geographic footprint and generate a significant majority of our revenue outside of North America. In a majority of countries around the world, we have a leading position in the highly attractive snacking category as we have a stable of iconic global and local brands. Seeing our categories grow largely everywhere around the world gives me confidence in our ability to drive growth going forward. As I've said over the past eight months, the key to unlocking more value for our shareholders is based on two simple core concept : putting the consumer at the center of everything we do and executing with excellence every day. These concepts are fundamental to our strategy and our long-term growth framework which we will talk about in September. Now, I'd like to highlight a few areas that demonstrate strength and continued progress across our geographies and categories. Starting in Europe, we delivered another solid quarter with strong volume growth. Our biscuit business delivered strong volume growth across most of Western Europe including Germany, France, Italy and Spain. Our chocolate brands Milka, Toblerone and C\u00f4te d'Or also performed well. And chocobakery, which includes Milka and Cadbury biscuits, continued its momentum. Once again, Germany was a particular standout which was up double-digits. Our Milka biscuits brand is gaining strong consumer appeal across the country, which gives us confidence in our ability to continue to expand these products into our other regions. In France, where we've been running a successful Oreo marketing campaign, volumes were up mid-single digit. In Eastern Europe, we continue to experience strong chocolate growth, largely thanks to the strength of Milka. We also saw strong revenue growth in Russia fueled by the continued success of the Alpen Gold Dark and the Milka Dark launches as well as activations around the World Cup. Switching to North America. Organic revenue was up 5.7%, which is partially driven by lapping the malware incident from last year. Recent innovations like Oreo Thins Bites and Ritz Crisp & Thins have performed well. Our new innovation strategy is to start small experiment and bring brands to scale based on what we learn in the local markets. An example of this would be Trident White, which we launched in the few markets this May. We are encouraged by our progress in North America with expanding margins and improving trends in our U.S. biscuits business. However, there is still more work to do. Turning to AMEA. We continue to perform well across a number of key areas where we delivered volume growth and share gains. India continued its run of double-digit revenue growth supported by strong volume. Expanded distribution in traditional trade, successful innovation and strong execution have been driving market share gains, underscoring our market leadership in Indian chocolate. In China, we delivered mid-single-digit growth. We posted good results in biscuits and turned another good quarter of growth and share improvement in gum. Our eCommerce platform in China continues to grow, driven by gifting and personalization. In Latin America, we delivered mid-single-digit growth. Mexico led by strength in both biscuits and gum turned in solid results. And similar to many other companies, our Brazil business was meaningfully impacted by the trucker strike, which contributed to a high single-digit decline in revenue. While we are positive on a longer term outlook for Brazil, we do expect continued volatility for the remainder of the year. Over the past quarter, we also opened two state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities, one in the Czech Republic and one in Bahrain, both focused on servicing our emerging market growth. The factory in Opava, Czech Republic, which will manufacture brands like Oreo, belVita, Milka and Cadbury biscuits, is a great example of our strong commitment to building a positive impact for people and our planet. Operating as a zero waste to landfill facility, the plant uses as little energy and water as possible. The Oreo cookies that are produced here use sustainable cocoa sourced through our Cocoa Life program. And the wheat used in the biscuits is increasingly sourced through our Harmony program which promotes biodiversity and clean environmental wheat production in Europe. We are very excited about this program. And last month, we announced plans to expand our Harmony program to cover 100% of European biscuits by 2022. I also wanted to call out two important events that have happened since our last call. First, we closed the acquisition of Tate's Bake Shop late in the quarter. Tate's is a great fit with our portfolio of iconic brands. It expands our exposure to the fast growing premium cookie segment with an entrepreneurial theme that has created an authentic brand with truly delicious product. Tate's is off to a great start as part of Mondel\u0113z International, and we look forward to introducing this exceptional brand to even more consumers. Second, in early July, the Keurig Dr Pepper acquisition was completed. We have 13.8% ownership in that business. Our coffee investments have been good contributors to the company, and we'll talk more about them in our September Investor Meeting. Going forward, our focus remains on executing with excellence and finalizing our strategic review. We look forward to sharing more details regarding our plans with you at our Investor Day in September. Before turning it over to Brian, I want to extend my gratitude to him as he has been an invaluable partner since I joined the company. During his tenure, Brian's leadership and financial discipline has played a critical role in our journey to become the world's best snacking company. He has built a world-class financial organization, and I know that we are in great hands with Luca Zaramella assuming the role of CFO. With that, I'll turn it over to Brian to share more details on the quarter. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Thanks, Dirk, and good afternoon. We delivered solid topline and bottom line results in the second quarter. We continued to see positive momentum in most of our markets and posted broad-based revenue growth across regions and categories. Organic net revenue increased 3.5% driven in large part by volume growth and balanced pricing. This includes approximately 160 basis points relating to three factors : the positive effect of lapping last year's malware event, the negative impact of the Easter shift into the first quarter and the negative impact from the trucker strike in Brazil during this quarter. Similarly, for the first half, our organic net revenue growth was 2.9% including approximately 100 basis points from the previously mentioned items. Both developed and emerging markets continued to perform well for us during the quarter. Our developed markets were up 2.5% in the quarter while our strong emerging market footprint continued to deliver for us, with organic net revenues increasing 4.7% with positive volume growth. On a regional basis for the quarter, Europe's organic net revenue increased 2.8% and was volume driven. We continued to deliver strong results in the region with notable growth in key countries like Germany and Russia which both grew double digits in biscuits and chocolate. AMEA grew 1.7% driven by double-digit growth in India and solid growth in China. This strength was tempered by a weaker Ramadan season in the Middle East and soft results in Australia. Latin America grew 3.8% with mid-single-digit growth in Mexico and currency driven pricing in Argentina. This was partially offset by the impact of the trucker strike in Brazil that lasted 11 days during May and early June which resulted in shipping delays and lost consumption. North America increased 5.7% which reflects the lapping of last year's malware incident. Growth was driven by solid biscuit results which were partially offset by weak performance in gum. We're encouraged with the progress in North America. But there's still significant work ahead and we expect to see gradual improvement in this region as we move forward. Now let's review our margin performance. We expanded adjusted OI margins by 130 basis points to 16.7%. Higher gross margins and continued SG&A improvements drove these results. Gross margins expanded due to net productivity, volume leverage and sequentially improving commodity costs as we expected. We continued to execute on our ZBB program while selectively investing in key growth activities in our SG&A spend. On a regional basis, gross margin expansion and cost execution drove margin improvements in three of four regions. Europe margins grew 110 basis points to 19.2%. North America increased by 130 basis points to 20.8% driven by volume leverage and lower SG&A. Latin America increased by 120 basis points to 15.4%. And AMEA declined by 40 basis points to 15% as a result of lapping a one-time property insurance recovery in the prior year. Moving to category highlights. The snacking category continues to demonstrate healthy momentum building on the past three quarters with growth of more than 3%. Year-to-date, our biscuits revenue grew 4.3% with strength in the U.S., France, Russia and China. Approximately 80% of our revenue grew or held share in this category. In chocolate, our business remains robust growing 4%. India and Russia delivered double-digit growth while Germany and UK delivered solid results. Approximately 60% of our revenue grew or held share in this category. Gum and candy grew less than 1% as the candy business posted low single-digit growth offset partially by soft but improving gum results. Gum declined in developed markets partially offset by mid-single-digit growth in emerging markets. About 40% of our revenue in this business gained or held share. Turning to earnings per share. We delivered another strong quarter of adjusted EPS growth increasing nearly 15% on a constant currency basis. These results were driven by solid volume-driven revenue growth, gross margin improvement and SG&A discipline. We returned approximately $1 billion in capital to shareholders during the quarter and $1.8 billion year-to-date. For the quarter, we repurchased $650 million in stock and paid more than $300 million in cash dividends. In addition, we announced an increase in our dividend of 18% today as we continued to deliver dividend growth that is greater than earnings. Our dividend is up more than 50% over the past three years. Turning to free cash flow. The second quarter was a solid quarter of cash flow generation for the company, driven by continued strong working capital execution and higher cash earnings. Year-to-date, we've generated $650 million in free cash flow which is approximately $900 million more than the first half of last year. Our team remains focused on delivering approximately $2.8 billion in free cash flow for full year 2018. Now, turning to our outlook for the year. We're encouraged by the category growth trends as well as our own revenue growth on a year-to-date basis. Both of these measures are better than our initial expectations coming into the year. On the other side, we see Brazil which represents about 6% of our revenue as more challenging than expected. Taking this into consideration, we're raising our topline outlook and now expect organic net revenue growth at the high end of our stated range of 1% to 2%. Looking ahead, I'd remind you that the comparisons in the second half are more challenging given category growth comparisons and the positive prior year impact of malware-related shipments. With respect to our adjusted margin, adjusted EPS and free cash flow commitments, we are maintaining our outlook for the year. Before I turn things over to Dirk to open it up for Q&A, I'd like to make a couple comments regarding the transition of my role to Luca who will assume the CFO position next week on August 1. I believe the company and our shareholders are in great hands with Luca as our new CFO. He has a strong track record of success over the past 20 years with the company and a deep knowledge of our products, markets, operations, competitors and customers. I've had the opportunity to work closely with him over my time at Mondel\u0113z and have incredible respect for his expertise and knowledge. I'm sure you will all enjoy working with Luca. I'll now turn it over to him to say a few words. Luca Zaramella - Mondelez International, Inc.: Thanks, Brian. Good afternoon, everyone. It's a great honor and privilege for me to be the next CFO of Mondel\u0113z. I have a great belief in this company and I am excited to take on this role after over two decades of building my career working across the company. I've had the opportunity to see emerging and developed markets across Europe, Latin America as well as in North America in corporate. I'm happy to be working with Dirk and excited to enter the next phase of this company. I have personally learned a great deal from Brian and benefited from his leadership and counsel over the past few years, and I look forward to getting to know those on the call over the coming months and quarters. I'll now turn it over to Dirk for some closing comments. Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.: Thanks, Luca. Thanks, Brian. In closing, while we continue to see some volatility across a few emerging markets, we feel very good about the progress we've made in both developed and developing markets. Our business in Europe continue to perform well, and while there is more work we need to do in North America, we are working hard to drive improvement in the region and seeing progress. Developing markets across AMEA and Latin America have mostly improved over the past several quarters except for Brazil, which is expected to remain challenging over the near term. I am encouraged by the momentum that we are seeing in the business and with the strong first half results. We're making good progress with our strategic review and are looking forward to sharing this work in early September. And with that, let's open the line for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey. Good afternoon, everybody. And, Brian, I want to wish you all the best going forward. It's been a real pleasure working with you, and Luca looking forward to working with you as well. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Thanks, Brian. Luca Zaramella - Mondelez International, Inc.: Thank you, Brian. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So, I guess I have two questions relative to the revenue outlook balance of the year. First, I guess in North America, how much progress or how comfortable you feel now that you've got service levels back to the sort of levels that you'd expect going forward, meaning you've got back to full service levels? That is the first. And then, second, I guess, as we're looking over the balance of the year, I understand the Brazil piece is \u2013 it could be a little bit challenging. But it just seems like with the momentum in the category getting better and the momentum potentially set up for improvement in North America as we go forward that why not go above the high end of the range on the organic revenue growth guide? Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.: Thank you, Bryan. I think you touched upon the two areas that, clearly, for the rest of the year require attention from our side. As it relates to North America, yes, we have made some progress. Our supply chain, which is one of the key things that we needed to work on and improve, has shown some good customer service results in the second quarter. And we're seeing some good momentum also from our DSD system. It remains, however, a system that still has a few old plants in there, which are a bit finicky, so we feel good, but we need to keep on confirming for the rest of year that we have things under control, so we're a bit cautious. At the same time, we do see an increasing momentum in the categories in North America and our share performance within that has been better in the sense that biscuits is accelerating and we have increased a little bit our share. And as it relates to gum, the category is doing better and our share decline has improved a little bit. So, yes, we are having a stronger topline. If you take out malware, we're now clearly in positive territory in North America. At the same time, for the remainder of the year, I would say that the comparisons are going to become more difficult because, as you will remember, the third quarter had a positive effect last year from malware, and just overall the comparisons become more difficult. So we feel good about our forecast for North America in the remainder of the year, and we want to see what next quarter brings us before thinking through if it should be higher. Bryan D. Spillane - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you. Luca Zaramella - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yeah. And maybe about the total company, clearly, we are encouraged by the evolution of the topline over the last three quarters and, as we said in the opening remarks, quite pleased about the fact that it is broad-based both in terms of categories and regions. Also pleased by the volume and price balance that we see. And in general, as you saw, we are improving our revenue outlook for the year. In totality for the company, though, we want to remain thoughtful about the second half. There are still some elements of volatility in emerging markets, like Brazil, as we said. North America, good progress, as we've said but improvement is going to be gradual. And in terms of comparison, we're lapping higher growth in the second part of last year and also malware was a positive effect specifically in Q3 last year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good evening, everybody, and all the best to you, Brian. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Thanks, Andrew. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Wanted to follow up, Dirk, a little bit, I think you'd mentioned in the previous answer that the DSD system was starting to see some building momentum. And I'm just trying to get a sense of are there any, I guess, specific metrics that you can point to as of yet that sort of tell you that the company is starting to see maybe what could be a sort of sustainable or substantive advantage from having DSD vis-\u00e0-vis competitors that don't just because of all the malware issues? It seems that that's not obviously been able to be leveraged perhaps in a way that you'd like it to be over the last year. Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yes, Andrew. Well, of course, the best measure for us is our share performance that this \u2013 what will give us the clearest measure. We also, of course, look at our customer service and things like out-of-stocks and so on and that is clearly improving for us. And I think also the fact that we are much more clear on our communication about the fact that we do believe in DSD and we think it can be a differentiator for us, that has caused us to get more confident in our themes (25:51). If we go a little bit deeper, the things we typically look at is the number of displays that we have, what's going on with our share of shelf. And there we see a clear improvement and clear increases. So those are the different factors that we look at to be able to understand how DSD is doing for us. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Got it. Thank you for that. And then, Brian, gross margin came in quite a bit better than we had modeled. Is part of that just that, I guess, the more positive mix effect from a stronger developed market performance in this quarter partially because of lapping malware as opposed to anything else because it sequentially improved quite a bit in terms of the year-over-year improvement? Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yeah, Andrew. That's part of it. Up 60 basis points, we feel pretty good about it. And I think we've been saying it as we move through the year that we expected to see gross margins get a bit better and we still expect them to be up for the total year. I would say mix has been helpful. Net productivity and the supply chain execution actually was good in the quarter. Sequentially, we had commodities moving in the right direction. As we said we had hedges that we're rolling off, gave us access to lower priced cocoa. That was helpful sequentially. Dairy pricing, we've now pretty much got covered with pricing \u2013 or dairy increased inflation we have covered with pricing. And then volume leverage, I think, overall has contributed better absorption and better overall margin. So I think those are the key drivers. And as I said, we feel good about in the 70% commitment for the year that gross margins will still be up year-over-year, so good progress in the quarter. Andrew Lazar - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Thanks, Andrew. Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi Research. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Hey. Thank you and good evening. I wanted to ask about the non-Power Brands. I think in the quarter, you guys \u2013 but correct me if my math \u2013 because you don't actually print this on the slides, but I think maybe growth of the non-Power Brands was maybe a little bit less than 1%. Dirk, now that you've been with the company for a while, can you give us some comments as to what you see is the role of these non-Power Brands? Should they be kind of flattish or low growth? And do you need to invest more in them to get them moving? And then just kind of the final point on this question is, if the answer is not positive to some of those then perhaps some of these should be divestiture candidates, as they would enhance the revenue growth on the residual business. I'd appreciate your thoughts. Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yes, David. I would say the \u2013 and this is a little piece of what we're looking for at the new strategy and we will talk more about it in September. But the way I look at it is we are a company that is composed of Power Brands, which are global brands that are clearly on trend and that are doing well and provides the majority of our growth. But we have also a number of other brands, largely local brands. And those you can indeed divide up in two categories. There's the ones that are quite lost that have potential. They can play in authenticity or a health and wellness role. And we probably have not invested enough in them. And that's one of the areas where we are trying to make the change. And then there is probably a number of them that are not as appealing and that really don't have a clear future. And yeah, we need to see what we need to do with those. You start to see already a little bit of that. Europe has started to shift some of their investments into some of those local brands and we're getting some good traction from that. So I don't think they're going to grow 3%, 4%. But to see them somewhere around 1%, maybe a little bit above that, on an ongoing basis, we would be quite happy if that is what these brands are going to do for us. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. And then one follow-up. On the emerging markets, I think if I read the data right, volumes were down. How concerning is this? And do you expect volume growth to be positive for the emerging markets in the second half? Luca Zaramella - Mondelez International, Inc.: I think when you look at that, take into consideration the fact that in those numbers, there are a couple of drivers, one is Argentina, where clearly we price according to inflation and there is a volume implication there. The other one that came into play in the quarter, it is in the Philippines where we had to price for a beverage tax. And the pricing we took was quite high. It was around about 100%, so there was a volume impact. But we are quite pleased to see the likes of China, India, and Russia actually growing volume. And so in general, I would say, as you strip out some of the outliers I've just mentioned, we feel quite good with the volume momentum we see even in developing markets. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: And David, if you look at emerging in total, vol mix was positive, up 1% in the quarter. David Cristopher Driscoll - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much and, Brian, thanks for everything and good luck. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey. Good evening, folks. Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.: Hi, Jason. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Hi, Jason (31:19). Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey, guys. I'll just echo the sentiment, Brian congratulations, and it's great to see you walk out on a high note with the company kind of humming overall. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Thank you. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: In terms of the performance, it's great to see the sales accelerating. I know there's some noise in there. I think the disclosure in your slides, about 160 basis points of benefit this quarter on organic. Kind of dialing that back around 1.9%, I think for the quarter and for the year-to-date if we strip out that noise, which is relatively solid. But if we compare it to your end market growth of 3.1%, you're still lagging by around 100 basis points which is about where you've been lagging for the last few years. Yet you're showing your percentage of sales at least in snacks that are gaining or holding, materially improving 65%. We haven't seen that I think since maybe 2013. What's the disconnect with those two data points? Why is your market share number kind of getting better? I presume the answer is \u2013 because that 35% that's losing is substantial. And if so, what are some of the drags? And how should we think about their impact going forward? Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yeah, Jason. It's Brian. I'll take it. And as you think about it, I think we sort of got the math at about 70 basis points disconnect between category growth and higher growth. And there's really two drivers. We are net-net still in aggregate losing some share. It's mostly in Brazil, U.S. gum contributes, and those are probably the two biggest. And then there's \u2013 as we talked about in the first quarter, there's an inventory trade reduction that played out in the North America business. Those are the two biggest drivers that would explain the delta. I'd say we feel pretty good about the fact that the share performance almost everywhere else in the world is actually improving and I think we see this gap closing over time. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Very good. That's helpful. You mentioned Brazil. Maybe you can elaborate a little bit more on there because as we listen to various companies, the messaging is kind of all over the place. So I'm suggesting it's better today than last year. So I'm suggesting it's still really choppy. What are you guys seeing in the marketplace? You kind of sound as somewhat cautionary note. Is that driven more by end market growth, more by market share? Can you just give us some more context and color around that? Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yes. I would say first of all Brazil is important for us as it probably is for some other companies too. It's about 6% of our revenue. And we certainly see heightened volatility. You had the truckers strike in this quarter, which has kind of thrown off the quarter, probably had about a $20 million impact on the topline. We think that was lost consumption as the product was not in the store and the consumer really couldn't get to the store. We don't think in a category like snacking that is going to come back. So that's going to affect the rest of the year. You've probably seen that the exchange rate also has started to move that is giving us some volatility. And there's also some social and political unrest in Brazil. So on the short term for the rest of the year, we're sort of expecting that the consumer confidence and the consumer behavior will be affected. And so we expect more disruption and bit of a difficult time for the second half of the year. On top of that, we have \u2013 and maybe we've reported on this a few times, we're doing quite well in biscuits and in gum. But in the chocolate markets, we've had some heavy competitive pressure. So we're faced with that also. Longer term, I think, yes, the observation that Brazil is doing better that the GDP is improving. And I would say probably over the midterm, we are more positive about Brazil. But I wouldn't dare to say that the second half of the year will already bring us a much improved situation. Jason English - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Understood. Thanks a lot guys. I'll pass it on. Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.: Okay. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Thanks, Jason. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Hi. I guess I'll ask about the cocoa cost comment. You said that hedges rolled over, Brian, which was a benefit to gross margin in the second quarter. But we're all kind of looking at cocoa cost as being inflationary. I know you have hedges that protect you for a while and protect Mondel\u0113z for a while. So what's the outlook for when the costs start to get higher instead of lower for the margin profile? Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yeah. Look, I think Rob it's moved around a little bit. I mean it's actually down a little recently. When you look at it in the scale of sort of a five-year cycle of where cocoa has been, it's actually pretty reasonably priced. And we feel okay with that and we've been locking in a little bit longer than we otherwise would given that dynamic. It's going to be slightly favorable for us in the second half of the year sequentially and year-over-year. And then first half of next year, it feels about the same based on what we have kind of in place already. So we're not really worried about where cocoa is. It hasn't moved a whole lot. I'd say dairy has come down a little bit. And if you look more broadly, not a whole lot of new changes to the commodity environment for us in terms of our key commodities. Crude oil has obviously moved up and that affects us in some parts of our supply chain. But we've got some long-term hedges in place there as well. So I mean as we said coming into the year, commodity's relatively benign year-over-year and I would say that's still the case. I would say, as you would have heard from several other companies, clearly, there is some building inflation pressure in some other parts of the supply chain. When you look at logistics and packaging and even labor costs around the world, I would say that's looking to be more inflationary as you move over the next couple of years. And that's something that as we look at the strat plan and start talking about how we plan the business, we're going to have to take into account. But as you look at 2018, I'd say relatively benign right now. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Can I ask you to opine on weak inflation also in your last conference call here as CFO? Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Going forward or what we're seeing right now? Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: What you're seeing right now. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Not a big challenge for us. Robert Moskow - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Not a big challenge. Okay. Best wishes, Brian. Great working with you. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Thanks a lot, Rob. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good afternoon. Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.: Hi, Chris. Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: And Brian, I'll add my congratulations as well. Wish you all the best. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: (38:31). Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: I want to ask if I could \u2013 sure \u2013 about emerging markets and discussion before about volume being up in emerging markets. I'm curious if you took out Brazil, how much of weight was that on sales growth for the quarter? Emerging markets are still pretty solid, just a little below where they were in the first quarter. So I'm just trying to get a little sense of how that one market might've really distorted the data this quarter? Luca Zaramella - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yeah. I think Brazil, clearly, was impacted by the trucker strike. We feel quite good about majority of the emerging markets. You look at Russia, Russia grew quite highly about 15% in the quarter. So it was quite a good number. We are gaining share. The categories are doing well. India the same, volume driven growth. China, mid single-digit growth. So, in general, as we look at developing markets, I think we feel quite good. So I would say that excluding Brazil and the couple of other markets, namely some markets in the Middle East, all the rest grew solidly in Q2. Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yes. Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. And just a quick question if I could in relation to, some of the SG&A related savings, some of the benefit coming through to the operating margin, are those cost saving driven? I guess related to that, I'm curious if you're \u2013 are you moving some of your advertising dollars up to promotional spending still into (39:53) something you've done earlier in the year. I'm just curious how that's playing out and where you're investing those dollars. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yeah. I'd say two things. I mean we continue to work overheads and ZBB continues to deliver for us. We are reinvesting some dollars within overheads into some growth activities. And then A&C, I'd say A&C is down slightly in the quarter, and I'd say mostly timing related. As we've said, we expect the total year to be roughly flat with 2017, and we'll probably have some higher spending in the second half of the year. Christopher R. Growe - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.: Thanks, Chris. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Good evening, and all the best, Brian. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Thanks, David. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Dirk, just a follow-up to your answer to Jason's question on Brazil. It sounded like the trucking strike hit your shelf presence and the comment was or at least part of this was that that would have a carryover impact to consumption, am I getting that right? And does that mean the trucking strike is hurting certain players, like Mondel\u0113z, more than others, meaning this is having a carryover effect to market share rather than just a category or a consumer issue? Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.: No, no. What I meant is that during those 11 days, the consumer bought less product because on one hand there was less product available, on the other hand, since it was a massive issue, consumers didn't get to the store. Since we're in snacking and in foods market, if they don't have their cookies for today, they won't eat them and they won't catch up going forward. They will still consume going forward. But those 11 days, we probably have lost for the year. But there's no ongoing effect of consumption for us. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Shouldn't be an impact in the second half at all. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Got it. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on the comments you made about the Middle East and the weaker Ramadan season weighing on the India results. How much of the slowdown in the quarter was a transitory issue and what is your general outlook for that region? Thanks. Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.: Well, I would say that if I look at AMEA overall, all the signs are very positive. For the first half, AMEA is up 2.7%. We have very good growth in India with double-digit. We have China, mid-single digits. South East Asia is also growing quite solidly. So it really boils down to the Middle East and Australia. Middle East, it has declined double-digits because of the category softness and also some of the economic conditions. The Middle East has been a tough region for us. For a longer period of time, a lot of the subsidies are gone and some of the competitors didn't price and so on. So on top of that, we were cautious with our Ramadan season. And so we see some effect of that. Australia also declined. That was due to Easter phasing, some challenging market conditions and increased competitive activity. I'm expecting Australia to come back. The Middle East, the softer Ramadan of course will not continue. But it's still a region where clearly consumer confidence and consumer spending is affected at the moment. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: And I think, David, we managed the Ramadan fairly well, I mean to the point where I don't see a carryover inventory challenge with how we manage through Ramadan. I think we were cautious coming into the season. David Palmer - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Strycula with UBS. Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Two questions for me. One is a clarification on going back over Brazil. It's very clear that the consumption \u2013 the lost consumption for 11 days. But what I'm trying to get a better feel for is are you commenting that as a result of that strike, was your loss broader consumer confidence loss in that region that is impairing maybe out the door consumption trends for the remainder of the year along with politics and on a local and regional basis? Can you just clarify, if there's any broader underlying trend change for the consumer? Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yeah. No, I wouldn't say that I see a bigger effect on consumer confidence or consumer spending going forward. We do have a little bit of a devaluation, so that will affect consumer prices in Brazil. But apart from that, I think we remain cautious, but we do not see any signs that consumer offtake is affected in a major way. Of course, you have the elections that are coming up which causes usually some volatility, especially in the run-up to the election. So that's why we are a \u2013 for all those reasons, we are a little bit cautious at the moment. But at this stage, we don't see an effect on the consumer offtake. Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : Got you. And then getting back to a question that Jason English asked, to get to that end market, 3% category growth rate over the medium to longer term, does that require dipping into maybe some lower margin pockets of growth, lower ASP products to really capture that runway? Or do you not view them as mutually exclusive and if you fix the U.S. and fix Brazil that you should be able to find that runway and still be able to expand margins simultaneously? Thank you. Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yes, yes. We don't see the \u2013 the first thing you mentioned, we don't necessarily see that as a must to get to that 3% growth. I think if we can get the U.S. closer to the market growth and the same in Brazil, we should be very close to the 3% market growth. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Steven Strycula - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good afternoon and thanks for the question. Brian, I wanted to come back to margins for a second and specifically gum and candy. And actually remember, Cadbury became pretty aggressive in attacking the overheads there prior to the acquisition. And now after owning the business for almost a decade, I also think you've done quite a bit in terms of getting the systems in back offices where they need to be. So can you just talk a little bit about how the cost structure benchmarks in the G&C business, where you see the opportunities for further margin expansion going forward and how we just think about the drivers there? Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yeah. Look, John, I think the gum and candy business continues to be a very high margin business for us. And I think as we've looked at it over time, there are some elements of that business that have a higher cost structure. I mean it's a more intense go-to-market model. The route to market costs more. But as you think about the core gross margins of the business, it's still a very good business. And I think over time, as we've seen the growth slow and the category shrink in some cases, we have taken some costs out. And we've worked to try and maintain those margins. So, it is still a contributor to the P&L. It still drives very strong cash flow, and it's still a good margin business. And I think over time, we have continued to take more cost out, and it has benefited from a lot of the bigger cost reductions and G&A reductions that we've done across the whole company as well. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Going forward in terms of the SG&A, what are you seeing of the further opportunities there? I mean is it more on the outsourcing side with the sales function or...? Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: For the whole company, John? John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yeah, just gum and candy. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yeah. Look I think that will be a topic that I know that Dirk and Luca and the team will talk to you about how we think about gum. It's still in some markets. It continues to be a pretty important element of our go-to-market capability and the scale that we have in those markets. So I think there's places where there are opportunities to grow. And as you know that business in the emerging markets, those guys continue to show growth for us. So continued growth in some of the emerging markets with high margins, that's a good thing. But you can expect to hear more about that I think in September with the team. John Joseph Baumgartner - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thanks, Brian. All the best. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: All right. Thanks, John. Operator : And at this time, we have time for one more question. The final question comes from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hey. Good afternoon, everybody. Brian, best of luck to you and congratulations. Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Thanks, Ken. Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And my question is just kind of layering on the last question was can you talk about the anecdotes or what you're doing in Europe to actually enhance the margins because \u2013 is it a closure of facilities, is there a utilization rate that you're actually improving, is it simple sourcing? It seems like there still is plenty of opportunity in Europe. So you can give \u2013 I know you don't want to go forward, but can you give some anecdotes and some history of where we're going with this and some of the examples of what you're doing? Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.: Yeah, Ken. Look, it's \u2013 I think much of the agenda in Europe has been what we've talked about on a global basis, right. So supply chain reinvention, building capacity and capability with lines of the future that have lower conversion costs and more efficiency, we've obviously done that and added capability in Europe. We've also closed down some facilities and that's contributed as well. They have been as you've seen sort of the best example of a place where we've seen volume growth that's given us leverage in the P&L and that's helped the margins as well. Everything we've done with shared services and G&A reductions, Europe has done that too. So I think it's the broader global agenda coupled with volume growth and a good starting point from a competitive standpoint has really helped that business to shine. And as we look at the margins in the Europe business, they compare incredibly well to other peer companies in Europe and the team has done a very good job with that. Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I agree with you. And I guess my point more than anything else is as the margins have expanded to the level they have and as you said they are exceeding your peers but it doesn't sound like there's really a limit or a near-term limit to them. Is that a fair way of thinking that or is there a reduction or a deceleration of margin expansion opportunities? Brian T. Gladden - Mondelez International, Inc.: Well, I think there's a fair portion of that that's been the transformation of the company has contributed. So with a restructuring driven program that's taken a lot of cost out, we're obviously going to be in a different phase of the transformation and not have nearly the supply chain reinvention opportunity in a place like Europe. So I think the volume growth will continue to be the big lever point for them. And if we can grow on what is a competitive cost structure, I think you'll see margin expansion in Europe going forward. Ken Zaslow - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Great. I really appreciate. Thank you, guys. Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.: Thanks. Dirk Van de Put - Mondelez International, Inc.: Well, I think we've reached the end. Thank you for dialing in. And again, I would like to thank Brian, wish him all the best. It was great to have him here, and as you can imagine, he's had a big impact on the performance of this company over the last four years. And I'm, of course, welcoming Luca and he's looking forward to work with all of you, and thank you for investing in the company. Luca Zaramella - Mondelez International, Inc.: Thanks everyone. Shep Dunlap - Mondelez International, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes the Mondel\u0113z International second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Mondelez International Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Mondelez' management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President, Investor Relations from Mondelez. Please go ahead, sir. Shep Dunlap : Thank you. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO; and Luca Zaramella, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website, mondelezinternational.com/investors. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and the risk factors contained in our 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we will be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures unless otherwise noted. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation. And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Dirk. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you, Shep, and good afternoon. We delivered very solid results for the third quarter. We continue to build momentum on the top line while increasing both adjusted growth and operating margin, and we delivered another double-digit increase in adjusted earnings per share. Our third quarter organic net revenue grew 1.2%, which includes 60 basis points of headwind for onetime malware effects last year, and it was supported by positive volume growth. We also delivered adjusted EPS growth of 18% at constant currency and solid free cash flow, which is now $1.1 billion year-to-date. As I laid out at our Investor Day last month, we are excited about the growth potential of snacking. Vibrant categories like chocolate and biscuits are growing faster than other areas in food. I want to thank many of you for attending and giving us an opportunity to share our vision and priorities around growth, execution and culture. Mondelez is well positioned to lead the future of snacking, thanks to our unique portfolio of iconic global and local brands and our advantaged geographic footprint. Nearly 40% of our revenues come from fast-growing emerging markets, which we expect will disproportionately contribute to future snacking growth. In the third quarter, emerging markets continue to show strong momentum and delivered an increase in revenues of 6%. This was driven by positive volume and pricing with particular strength in Russia, India, Mexico, China, South East Asia and Africa. Excluding Argentina, emerging markets grew 4.5%. In North America, as we discussed with you before, we are working to address several issues in our business which, as expected, continue to impact results. On the biscuits consumer side, overall consumption and our share were positive with key brands such as Oreo, Ritz and belVita performing well, but we have more work to do to improve our service delivery. Over the past couple of years, we've already made significant changes in North America, and we are now producing around 60% of our volume on advantaged assets in the region. We are continuing with additional end-to-end investments in capacity, systems and people, and we are seeing the progress. However, it will take us time to fix and, as such, progress will not be linear. Turning to our long-term growth strategy. I would like to share with you the progress we are making towards our strategic growth priorities. But before I do, let me remind you what they are. First, we are accelerating consumer-centric growth. Second, we are driving operational excellence in everything we do. And third, we are building a winning growth culture. Our long-term goal is to deliver volume-led top line growth that translates into high single-digit adjusted EPS growth and attractive free cash flow generation. Unlocking further growth requires us to put the consumer at the heart of our work. We will do so by further contemporizing our brands, capitalizing on untapped growth opportunities in channels and geographies and overhauling our marketing and innovation agenda. Let's look at innovation in a bit more detail. As I explained at our Investor Day, we're implementing a more agile innovation model founded on the test, learn and scale principle and grounded in local consumer insights. A good example of this is the recent introduction in Europe of Joy Fills, an innovative product platform that we're launching under the Oreo, Cadbury and Milka brands at the same time. Our European team has taken this idea to market in record time, creating an entirely new product format for consumers to munch on. Imagine it as a crispy, pea-sized biscuit with a creamy filling that offers a light, but indulgent, treat. Early indications are positive, and we're looking forward to seeing more. Over in India, our recently launched Lickables product continues to do well with consumers, helping deliver 90 basis points of chocolate share gains year-to-date in a market where we already have strong leadership. And here in the U.S., Oreo, which is already posting a mid-single-digit growth in the third quarter, is getting ready for the launch of the biggest Oreo cookie yet, the Most Stuf edition. While we're driving the test, learn and scale model in local markets, we're simultaneously dialing up our overall commitment to innovation with a platform called SnackFutures, which will be dedicated to unlocking future snacking growth opportunities around the world. SnackFutures will bring together internal and external talent to drive 3 mandates : inventing new businesses and brands in key strategic areas, reinventing smaller brands with untapped potential and creating ventures with early-stage entrepreneurs to seek new businesses. We are excited about the potential of this platform to help us drive the future of snacking. We will share more with you in the coming weeks about this. Another route to drive additional growth is M&A. Our recent acquisition, Tate's Bake Shop, performed well in the quarter, growing strong double-digit, above our expectation, as it continues to ramp up distribution in the U.S. We remain excited about this platform and the opportunity we have to scale the business while preserving what makes it unique. Turning to the second pillar of our strategy. We remain highly focused on our driving -- on driving operational excellence in all facets of our business. In recent years, we have focused mainly on productivity improvements, and we continue to make progress in this area. In the third quarter, we drove productivity even further, which helped to deliver 110 basis point increase in our adjusted gross margin to 40.6%. Beyond this, we are also looking to drive end-to-end improvements in our processes and systems to help make us more efficient and, specifically, to iron out the operational challenges that are impacting North America. Finally, we remain committed to changing not just what we do but how we do it by building a winning growth culture. As such, we are altering our ways of working to provoke a shift in mindset and behaviors. Starting January 1, we will shift to a new local commercial structure that will drive greater consumer focus and reduce the complexity caused by organizational overlap, but we will continue to manage our operations by region to leverage regional operating scale. We are creating 13 geographic business units, each reporting into one of our 4 regions. This move clarifies accountabilities, and we are aligning our incentive structure to drive greater ownership of local business results. We believe this change will enable volume-driven top line growth and absolute profit dollar growth. With the rollout of this new structure in the regions, we will create a more agile company that can react faster to local consumer preferences without losing the benefits of our scale and global expertise in marketing, manufacturing and innovation. We have also announced today that Hubert Weber, Executive Vice President and Regional President of our European business, has decided to retire from the company at the end of January. Hubert has led our European business during a period of exceptional change, delivering a strong track record in terms of profitability and setting up this important region for future growth. We thank him for his 29 great years with the company and wish him all the best. Hubert will be replaced by Vinzenz Gruber, currently President, Western Europe, who brings extensive marketing and commercial experience as well as strong leadership credentials both from within this company and outside. We are confident Vince will step in right away and continue to build on the great momentum we have in our European business. During our Investor Day, I also talked about our purpose, which is to empower people to snack right, a purpose we believe we can fulfill by providing the right snack at the right moment, made the right way. We are already seeing compelling evidence of our new purpose in action. Our ambition to produce snacks the right way, for instance, is manifested in our recently announced commitment to ensure that all our packaging is recyclable by 2025. And we strongly believe that if we make our products the right way, our consumers will continue to choose our beloved and iconic brands for years to come. In summary, our third quarter results were solid. Our year-to-date momentum continues, and we are well set to deliver our commitments for the year. The underlying strengths of our snacking categories, particularly in emerging markets, together with our early progress on our strategic initiatives, gives us confidence that we are on the right track to generate attractive, long-term total returns for shareholders. Now I'd like to turn it over to Luca. Luca Zaramella : Thanks, Dirk, and good afternoon. We performed well across a number of financial metrics and continued to see good revenue and volume momentum as well as solid margin performance that is consistent with our outlook. Organic net revenue increased 1.2%. This top line performance includes a headwind of 60 basis points related to the lapping of the malware recovery. Emerging market performance stands out in the quarter as it was broad-based with strong volume growth. China, India, Mexico, Russia, Southeast Asia and Africa all delivered good results. These results reflect solid execution by our commercial teams as well as robust market dynamics in our categories. On a regional basis for the quarter, Europe's organic net revenue increased 0.2%, though underlying growth was better as these results included approximately 150 basis points of headwind related to the malware incident. Russia posted mid-single-digit revenue growth and share gains in both chocolate and biscuits. And Germany delivered solid growth in biscuit, where the Milka-branded chocobakery portfolio continues to fuel strong performance. AMEA grew 4.6%, with broad-based across all key areas. India and Southeast Asia continue to execute well with high and mid-single-digit growth, while China delivered its fifth consecutive quarter of growth fueled by biscuit and e-commerce. We also saw strong double-digit results in Africa. Latin America grew 4.6%. Although the region was impacted by inflation-driven growth in Argentina, we continued to see good momentum in Mexico, which grew mid-single digits behind both gum and candy. Brazil declined low single-digit in the quarter. We are addressing price gaps and have also made steps around innovation that will help to improve the trajectory of our business in Brazil. North America declined 2%. While we saw positive U.S. biscuits category and share dynamics, we continued to face a number of operational challenges which impacted volume. As Dirk mentioned, we are making investments in people, processes, systems and capacity to address our operational issues and expect improvements moving forward, although it will take time and progress will not be linear. Let me describe what the nature of the issue is. While we have invested significantly in North America over the last several years, creating a state-of-the-art greenfield plant in Salinas, Mexico and installing new Lines of the Future in existing plants in the U.S. and Canada, around 40% of our volume is still made on lines that do not provide full reliability. To compound the situation, volume demand growth is putting more pressure on our network. We are making the necessary investments to stabilize the U.S. factory network while enhancing our capabilities through people and systems as far as supply and demand planning are concerned. We are seeing some progress already, but installing capacity where needed, stabilizing some of the lines, improving our systems and adding capabilities will require some time. Now let's review our margin performance. In Q3, adjusted gross profit dollars grew more than 4% on a constant currency basis. Positive pricing, net of commodities, and productivity savings drove the margin expansion. We are benefiting from favorable cocoa cost, which was partially offset by continued freight and logistics cost inflation. We also continue to maintain pricing discipline to protect our margins in the medium to long-term and have already announced and taken pricing in a number of countries this year, including our U.S. business, while striking the right balance with volume and overall profit. Adjusted operating income grew by 4% on a constant currency basis with margins of 17.1%, up 40 basis points as a result of higher gross margins. There were several items in other income and expense line that were unfavorable when compared to prior year, partially muting the gross profit margin expansion. Cost savings in the SG&A line continue to provide offset to inflation. On a regional basis, gross margin expansion and cost execution drove margin improvements in 3 of 4 regions. Europe grew 110 basis points to 19.8%. North America decreased by 90 basis points to 20.6%, driven by higher conversion costs in U.S. factories and customer service and logistics costs. Latin America increased by 30 basis points to 18.1%, and AMEA improved by 120 basis points to 14.2%. Now let me take a moment to discuss category highlights. The snacking categories continue to display good dynamics and solid growth, building on the past 4 quarters with growth of 2.7%. We remain encouraged by the overall health of our categories. Overall, we held or gained share in 60% of our business. Year-to-date, our biscuits organic net revenue grew more than 3%. Approximately 75% of our revenue grew or held share in this category, including our U.S., France, China, Germany businesses. In chocolate, our business continues to perform well, growing 3.5%. India, Australia and Brazil all posted growth during the quarter. Approximately 40% of our revenue grew or held share in this category, including Germany, Russia and India. Gum and candy growth was flat, reflecting soft but improved results in developed markets. About 40% of our revenue in this business gained or held share, including China. Now turning to earnings per share. We delivered another strong quarter of adjusted EPS growth, which increased 18% on a constant currency basis. These results were driven by favorable operating gains, taxes and share repurchases. With respect to capital deployment, we returned approximately $800 million in capital to shareholders in Q3 and $2.6 billion year-to-date. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately $500 million in stock and paid more than $300 million in cash dividends. Turning to free cash flow. The third quarter was a solid quarter of cash flow generation as working capital management and higher cash earnings drove results. Year-to-date, we have generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow. Our team remains focused on closing out the year and delivering our full year 2018 target with a strong Q4. Now let me spend a minute on our outlook for the year. Overall, we now expect our top line outlook for the full year to be approximately 2%. We are encouraged by our top line results as emerging markets trends and overall category growth trends remain solid. We are maintaining our outlook for the year with respect to our adjusted OI margin, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. As you think about Q4 modeling, second half operating margins should be roughly comparable to the first half of this year. With that, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We will take our first question from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : So two questions for me. One, I guess, just specifically in the quarter, it looked, I think relative to where we were, you ended up delivering much better in gross profit dollars, but the SG&A was a little bit higher than, I guess, we expected it to be. So look, if you could just walk us through, was that more marketing? Did you -- were you better than expected and spent more back? Or was there other sort of noise that we should just think about that flowed through SG&A in the quarter? And then I have a follow-up. Luca Zaramella : Yes. Thank you, Bryan. So quite pleased with the gross profit growth, more than 4%. Gross margin, as you said, up 110 basis points, so delivering our commitments. It didn't translate fully into OI margin as last year we had a few positives into the other income line and, this year, we had a few unfavorable items in the other income line that resulted in unfavorable comparisons. But in terms of that specifically, I would say that we did a good job, in the quarter, continuing the cost savings you have seen so far this year, and we have been offsetting inflation. And as far as A&C goes, in general, it is in line with last year, so no major changes. But we have unlocked some more investments, specifically in the quarter in a couple of places where we see good momentum, and there will be more to come in Q4. So it was not -- A&C in total in the quarter, it was not overhead cost, it was the -- some unfavorability this quarter in other income lapping favorability last year as we had asset sales and a little bit of insurance claims that were refunded. Bryan Spillane : Okay. And then, I guess, as a follow-up to that, Dirk, it's early -- I guess, you're beginning to make early progress against your strategic plan. And I guess, as that's unfolding, could you just sort of give us an idea of how you're thinking about spending levels for 2019 and how should -- we should think about that as we're looking at our models and looking at the opportunities going into next year? Dirk Van de Put : Yes, yes, Bryan. Well, first of all, maybe a little bit on the strategy in general. We had a number of premises in our strategy as we announced it in September. The first one was that snacking is a great place to be in food these days, and the quarter confirmed that with the 2.7% growth of our categories worldwide, even if we had a the significant heat wave in Europe which obviously impacts chocolate sales. And then the other premise was that emerging markets will continue to drive growth, and they were particularly strong in this quarter with 6% growth. So we feel good about those 2 premises, they were confirmed. And then as it relates to the other 3 strategies that we laid out : accelerated consumer-centric growth; we continue with our new marketing playbook; we did a number of innovations that were launched, I talked about a few; and we keep on being focused on M&A, operational excellence. We talked about gross margin. Also, the new organization we're putting in place, the recyclable packaging. And then as it relates to the culture, again, that new organization which pushes accountability closer and the new incentive plan that will reward profit dollars and volume growth. So we're on track, we're making progress on all these 3 strategies and can go deeper into detail if you would like to. But overall, what we're expecting for the spending next year, and we're still, of course, finalizing the plans, but we expect those to be the 4 big areas. The first one would be, of course, A&C the second one, in overall capabilities of the company; the third one, in quality; and the fourth one, in route to market. The specific levels are probably a little bit early to comment on, but we're expecting those 4 areas to see a significant increase next year. Bryan Spillane : But fair to say that's still concorporated in the guidance that you gave us for '19 back in September. Dirk Van de Put : Yes, yes, yes. No change there. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Kenneth Goldman : I'd like to ask 1 quick one and then a broader one, if I can. For the fourth quarter -- or for the second half, I think you said that you expect your operating margin on a pro forma basis to be roughly the same as in the first half of the year. I think that implies maybe an operating margin in the fourth quarter lower than the annual average, maybe something like 16.3, 16.4 on a percent basis. Can you confirm that I'm doing my math there, very quickly? I just want to make sure because -- as we think about the modeling. Luca Zaramella : Look, I think, and as you think about our margin year-to-date, OI margin is around about 16.8%. I think as we guided the full year to approximately 17%, I would say Q4 is around about in line with the year-to-date number. Kenneth Goldman : Okay. And then I'm following up on that. My broader question is I just wanted to ask about pricing in the U.S. I think the number you had, over 1%, was the best in a few years this quarter, and the comparison was relatively difficult. So can you just help us how to understand a little bit about the balance between list pricing? How much is list pricing driving the success versus lower promotions? I really just want to get a better idea of how sustainable this pricing is because it's obviously a very sensitive topic for many, many CPG companies in the U.S. today. Luca Zaramella : Look, I think we have work to do in the U.S., quite honestly. But I think pricing and the right balance between volume and pricing is something that we feel quite good about. If you look at the U.S. market and what we have done in biscuit not only this quarter but over the last few quarters, I think you'll see, in consumption terms, a nice balance in biscuit between volume and pricing. So going back to your specific question, we implemented pricing earlier in the year, which was a line pricing increase on some of our local brands, and that is coming in effect now. We have optimized promo spending. And again, I think we found the sweet spot in some of our brands where, I think, there were some inefficient promotions in place. And as I said, we are pleased seeing volume and pricing growth in the marketplace in consumption terms. And we introduced some price pack architecture. So we really used a full array of tools to implement pricing in the U.S. In addition, as we said, we have announced additional pricing across biscuits, gum and candy. And that pricing will be effective as of Q1 next year, and it will be for the vast majority line pricing. I think based on what we see these days, quite happy with the share gains and the balance, as I said. So we have confidence in the fact that this is the right move. And I think, as you look at the sustainability of the category and the ability we have to invest, I think, clearly, given the inflationary pressure we see in some commodities and logistics costs, this is the right thing to do. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Just two quick ones for me. I'd say, first, to reach 2% organic top line for the full year, I suggest around 1% organic top line in the fourth quarter. Obviously, slower than the 2.3% rate year-to-date and even down sequentially from the third quarter of 1.8%, if you exclude the malware impact. So I guess I'm just trying to get a sense, is there something specific that you see is slowing the organic down in 4Q or really just sort of thinking conservatively at this point? Luca Zaramella : Look, we are clearly encouraged by the top line evolution. And we see clearly momentum, specifically across emerging markets. We are happy with the volume and pricing balance. Categories, as we said, are quite vibrant, specifically in emerging markets. And you said that I think we want to be thoughtful about the fourth quarter. As you know, that's -- in the U.S., there might still be some challenges even if we see improvements clearly in Q4 and in October, specifically. So I think it is just us wanting to be thoughtful about the fourth quarter, and I think we see light to the 2% even in Q4, quite honestly, around about 2%. Andrew Lazar : Got it. And then I guess, when you think about the 2% to 3% organic top line growth forecast for 2019, I guess, what is the, at least currently, your category growth expectation that's sort of built into that number? And really what I'm trying to get at is how much in the way of share gains are really needed at this stage, your best guess, to hit that 2% to 3% for next year? Dirk Van de Put : Well, we see the category, so we see them at the moment growing at 2.7%. In our strat plan, we had foreseen that they would be around 3%. Us aiming at 2.5% for next year means that we do not see any market share gain for next year. We are largely aiming to stay in line with the market. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Alexia Howard : Can we ask about the product strategy here in the U.S. I've been looking at the Nielsen data, and it seems as though the big launch of the chocolate product a couple of years ago seems to be being undone. Gum seems to be getting a little bit better sequentially. I don't know whether you're putting more investment in there as you also try to migrate one of those brands into the mint segment. Obviously, you've still got the cookie strategy going strongly. I think there may have been some innovations that didn't quite work in crackers. Could you just give us a sort of quick summary of what you're actually focusing on and what the strategy is, product category by product category, here? Dirk Van de Put : Yes. So maybe I'll start with chocolate. Yes, we entered the U.S. chocolate market, which is highly competitive. And we know that it will take some time, but we're trying to leverage the power of the Oreo brand there. I think it's a good example of extending our brands to play in adjacent categories but, obviously, it's going to be a niche type of play. And we see very positive indicators as it relates to Oreo chocolates, a very strong consumer response with the highest repeat rate of any recent innovation in the category. So overall, we think we feel pretty good about it. We just are going through the second year after the launch, and I think it's normal to see a little bit of a decline there. As it relates to gum, yes, the gum market itself has been doing better. We are seeing a very nice category growth coming back in the U.S. And you see a little bit of a better performance from us driven also by a new innovation called Trident Vibes that -- which we have also launched in China under the Stride brand. And we're seeing good results there with an early share taking of 1.2 points. And then, as it relates to cookies, I would say the crackers are relatively flat as we see our shares. But in the rest of the cookie segment, we are seeing quite interesting growth. Oreo is around the mid-single digits. belVita is up quite nicely. Ritz is doing well. So as you saw there, Alexia, we're doing quite well in our cookies approach. But overall, I would say there's some wins and some losses there. But overall, we feel pretty good about how things are going. You didn't mention candy, but Sour Patch Kids is doing quite well in the candy segment. So it's -- yes, there are some ins and outs. But overall, I think, if you look at all the categories, we're increasing our market share. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Christopher Growe : Just had a question for you, if I could. I wanted to ask around the chocolate category where you have seen cocoa cost come down. Are you seeing more competition emerge in that category? I thought you were holding or gaining share, only 40% of the category, yet the sales are strong in the category and for your business as well. So I'm just curious how the competitive dynamic is shaping up in that category. Dirk Van de Put : Yes, the category growth is strong. It's about 3.6%. Our revenue growth was 3.5%, so quite close. Yes, we, at 40%, are holding or gaining share. That is largely due to, I would say, the -- some areas, Australia, New Zealand. We lost some share in France, Sweden. But overall, if I look at the performance, I don't think it's particularly something that we are concerned about. We're seeing big competition showing up. For instance, in chocolates, the overall growth is still quite strong, in mid-single digits overall, but the emerging markets are growing high single digits. And the developed markets maybe took back a little bit in the third quarter. But overall, I think we feel pretty strong about our chocolate performance. Christopher Growe : Okay, no areas of price competition emerging as costs get a little more favorable there, certainly in cocoa. Dirk Van de Put : No. Luca Zaramella : No, I don't think there is really anything to worry about. We are lapping a quite high share number last year in Q3. We gained quite a bit of share across the board. So I think, think about that as phasing. It will come back. Christopher Growe : Okay. And I just had a quick question to follow up on North America. And before, we have seen the prior year, obviously, the comp issues. But we have seen of late the consumption data weaken a little bit and yet still very strong in cookies, I would say. Can you just react to that and give a little bit of a feel for how that should shape up in the fourth quarter, given some of the lingering issues you've had in that division? Dirk Van de Put : Yes, the lap for cookies versus last year, there was a big buildup for the hurricane last year. So yes, the overall category growth was a little bit slower, but we attribute that largely to a very tough comparison for last year. Year-to-date, we see the category at 1.9%, with our share being up 0.7%. In the last quarter, our share grew a full point. We expect the category to be coming back to higher levels as we don't have that lap effect anymore. So we have no particular indication that the category would be slowing down. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Strycula with UBS. Steven Strycula : A two part question. I wanted to ask about Latin America and 3 of your bigger businesses there with Brazil, Mexico and Argentina. Given the inflation that we're seeing in some of those markets and volatility around elections, can you talk about how you're managing each of those businesses from both a pricing and a volume strategy and comment on how some of the key competition, whether -- particularly local competition, if it's following? That would be very helpful. Dirk Van de Put : Yes, maybe I'll comment a little bit and then hand it over to Luca specifically on pricing. Overall, in Latin America, we see -- we continue to see very positive organic growth, and I think we're managing well through the emerging market volatility. The revenue growth in Q3 was driven largely by Argentina and Mexico, and Brazil declined. I'll leave it up to Luca to comment a little bit on Argentina and the situation there. Mexico, we are very positive. We had a very solid performance, mid-single-digit, and gum and candy continued to be very strong. And then in Brazil, yes, we had a decline, which was in line with expectations. But the good thing there is that we are addressing some of the chocolate price gaps that we've had in the beginning of the year, and that is helping us to regain some market share in chocolate. So we feel pretty good about that. Overall, I would say, as it relates to management, Mexico, we don't see a particular need. Argentina, seeing the high inflation, yes, we need to be very vigilant. And then -- and again, Luca will comment on that. But Brazil, we feel pretty optimistic about next year in Brazil. We see indications that things will improve, and we are counting on a positive sales growth in Brazil for next year. Luca? Luca Zaramella : So specifically in Argentina, it is around about 2% of our revenue. And given the high inflationary environment, we are managing it, quite frankly, a little bit differently than the other 2 countries that Dirk mentioned, Brazil and Mexico. It is a disciplined approach, the one we are taking, to protecting cash flow and value. In fact, in the quarter and consistently throughout the year, we did double-digit pricing that drove revenue. We're happy with the way we are protecting cash flow and value in that country. In fact, I can tell you that our margin in the quarter was in line with last year. So it is a fine line between understanding how to price, protecting cash flow and also with the look of not losing too much scale in the country as it is tough to see it, but I think, potentially one day, that is a country with a sound economy that could grow and be a good business for us. So it is a fine balance, but it is a different way of managing it as we have compared to other countries in Latin America. Steven Strycula : I have a quick follow-up, if I can. Wanted to ask about the different moving pieces with the coffee business, how you've recasted the financials there. What should we be using as the 2017 baseline for all the coffee equity income from last year? And then, ultimately, not specific guidance, but how would you generically guide it for the full year 2018, again, given the change in reporting that you guys put out there? Luca Zaramella : No, it is a tricky question to guide you on coffee because, clearly, KDP is a publicly traded company. And that is one of the reasons we decided to go on a lag. There was an 8-K earlier in the month, where you can find the detail by quarter. But simply said, the impact of moving us to a lag, it is not going to be material in the year. So I can give you more details, maybe separately, and take you through some of the highlights of the 8-K, but think about consistency with what we said before in the context of double-digit EPS and the synergies that KDP is going to deliver. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Robert Moskow : Dirk, I think you mentioned new pricing that's going into effect in first quarter across multiple categories. Can you remind us what markets those price increases are going into effect? And if it's in the U.S., what was the pitch to the trade for raising price? Is it to offset commodities or freight? And did you make any kind of product quality improvements to help justify the increase? Dirk Van de Put : Yes, well, I will first comment on North America. As we explained before, we did -- in the middle of the year, we did an increased spread between a line price increase, price pack architecture and a promotional optimization on the local brands that we have. And then we are doing a price increase across the line at the beginning of next year. The -- we will do more of the same as it relates to those 3 mechanisms of increasing prices, but it's a bit more line price increase at the beginning of the year. We believe that it's the right move for us, seeing the overall environment and the way our categories are behaving at the moment. It will allow us to make the right investments in our brands and in our categories. So at this stage, we think that is probably the best way to do it. Of course, there are cost pressures also related to this as it relates to freight and some commodities, the trade is well aware of that. So they understand that, that is some of the reasons why we are doing those price increases. Around the world, I would say it's a little bit the same story, although less pronounced. We're doing some price increases in other countries, but it is not of the magnitude that we have to do in North America. Luca? Robert Moskow : Okay. In chocolate -- go ahead. Dirk Van de Put : Sorry. Excuse me? Robert Moskow : I wanted to follow up on chocolate in Europe, whether that is included in the price increases in the first quarter or no pricing? Luca Zaramella : Look, we cannot comment on specific pricing actions. As we said about pricing, the vast majority of pricing, it is coming in effect in emerging markets, excluding Argentina. We are pleased with what we see there. I think, if you look and extract Argentina from the number of emerging markets, you see a growth that is 4.5%. It is underpinned by pricing, but there is also a nice component of volume. So think about pricing being in effect in emerging markets pretty much on the vast majority of those markets. And we are watching closely volume dynamics because we don't want to lose momentum, and we want to preserve that operating leverage that is the foundation of the plan we presented at the Investor Day. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi. David Driscoll : One quick clarification. I think you said that the first half operating margin, which I think was 16.7%, and the second half operating margin will be same as first half, but then the full year guidance is like 17%. Can you just clear that up for me just for -- and I hate to be so particular on basis points, but it almost sounds like the 2 pieces of the guidance would mathematically come out with a number below 17%. And maybe that is the right answer. But can you just clear that up right now? Luca Zaramella : Yes. So as I said, on a year-to-date basis, the margin is 16.8%. I think it was around about 16.7% in the first half. As we guided to approximately 17%, see Q4 pretty much in line with both the first half and the Q3 year-to-date number. So it will be approximately 17%, a little bit below and in line with the full year guidance we gave. David Driscoll : Okay, that's fine. And then on the U.S. pricing that you have going into January 1, what was the size of the price announcements that you made implementing on January 1? Luca Zaramella : We are not getting into specific details. But as we said, it would be across the 3 categories : biscuit, gum and candies. And it will be different by brand. And we have looked into potential elasticity impacts, and we are trying to strike the right balance between preserving the volume and pricing momentum that we see in the marketplace these days and preserving margins going forward. David Driscoll : A final one for me is, volume was positive on the year-to-date basis but negative in the third quarter. When you move into the fourth quarter, does volume turn positive again, leading us into 2019 with the expectation of positive volumes? Luca Zaramella : Look, this quarter comps are clearly affected by the malware additional shipments last year. But I can assure you that the underlying dynamics are pretty much unchanged versus the previous quarters. I think you should look at the year-to-date volume and pricing balance. And as you look at that, I think what you see is that growth is half attributable to volume and the other half is pricing. Think about those dynamics continuing in Q4, but don't look at Q3 and draw the conclusion that volume was soft because we are lapping malware last year. And I think, again, as you look at the dynamics of emerging markets, Europe and Latin America, it is, quite frankly, in line with what we have seen so far this year. Dirk Van de Put : And then I would like to add that for 2019, we have studied the elasticity of our price increases quite carefully, so we don't provide any specific guidance on split between volume mix and pricing. But we are working towards that goal of a volume-led growth over the long term, and we feel that the current dynamic we're seeing of the positive volume mix year-to-date that we can continue that into next year. Operator : And our last question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Deutsche Bank. Robert Dickerson : So I guess, just to, I guess, beat the horse till he's dead, excuse my phrase. Just in terms of 2019 and, as we have stressed, the price increase across the categories, the expectation would that there would still be a balance between the pricing and the volume? Or are we thinking even though the goal, obviously, the target is to have volume-driven top line longer term, that maybe in '19, it's a little bit more tilted to pricing upfront? Is that fair? That's my first question. Dirk Van de Put : Yes. And just that it's -- we're counting on the same good balance between volume mix and pricing to continue into next year. We will see how the things play out. But at the moment, we are planning for something similar to this year. As we said, we have means of playing around with promotional spending, and that allows us to play around with how much we will get from volume. So I wouldn't expect that it's going to be a huge change for next year. At this stage, we feel pretty confident that the current formula, and it's working for us, that we can extend it into 2019. Robert Dickerson : Okay, fair. And then just housekeeping items, and that's all I have, is, from the Investor Day, I believe you had said the expectation was, essentially into next year, favorable trends in terms of GDP improvements, which would drive, let's call it, that 3% category growth. It seems like snacking may be -- all-in may be driven more by biscuits, and Q3 came in a bit. It sounds like the category growth is a bit below what the strat plan showed, as you said. So I guess the first question is, is there anything that really kind of changed in terms of biscuit growth trajectory into '19? And is that partially driven off of different GDP expectations? And then just secondly and simplistically, it looked like the currency effect for next year that you had mentioned at your Investor Day was the same that you put out today. But it did seem like the currency complex changed a bit over the past two months. So I'm just curious if there were any go-forward currency shifts relative to two months ago for '19. That's it. Luca Zaramella : Yes, let me start maybe with the forex impact. The forex impact is the same as we had for Investor Day, but it happened to be a coincidence. There were various puts and takes. And I can tell you that, in general, with the profit component of emerging markets, EPS was improved. But we had the eurozone that lost a bit. So it happens to be the same. It was refreshed as of last week. So the number is the same, but it is a coincidence. In terms of categories, look, I think the guidance we gave you in terms of top line for next year, which is 2% to 2.3%, calls for a category dynamic that is in line with what we have seen this year and in line, certainly, with the 2.7% on a year-to-date basis. There might be puts and takes, but that is where we see the category, the snacking category, playing out for us this year and next year. Dirk Van de Put : Okay. So in closing, I'm proud of the work of our teams across the business and the results that we are currently seeing. We are very encouraged by the progress in our emerging markets, which were particularly strong this quarter, and of course, where we see the significant amount of our future growth to be derived. Europe remains a solid business for us. And there is work to do in North America, but I'm also confident in the opportunity for that business to start growing. I would say that our new long-term strategy is generating excitement in our business. We are building from a position of leadership in our markets, and we are taking steps to further strengthen our capabilities and capture opportunity, as we explained. I'm here thinking particularly of the change in our commercial model, which is more consumer-focused and will drive greater local accountability. I'm also excited about the test, learn and scale approach that we are taking in innovation and then our increased focus on M&A, and that is a good example of what is more to come. And we also mentioned that we are planting the seeds for future growth with the launch of our new SnackFutures platform, of which we will inform you more in the coming weeks. And there is -- overall, incentive structure is changing. So we feel good about this quarter and then good about the coming quarters and next year. So I look forward to sharing more of our progress with you in the quarters to come, and thank you for your interest in the company. Operator : This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

Today\u2019s call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Mondelez management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President, Investor Relations from Mondelez. Please go ahead, sir. Shep Dunlap : Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO and Luca Zaramella, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website mondelezinternational.com/investors. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today\u2019s prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we will be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures unless otherwise noted. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation. In today\u2019s call, Dirk will give you an overview of our results as well as progress against our strategic priorities then Luca will take you through the financials and our 2019 outlook. We will close with Q&A. And with that, I will now turn the call over to Dirk. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you, Shep and good afternoon. Last September at our Investor Day, I shared with you our long-term strategy to refocus the company on sustainable top line growth, which we saw as a natural evolution from our more cost and margin-oriented strategy over the last 5 years. This new strategy leverages our unique difference from other food companies, which is our strong global presence, our iconic brands and our leaner supply model. But above all, what really sets us apart in today\u2019s difficult food environment is our unique position as a global snacking leader. Because we are in snacking, we are not in general food, we are also all over the world, not just in North America and we have global and local brands that have unique place in consumer\u2019s mind. As such, we are a truly global company, operating in attractive, large and growing markets. And in those markets we have a strong manufacturing distribution and marketing network. This means, for instance, that our scale and strong presence in emerging markets is an asset and a competitive advantage. As an example, in the fourth quarter, our emerging markets grew at 6.5% and around 6% for the full year. More than 40% of this was volume mix driven indicating that consumers around the world consume more on-the-go snacks and treats. We connect with consumers in those markets through a portfolio of powerful global brands as well as local items. And in each market we also strive to be the industry leader in understanding consumers to advance insights and analytical capabilities. During the last 5 years, we have gone through a significant restructuring and a cost focused approach, which has created a solid foundation for investment. These strengths of our company are amplified through our unique group of people who have an incredible capability to really make a difference when they put their minds to it. Witness to that has been our margin improvement over the last 5 years. 2018 was my first full year as CEO. I joined in November 2017 and today, I feel good about what we have achieved in that short-term. In the first half of 2018, we developed a new strategy that we think will make a difference. In the second half, we started to execute against that strategy and that has translated into good results and momentum going into 2019. So, we are pretty excited about our future. This new strategy creates more growth by focusing on three pillars. First, is a new more consumer-centric marketing and sales; second, an obsession with operational excellence to optimize our demand fulfillment, but also to drive efficiency and lower our costs; and third, there is a step change in our corporate culture from short-term cost focus to a purpose-driven long-term growth focus. The combination of these three levels of growth creation will lead to what is an attractive long-term financial algorithm, 3% plus organic net revenue growth, high single-digit adjusted EPS growth, dividend growth that exceeds adjusted EPS growth and over $3 billion of yearly free cash flow. Now, in switching to the highlights of the year, I would characterize 2018 as a strong year for Mondelez. We met or exceeded our financial and strategic commitments. We accelerated our top line growth with a good balance between volume mix and price. Our execution in emerging markets drove 6% growth. Our local brands are showing improvements as we balance investment with our global brands. We expanded adjusted gross profit dollars in Q4 by approximately 5% on a constant currency basis. This was due to solid productivity, volume leverage and a good balance of pricing net of costs. We also delivered another year of double-digit adjusted EPS growth, which brings our 5-year average to 18% per year. Our focus on turning profit into cash flow and returning capital to shareholders also paid off. 2018 was a year of strong free cash flow, generating $2.9 billion of cash and returning more than $3 billion to investors. We continued our commitment to our impact strategy and announced all our packaging will be recyclable by 2025. I believe this strong 2018 financial performance is just a first indication of what is the potential of this company. Now, maybe a few words on our progress against that new strategy I was talking about before. As 2018 came to a strong close, I am pleased to see that many of the elements of our new approach are being put in place. So, let me take you may be through a few highlights. 2019 will be the first full year of increased investment in our growth agenda. But as we saw good momentum as Q4 progressed, we made additional investments in A&C and go-to-market. To give you a few examples, we put incremental A&C behind areas like chocolate in India, which grew double-digits, biscuits in China, where we saw mid single-digit growth, chocolate and biscuits in Russia, which increased double-digit for the year, biscuits and chocolates in Germany with low single-digit overall country growth for the year, or chocolates in the UK, which posted low single-digit growth. Oreo in the U.S. which posted high single-digit increase for the year or we invested in our recent Mexico Oreo chocolate launch which has received very positive feedback from our customers. We have also further invested in our research, development and quality capabilities. In Q4, we opened a new R&D technical center in India to drive innovation in chocolate and beverages. And we also expanded our state-of-the-art facility in Wroclaw, Poland with further investment in gum and candy research capabilities. The creation of the SnackFutures innovation hub will help us explore future trends and opportunities. We are also pleased with our recent acquisition of the Tate\u2019s Premium Cookies business, which delivered another quarter of strong double-digit growth. As a second big step in accelerating our consumer-centric growth, we launched our new marketing playbook, which drives shifts in several areas of our commercial approach. While in the past we focused mostly on our global brands in our new strategy we are achieving a better balance between investment in global brands like Oreo, Milka and belVita and local jewels like Fontaneda in Spain or LU in France; Freia, Marabou in the Nordics; Kinh Do in Vietnam. The combination of those two is generating stronger growth than focus on global brands alone. All combined, our brands drove overall organic net revenue growth of 2.5% for the quarter. In our second strategic pillar, which is all about driving operational excellence, we also started to show good progress, particularly as it relates to excellence in our sales channels. To give you some recent examples, we have launched initiatives to drive e-commerce excellence with key partners in China, where online sales were up strong double-digits and overall growth in China was mid single-digits. In India, we are making significant enhancements to our sales and route to market excellence, where we also grew double-digits. We are making similar shifts to tap into the significant opportunities in other emerging markets such as Africa, Southeast Asia, Russia and Mexico where our investments are accelerating growth. As you know, in recent quarters we have put particular focus on our North American supply chain performance, where we are aiming to significantly improve its operational excellence. Q4 was a good quarter where our gradual improvement continued in the right direction. An important enabler of our future growth is our third pillar of building a winning growth culture. At the start of 2019, we implemented a new more locally oriented commercial structure with 13 business units within our existing regional framework. This shift reduces our complexity, improves our speed and encourages more entrepreneurial approaches to marketing, sales and product development. We are encouraging our colleagues to test, learn and scale, which means we are implementing a faster, more cost effective and locally driven approach to innovation. We are also changing our incentive structure to drive better overall alignment with our key financial metrics of volume and revenue growth, gross profit progression and solid translation into earnings and cash flow. There is also a stronger direct link to local performance versus overall global performance. And another important change here is that we are refocusing the organization on volume and absolute profit dollar growth. We are also making sure that the quality of the financial results is taken into account into our incentives. To further enhance this new consumer-oriented but also performance-based culture, we launched the new purpose of the company, empower people to snack right. We believe this will lead to higher engagement as well as new ideas on how we will fulfill our vision of being the best and biggest snacking company. One of the expressions of our new purpose is to make sure we offer the consumer the right snack made the right way. For example, in this quarter, we added Brazil to the Cocoa Life program, which is our signature sustainability approach in chocolates. And we also announced the commitment to make all our packaging around the world recyclable by 2025. So in summary, I find that 2018 was the strong year for us, which has created good momentum in the business as we head into 2019. We are building on this momentum by increasing our investment behind key initiatives. This includes continuing to invest in our brands and portfolio to capture opportunities in broader snacking as well as driving further growth through innovation. We are also focusing our investment in higher growth geographies and under-indexed channels. We will amplify this growth by continuing to work on improving execution across our business. And I am also very excited by the energy that our new growth-focused culture is creating across the organization. Our tangible progress and the proof points I see around the world of how we are accelerating sustainable growth, underscore my belief and confidence that we are in the right segment with the right footprint and the right portfolio. Snacking is an attractive and growing global trend and we are well-positioned to continue to lead the industry. Let me now turn to Luca for more detail on our Q4 and full year performance. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Dirk and good afternoon. It was a good quarter and a good year as we delivered on all our key financial metrics for both periods, especially as it relates to organic top line growth, earnings growth and free cash flow generation. We are also pleased with the quality of the delivery throughout the year. We had generated broad-based growth with a good balance of volume and pricing. Gross profit on a constant currency basis grew more than revenue in both Q4 and the full year. In Q4, we also started accelerating some investments to further support our brands. So, we feel good about the momentum we had coming into 2019 as our teams executed well and made progress towards our strategic roadmap. Net revenue increased 2.4% for the full year and 2.5% for the fourth quarter. Our strong emerging market footprint propelled our growth for the year delivering an increase of nearly 6% with clear trends in Russia, India, China, Southeast Asia, Mexico and Africa. In fact, Brazil was the only notable emerging market where results were soft. Excluding Argentina, emerging markets grew 4.5%. On a regional basis and for the full year, Europe continues to execute well as it delivered net revenue growth of 2.5%. Consistent with recent years, this growth was volume-driven and broad-based with solid increases across biscuits, chocolate and candy. Russia posted double-digit revenue growth behind share gains in both biscuits and chocolates, while Germany delivered another solid year of growth. Our chocobakery business continues to demonstrate the power of test and learn innovation and excellent execution turning in high single-digit growth for the year and approaching $600 million in annual sales. We are pleased with our capabilities in this region and encouraged regarding the opportunity that remain in front of us. AMEA grew 3.5% and is accelerating with strength coming from several key markets. India delivered double-digit growth powered by great execution, robust market dynamics, share gains and innovation in chocolate and biscuit. China posted its sixth consecutive quarter of growth, increasing mid single-digits behind continued momentum and share gains in biscuits and gum. Southeast Asia also turned in robust growth propelled by demand for biscuit and chocolate, including a strong mooncake season in Q4. We are also pleased with the progress we are making in Africa. Latin America grew 3.6%, impacted by inflation-driven growth in Argentina. However, we delivered another good year in Mexico, posting mid single-digit growth as our gum and candy business executed well. We also delivered growth in the Western Andean cluster. Brazil declined low single-digits primarily due to competitive dynamics in our powdered beverage business. Earlier in the year, the business was also impacted by a national strike. However, we delivered positive results in our Brazilian biscuits business, which grew mid single-digits behind strengths in Club Social and Oreo and although down for the year the chocolate business finished on a positive note, with low-single digit growth in Q4 and share gains. North America grew approximately 0.5% for the year. U.S. biscuits continued to see good momentum with low single-digit growth and share gains driven by brands like Oreo. We are proud that the team delivered material progress for the quarter. That said there is still work to be done to drive improved levels of consistency and we continue to expect progress in 2019 albeit not linear. Now, let\u2019s review our profit performance. In 2018, gross profit dollars grew by approximately 4% on a constant currency basis and ahead of revenue. Gains were driven by continued productivity, volume leverage and pricing. We look to build on this progress over the long-term. Gross profit growth partially offset by additional investment drove adjusted operating income dollar expansion of more than 6% on a constant currency basis. This translated into operating income margin of 16.7%, up 60 basis points. In Q4, consistent with our long-term strategy, we invested additional dollars in growth initiatives, including point of sales and holiday season activations in Europe and Asia, A&C investments in Europe and Mexico chocolate and investments in China and Russia biscuit to sustain and accelerate momentum. Additionally, we spent in some R&D and marketing areas. On a regional basis, gross margin expansion and cost execution drove margin improvement. Europe grew 60 basis points to 19.6%. North America was flat at 20.3% as higher conversion costs in U.S. factories and customer service and logistics cost limited expansion. Latin America increased by 90 basis points to 16.4% and AMEA improved by 140 basis points to 14.4%. I will now briefly cover category highlights. Our three snacking categories continue to demonstrate solid growth as they have all year growing at 2.7%. This is the strongest they have been in 3 years and we remain encouraged by the underlying trends and untapped opportunities. Overall, we held or gained share in 60% of our business. Year-to-date, biscuits grew 2.8%. Approximately, 80% of our revenue grew or held share in this category, including our U.S., France, China, Germany and Russia businesses. In chocolate, our business grew 3.5%. Approximately, 40% of our revenue grew or held share, including Germany, Russia, China and India. The percent of businesses growing or holding shares was 50% in Q4 and it is further improving in the latest period. Gum and candy growth was slightly positive, reflecting modestly improved results in developed markets. About 40% of our revenue in this business gained or held share, including strength in China gum and solid U.S. candy performance. Now, turning to earnings per share, as is mentioned, 2018 was another year of strong adjusted EPS growth, increasing 15% on a constant currency basis. These results were driven primarily by strong operating gains, share repurchases, taxes, with our JV investments also performing well. I will now move on to our free cash flow results. For the year, we executed with excellence and delivered $2.9 billion of free cash flow, which was consistent with our outlook and a great outcome despite currency headwinds. This performance was driven by better net income conversion due to strong working capital management. As I mentioned at our Investor Day, this is a critical focus area for me, my team and the entire company. Turning to capital return, 2018 also marked another year of significant return of capital to our shareholders. We returned $3.4 billion in total as we repurchased $2 billion in stock and paid $1.4 billion in dividends. This includes an 18% increase to our cash dividends in Q3 as we continue to target dividend growth in excess of earnings. Now, let me provide some details around our outlook for 2019, which remains consistent with what we provided at our Investor Day last fall. I would like to remind you that this is an important year of investment as we continue to focus on accelerating volume-driven revenue growth for the long-term. For the top line, we expect organic net revenue growth of 2% to 3%. With respect to earnings, we expect adjusted earnings per share growth of 3% to 5%, which reflects a step up in investment levels in A&C, sales, R&D and quality. These investments will reinforce a growth cycle, which we expect to lead to a high single-digit earnings growth over the long-term. Our outlook for the free cash flow is approximately $2.8 billion consistent with our results in 2018. Recall, this outlook includes additional cash tax impact resulting from U.S. tax reform. In this outlook, we also expect our 2019 adjusted effective tax rate to be in the low 20s and expect interest expense to be approximately $450 million, reflecting the increasing rate environment. 2019 is an important year for Mondelez International. It will mark the first full year of our new approach to investing behind our strategic growth initiatives. Our new approach will set the stage for our long-term growth algorithm of 3% plus organic net revenue growth with a ramp up in the outer years. High single-digit adjusted EPS, dividends greater than adjusted earnings and free cash flow of more than $3 billion. With that, let\u2019s open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Good afternoon, everybody. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, Andrew. Luca Zaramella : Hi, Andrew. Andrew Lazar : Hi, two questions from me if I could. I will start with, Dirk, you have been in the CEO seat for just over a year now and recently detailed the company\u2019s strategy and growth algorithm along with a new organizational structure to support it. I am trying to get a sense of how you are feeling about the company\u2019s momentum heading into this year? And I ask with particular interest in terms of organic sales trends because you have got incremental pricing that you have announced, incremental investments that we saw in both 4Q and then expect it again throughout this year. I guess if anything it would seem like the organic sales growth target for this year perhaps could end up as a bit conservative. And I wanted to get your perspective on that? And then I have a quick follow-up. Dirk Van de Put : Okay, okay. So well, I would say a few reflections on how I feel after about a year and 3 months in the job. Probably the most important for me was to deliver 2018 and I think we over delivered on what we said we would do. And the quality I think was good. If I think about it, we accelerated our net revenue growth, which was volume-driven and you said that, we also had some good price discipline. We continued to focus on our cost and so we had good gross profit growth and ROI and EPS growth was solid as well as the free cash flow generation. And on top, we were able to start reinvesting in Q4 to sustain the accelerated growth. So I feel good about all that. Second, as you pointed out, we developed our new strategy and financial algorithm for the company, which creates growth on the three levels where more demand creation to a new approach to sales and marketing, more demand fulfillment through better execution and then new ideas and innovation through a different mindset or a different culture in the company. There is a number of big shifts in the company. One is about the balance between top and bottom line, not just focused on the bottom line. Dollars over percentage focus, speed over perfection and a stronger focus on volume and market share and it\u2019s giving us momentum as you said. And so that confirms my observation that we have good potential, because snacking categories are doing well, they have been probably the best in the last 3 years in \u201818. We have got good margin expansion and we have good competitive levels that allow us to unlock investment and shift our focus to volume growth and we can generate substantial free cash flow. So yes, of course, that makes you think you are stronger than you were a few years back. Why are you guiding towards the 2%, 3% top line growth? And yes, we have momentum in emerging markets and if I think about 2018 and the mix of the pluses and the minuses that we had, overall, we probably had a few more pluses, as you remember, the main driver of it was that we are lapping the malware year of 2017 so 2019 is a year that we need to even if we guide toward that 2%, 3%, we need to step up our growth and we need to solidify our progress if I would look at today and reflect about 2019, probably the mix of risks and opportunities raise it a little bit more toward risk I\u2019m talking largely the macroeconomics, Brexit, some of the commodity things we are seeing and so, we also are stepping up and we are probably will point that out our investments we are doing it largely so that 2020 will be the year that we are starting to see some good growth so, we feel that 2019 outlook is appropriate but we are clearly entering the year with a bit of good momentum. Andrew Lazar : Great I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Chris Growe : Hi, good evening. Luca Zaramella : Hi, Chris. Chris Growe : Hi I had a question for you have had a pretty strong sustainable growth in your categories over the past few years and including in 2018 it seems like that category growth rates continue and I think it was up 2.7% for your snacking categories. Is that what you would expect for 2019 as well? Dirk Van de Put : Yes, yes, that\u2019s in our long-term strategic plan we estimated that we will be circling around the 3% growth, and we are at this stage, we will not see that 2.7% has been sort of consistent throughout 2018, what we were saying, and we are not seeing an immediate change for that and going into 2019 so yes, we reconfirm that. Chris Growe : Okay. And then as you look at your margin performance in 2019, I know there is a much more-heavier focus on reinvestment and accelerating revenue growth so you have cost savings coming through from simplified to grow and then I suspect you\u2019re going to have some more, is it mostly SG&A investments so could we see a stronger gross margin performance? And then maybe some of that given back, if you will, in the form of SG&A investments when it comes to A&C and route-to-market that kind of thing is that the way to think about the investment levels in 2019? Luca Zaramella : So, Chris, I think, look, as we said many times, we are trying to create a little bit of a cultural shift in the company and moving away from simple percentages the clear commitment we have is to drive gross profit growth and OI growth and EPS growth and as you think about that in the past by guiding to gross margin percentages and OI percentages, we left on the table we believe some opportunities we gave you in the past a couple of examples namely around channels and incrementality we see there, or for that matter, also local brands I think we have what it takes to generate incrementality there and to deliver good return on investment make no mistake when we say that we are focusing on dollar growth it doesn\u2019t mean that we will live outside productivity or the restructuring program that we announced in at the Investor Day the continuation of the current program, or for that matter, things that we have done quite well like ZBB and MBS over the last few years so, I think, as you think about the quality of the P&L in 2019, if you take out the additional investments we have, that are, as we said, in A&C but also in route-to-market or in quality or in R&D and marketing I think if you take those out, the shape and the quality of the P&L is very consistent with what we did in 2018. Chris Growe : Okay that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks for that color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, Bryan. Luca Zaramella : Hi, Bryan. Bryan Spillane : Just I guess, just two questions for me one, just in the fourth quarter the margins in North America were pretty good and, I guess, I just wanted to understand, since there it sounds like there were some reinvestment there was there anything else there that was sort of unusual or flowed through in North America, I guess, or was it just the pricing, the PNOC that helped? I\u2019m just trying to understand the margin performance in North America in the fourth quarter. Luca Zaramella : The margin was good as you say in North America I think as you think about it, we did make improvements in reliability of the supply chain and the logistics network and I think as we stabilize the situation a bit in terms of service levels, we were able to deliver efficiencies that in the other part of the year we were not I think you also saw that there was a little bit of a pricing favorability above and beyond the average of the year there were some phasing, quite frankly in there so I think as you think about pricing it was roundabout the number you have to keep in mind is the number that you see for the year, which was roundabout 1% but I think in stepping back and looking into it, quite pleased in North America with the continued momentum we\u2019ve seen in biscuit, still some challenges in categories like gum but in general, the margin that came through in Q4 was a good news for us and that\u2019s something to the team that did a nice job by stabilizing the situation in supply chain. Bryan Spillane : And then, I guess, as a follow-up to that as we\u2019re thinking about if service levels are improving in North America and hopefully continue to improve some in 2019 are you going to be able to how are you thinking about the balance between investing and spending in North America and then actually being able to service the programs? Do you feel like you\u2019ve you\u2019re maybe not spending as much or doing as much as you might ordinarily want to if you had full confidence in the ability to service it? Luca Zaramella : The outlook we have in place at the moment, it clearly has investments in North America now, having said that, there are still things that we need to look into, as we said in the last call, we implemented pricing and we are about see the effect in the marketplace so we need to stay flexible there and see how to best balance investments with pricing we also want to be clear that while we believe we are making good progress and we\u2019ve seen growth coming through, there is still work to be done in North America so in general terms I would say, we will invest more behind categories like biscuits or categories like candy, even in gum but the reality is we need to take an inventory of where we stand at the end of Q1 in terms of pricing and supply chain and then I think we need to adjust is the case. Bryan Spillane : Okay, great. I will leave it there. Thank you. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you. Luca Zaramella : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Ken Goldman : Hi thank you very much. Dirk Van de Put : Good morning, Ken. Luca Zaramella : Hi, Ken. Ken Goldman : Hi, guys. The primary pushback again on your stock is valuation and specifically on EBITDA and I think I talked to investors, many of them understand that the value of your joint ventures needs to be added back but plenty at least not at first glance seem to get that so, to me this issue is increasing, right? Investors are weighing EBITDA more heavily because debt levels have risen higher so, I guess, my question is this, if your thesis is correct that investors are sort of, I guess, punishing companies like Mondelez for relying on unconsolidated operations, does that you does that make you, I guess, internally rethink the value of your joint ventures to your stock price, or is that not really a way for you to factor that? Luca Zaramella : Look, I think we can clearly debate if we are overvalued or undervalued, I believe when I step back and I look at the opportunities we have as a company and the quality of the results that we delivered in 2018, I feel quite good about the long-term guidance that we gave and as a leading snacking company, ability to generate sustainably volume-driven growth of and resulting in revenue of 3%, high-single digit EPS and cash flow of $3 billion plus, I think it is something that is quite compelling my reply to your specific question is, look, the JVs clearly don\u2019t roll-up into our EBITDA they are around about 10% of our EPS I believe that clearly it was a great investment I believe there is still upside potential so I think they are still undervalued but the premise of Mondelez I think tangibly looking back at 2018 and handing us delivering in face of all the ForEx [indiscernible] that we had, a cash flow that was $2.9 billion with a conversion of net income that was excluding the JVs for which we don\u2019t get much dividend, 130%, I think that should reassure investors that we have what it takes to win and again, the premise of us being in emerging markets, seeing emerging markets growing 6% for the year, more than 6% for Q4, 40% of that growth being volume-driven. I mean, I can tell you we are quite pleased. And I think as you think about the valuation, think about what our potential is as a leading snacking company in emerging markets or for that matter, globally so that will be my reply. Ken Goldman : Okay thank you for that. And then a quick follow-up, at the end of your prepared remarks you reiterated your desire to grow dividends ahead of EPS growth can you elaborate on why this is the right decision? It feels to me, we just talked about, I think, investors are increasingly sensitive to debt your company that\u2019s also increasingly emphasizing growth and that requires reinvestment it just may be feels to me like raising your dividend above earnings isn\u2019t the ideal strategy but I\u2019m just curious to hear the rationale behind the take there. Luca Zaramella : I think it is the confidence we have in the overall capital structure of the company if you step back and if you think about the ability we have to generate free cash flow and our commitment that materialized in 2018 of $3 billion-plus from 2020 on, if you think about the balance sheet flexibility we have at our current leverage, but also with the fact that we were fairly clear, the coffee stake is an investment for us and it is not strategic that gives us flexibility so if you put the ability we have to generate cash, if you take into account the leverage that we have today, the coffee stake that we have, even in premise of M&A, I think we have what it takes to be able to have the flexibility to do share buybacks, to get dividend, and also to make M&A so I think you can update one piece you have to look at all of this together and all the elements are there pointing in the direction that there is confidence in being able to raise dividends the last time we did it, it was 18% so we feel good about that. Ken Goldman : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Alexia Howard : Good afternoon, everyone. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, Alexia. Alexia Howard : Hi. So just a quick question the emerging market growth ex-Argentina being in the 4% to 5%, two things a little lackluster I\u2019m just trying to understand how much of that was Brazilian gum and what\u2019s the prognosis there? It sounds as though Brazil was down low-single digits and some of the categories were positive, but gum business must have been in quite some trouble so maybe some commentary there and then just as a follow-up, some of the household products companies have complained local competition in places like China have slowed them down quite a bit what are you seeing out there in China relative to your local competitors? Do you think that\u2019s relevant to you and is that something that you\u2019re worried about in terms of getting the emerging markets growing again? Thank you and I\u2019ll pass it on. Dirk Van de Put : Okay. Well, on Brazil, yes, Brazil was, of the emerging markets, probably the one that didn\u2019t perform as we would have hoped in 2018 but we feel that over the medium-term, the growth prospects for Brazil are quite good it wasn\u2019t really because of gum that 2018 was more difficult for us it was really driven by two things there was a bit of a price scuffle, I would say, in the chocolate category, which we are getting through we see at the moment we see good volume growth in chocolate in Brazil we addressed the price gaps, and we started to gain share in the last quarter in biscuits, we were largely flat as it relates to share so it was really on top of the chocolate issue, it was the Powdered Beverages, which in Brazil we are seeing a colder summer so a slowdown in Q4 and we are expecting the same in Q1 of our Powdered Beverages sales and then on top, overall the Powdered Beverage category is doing a little bit less than cold drinks in general and then us within that category losing some market share so that was the real driver for Brazil as it relates to China, we obviously, like everybody else, have the local competition but we are pretty happy with our performance in China we had another solid quarter, which is the sixth consecutive quarter of growth for us in China all of our categories are growing. In gum, we are increasing our market share quite considerably because we launched a new product called Stride Waves, which is the same as the Trident Vibes here in the U.S. and then in chocolate, we launched our Milka Magic Cup and there also we have about 0.5 point of market share gains and then in biscuits, where we have the most local competition, we have been really doing well, with more than 1 point gain of our market share combined between online/offline we have got some pretty heavy growth going on in our e-commerce business in China, which is up almost 80% for the year so, overall, yes, there is a competition but at this stage, we feel like we are doing quite well in China. Alexia Howard : Great, thank you very much. I will pass it on. Dirk Van de Put : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow : Hi, two quick questions. You mentioned A&C investments in the quarter I don\u2019t know if I heard you quantify how much A&C was up year-over-year. Can you give us a sense of what it was in the quarter and then the year ago I am sorry for the overall year how much of it was up? And then secondly, pricing down a lot in Europe, my impression is that, especially in the UK that a lot of pricing needs to go higher to offset higher input costs and then, of course, the Brexit situation might make that accentuate that do you have a contingency plan if there is a hard Brexit this year? Thanks. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Robert. So, maybe Dirk will take the Brexit. I will start by commenting a bit on your A&C question and pricing as we said, we activated more investments in Q4, but we are not going to quantify by the way, it was A&C and as we saw good momentum in India chocolate, in China biscuits and gum, in Russia chocolate and biscuits, we gained in Russia alone more than 2 points of share in the last 12 months so as we saw these economies doing very well, as we saw volume-driven growth, I think we put more A&C and I think it was the right decision as we said, we are trying to invest in our local brands as well, but it was not only A&C I think if you look at what we did in Q4, for instance, we spent in seasonal activation in big countries like the UK, Germany and, for instance, in India, in Australia. But we also spent in route-to-market and finally we had investments in marketing and R&D I think if you think about the quantum, it was clearly materializing so the quality of the earnings, we had gross margin growing 90 basis points for the quarter, off of it dropped to the bottom line so we reinvested quite a bit going forward, we will reinvest even more the difference is going to be that it will involve more countries and more brands as to pricing, I wouldn\u2019t get quite frankly where it\u2019s fixated on the Q4 pricing impact for Europe there were some phasing in there what I can tell you is that, in general, the total pricing for the company was in the right place Europe specifically was able to generate nice gross profit growth, so gross margin was up in Europe again so it was puts and takes between pricing and commodities at ForEx that we had effectively covered for Europe I don\u2019t think there is much to worry at this point in time on pricing in Europe with the exception of may be Brexit that Dirk is going to talk about in a minute. Dirk Van de Put : So, as it relates to Brexit, yes, I mean, the UK is an important business for us and we have a very good team there that\u2019s very solid and I think they\u2019re very well-equipped to weather through this situation we don\u2019t know and that\u2019s the difficulty of Brexit we don\u2019t quite know what\u2019s going to happen here so we have to really prepare for the worst and hope for the best and the worst is clearly a hard Brexit we are assessing all the potential scenarios, and we do feel that Brexit will, for sure, have a short-term and a medium-term impact over the long-term, we believe that it will stabilize itself and we will come back to where we are today and, obviously, there\u2019s a huge difference between a hard Brexit and a softer Brexit so, as it relates to the hard Brexit, our contingency plan is quite extensive and it basically is focused on the disruption and the ease of the flow of the goods so we\u2019ve invested in additional resources in logistics operations that means, we\u2019ve rented many more trucks. We have rented much more warehousing space. We\u2019ve increased our inventories. We are making sure that we are capable even in difficult circumstances to maintain our customer service. And we are very focused on demand planning. And so, we\u2019ve also increased, for instance, our additional raw and packaging materials in the UK and in Europe. Now, Brexit, Brexit could come with other effects like devaluations or tariffs, may be a loss of consumer confidence in the first part. Those types of things we have not included in our current guidance. But we are preparing for it in case it would happen. I hope that yesterday\u2019s vote helps a little bit to avoid the hard Brexit. And then as it relates to pricing, I think we will have to see what happens particularly with Brexit itself to make decisions. At the moment, our pricing is adapted to the current situation, but we are ready to adapt the pricing as Brexit would start to happen. Robert Moskow : Okay. Thank you very much. Luca Zaramella : Okay. Dirk Van de Put : You are welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hi, good evening, folks. Luca Zaramella : Hi, Jason. Dirk Van de Put : Hi. Jason English : Thanks for sliding me in. I appreciate that you\u2019re focused on the holistic portfolio now and don\u2019t want to spend time dwelling on the legacy sort of Power Brands versus non-Power Brands. But I\u2019m going to try anyways, because the strategy clearly is one of trying to activate the periphery of the portfolio. And I love to get a bit more context of how it\u2019s working so far. So, is there any sort of performance metric you can give us and how these non-Power Brands are progressing as you extend the investment? Dirk Van de Put : Yes. We can explain that a little bit. So, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s the periphery of the portfolio. The \u2013 our non-Power Brands or our non-global brands are sometimes quite important. And we\u2019re really using them in synergy to try to cover as many aspects of the consumer needs that exist. And so, for instance, in Russia, we become leaders in chocolate by using the combination of Alpen Gold and Milka to be the winners in the market. So, it\u2019s more than the periphery. It\u2019s really playing off brands against each other and making sure that we activate all of those brands. So that is still, of course, a work-in-progress. But I would say that we have seen the Power Brands continuing largely on their trend of about 3% growth. And then we\u2019ve seen the local brands go down \u2013 go up, sorry, from a negative growth in the past two \u2013close to 1% growth in the last quarter. That sort of the shift we\u2019re seeing and obviously that\u2019s only after about 4 months of activation of those local brands. So, we\u2019re expecting to see more growth in 2019. Jason English : Excellent. Thank you for sharing that. And I want to come back to a comment you made in the prepared remarks about empowering people to snack right. I guess, snack right means lots of things to lots of people, but to me it seems to connote a degree of health and wellness, which is not something I think comes top of mind when we think about your portfolio. So, can you talk about the context around that statement in terms of your vision and whether or not it does entail a bigger push in health and wellness? And if so, how much of this would be sort of strategic M&A and priority versus organic? Dirk Van de Put : Yes. It means many things. It does have a health and wellness connotation. But if I take it up one step, it is a recognition that the same consumer depending on the moment of the day and the situation in which she finds \u2013 he or she finds himself can make different decisions. And when we say right, we mean that we want to offer the right product for the right occasion. And we see \u2013 as we look around at what\u2019s going on and what\u2019s growing in percentage it\u2019s the more health and wellness-oriented categories, but in dollars it\u2019s still the old biscuits, chocolate, ice cream and categories like that, that are getting the biggest growth. As it relates to health and wellness, yes, we clearly have an intent to do several things. It probably starts with constantly trying to improve the ingredients on our product, the sourcing of our raw materials, and may be that\u2019s not necessarily health-related, but we\u2019re thinking about Cocoa Life or our Harmony Wheat programs that we have, which are about more sustainability of the raw materials and so on. But I think that\u2019s also these days something that the consumer appreciates as we do that in our brands. We will also eliminate as much as we can fat and salt and things like that. And yes, we will need to have more pure health-oriented brands. We have several, belVita would be the one that comes most to mind, but we have clearly an intent apart from continuing to improve our current brands to launch more health-oriented options under our current brands or to launch new brands or \u2013 and you\u2019re right that might has to be partially also through M&A. But I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s more biased in one or another direction. It\u2019s a little bit of a whole spectrum of activity that we have in mind. Jason English : Got it. Thank you, guys. Dirk Van de Put : Okay. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Jason. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Strycula with UBS. Steven Strycula : Hi, good evening, and I hope everyone in Chicago staying warm. Dirk Van de Put : Yes, in the office, we are okay. Steven Strycula : But I think Shep was handing out handwarmers or something like that around the order of table. But \u2013 so my question is for Dirk to kick it off would be, how do I think about some of the more impactful investments in A&C and just in your broader route-to-market you\u2019re making this year. Specifically, Dirk, what are the key markets where sales force headcount for Mondelez employee is increasing, and then which emerging markets would local iconic brands matter most in your opinion? Then I have a short follow-up for Luca. Dirk Van de Put : Yes. Well, I would say, where the manpower matters is largely in the emerging markets, the reason being that a lot of the sales are still happening to mom-and-pop and smaller stores, which you have to physically cover. And so, the countries that come to mind to be able to do that are, of course, India, but even Russia, Southeast Asia, Africa, the Middle East, those are the markets where we are planning to invest. Overall, in how we cover the stores and get a bigger universe of coverage, it\u2019s not only people. It\u2019s also driven by the equipment that we might need, trucks or in-store display equipment, in the hotter climates for our chocolate business we need coolers. So that\u2019s really what for us is \u2013 what we mean when we say we are going to invest in route-to-market. And I think I took you through the markets that we are going to do that. As it relates to the significant emerging markets for us, while we\u2019re seeing at the moment, we\u2019re seeing double-digit growth in India, we\u2019re seeing double-digit growth in Russia. We talked about Brazil, that wasn\u2019t \u2013 \u201818 wasn\u2019t a great year, but that\u2019s a key market for us. We are also \u2013 China, of course, we need to the look at the opportunity we have for mid-single digit that we would like to increase that. And then the markets where I would say, our presence \u2013 all those markets I\u2019ve talked about there\u2019s probably close to a $1 billion for us more or less give or take. Southeast Asia, there\u2019s still a few markets there where our presence is not as big as it should be, our market share is not as big as it should be. So, we are also planning to do quite some investments in there. Steven Strycula : Okay, great. And then, Luca, since you\u2019re trying to direct our attention to focus more on profit dollar growth as an industry, how should we think \u2013 or as a company, how should we think about for \u201819 EBIT dollar trends on a constant currency basis, constant currency headwind? Luca Zaramella : Yes. Look, we \u2013 again, I think if you look at the guidance we gave in terms of EPS, 3% to 5%, we guided on interest cost at $450 million. I can \u2013 you can walk it back up and see that it is, I guess, roundabout the same EPS growth that you have. There are puts and takes obviously, but that\u2019s what it is. Steven Strycula : Alright. Thank you. Congrats on the good quarter. Luca Zaramella : Thank you. Dirk Van de Put : Thanks, Steve. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with Citi. David Driscoll : Great. Thank you, and good evening. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, David. Luca Zaramella : Hi, David. David Driscoll : Hi, two small modeling questions and then just one bigger question. What\u2019s your inflation forecast for 2019? And then on the organic revenue forecast of 2% to 3%, would it be correct to assume that, that would skew towards pricing as opposed to vol/mix? And then I have a follow-up, please. Luca Zaramella : Look, on the inflation, we are not going to break that out in terms of composition of cost inflation, ForEx inflation, commodity. I think as you model, think about commodities being pretty much in line with what we have seen this year in terms of inflation. There is clearly logistics cost that is creating a little bit of a pressure point. That was one of the key drivers that drove us increasing pricing in North America for 2019. But we also see some packaging and the ForEx to a certain extent is one of the components that is creating a little bit of pressure in terms of inflation. And again, we are taking action obviously. Clearly, we are covering our exchange rate exposure throughout the year. And we had good coverage at this point, I think we took advantage of some of the dips that we saw recently, for instance, for the Brazilian reais. On the composition of the 2% to 3%, I prefer not to go there. We are not going to give guidance on that specifically. Clearly, as you think about what we said in the context of Investor Day, we believe that volume growth is the right thing. And when you think about the various regions, I think we will continue seeing good momentum in terms of volume in EU, same in AMEA. LA, clearly, there is Argentina and some inflationary pressure. And in North America, we need to wait and see what happens with the price increase as it becomes effective in the marketplace. And so, I think there we have to see if the elasticity we model is the right one or if it is better or worse. David Driscoll : And then on the investments that you\u2019re making in 2019, can you give us some color on the pacing of those investments? And then also, one clarification on your fourth quarter comment, I believe you used the phrase something like you accelerated your investments and they began in the fourth quarter. Does that mean that the dollar amount of investments in \u201819 is now less because some of it took place in the fourth quarter, or is it just in aggregate going up because you had flexibility in the fourth quarter, but again, please don\u2019t forget the pacing part of the investment question for \u201819. Thank you. Luca Zaramella : No, I didn\u2019t forget the pacing term. So, let me answer that first. I think as you think about it, it is fairly even throughout the various quarters. Bear in mind that there are seasonal events throughout the year. So, Easter, for instance, happens to fall in 2019 a little bit but later than it did in 2018. So, it is a Q2 event and there are other seasonal events. But specifically, on A&C, it is equally phased throughout the quarter, I would say, give or take. Dirk Van de Put : The other part was, does it mean we are going to reduce our investment in \u201819? And no, the answer is no. It\u2019s clear that our intent that the investment pace of \u201819 is we are going to increase on that in \u201820, yes, maybe not at the same pace as in \u201819, but we are trying to change our circle here to a virtuous circle. So, our objective is to keep on growing and in that way increase our top-line growth. David Driscoll : Thank you very much. Dirk Van de Put : No problem. Luca Zaramella : Thank you. Operator : And our final question comes from the line of David Palmer with RBC Capital Markets. David Palmer : Thanks. Just a real general one on execution. You\u2019ve talked about trying to improve that execution and accountability by pushing some decision-making down to the regional level. It looks like from the outside like Europe has been executing pretty well, perhaps that will be tested by higher input prices and that requiring pricing, which is never easy there. And then conversely North America seemingly struggled far longer than it should have post-malware, especially with some of the competition pretty distracted. But it seems to be a little bit of an early stage here of getting tied together. Could you perhaps just walk us around the world over the regions as you see where the execution is today and where you see it going? Dirk Van de Put : Yes, maybe before I do that, we look at execution in more than in general execution. We are trying to split that up in several different groups, if I can. And, of course, there is the supply chain execution and that has to see with how good are we at buying our raw materials and our packs, how good are we running our plants, how well are we doing our demand planning and our deployment and so on and so on. And as you can imagine there\u2019s always areas anywhere in the world people can improve. But apart from the supply chain it also has to see with commercial execution then it goes from marketing and our ROI and our marketing activities around the world and how are we going to drive that. And can we use the latest technology to drive that as an in-store presence and that improvement of our route-to-market that we were talking about. So, it\u2019s wider than you might think. If I go around the world, I would say, in general, we have an objective in all regions of the world to clearly increase our ROI in our marketing and our sales activities. And everybody has an opportunity there. As it relates to the execution in the supply chain, you\u2019re right. In general, our supply chain in Europe is clearly performing better and a well-oiled machine and the U.S. is getting there or North America is getting there, but it\u2019s going to take a little bit of time. You take into account that they are still using some of our older factories to do so. As it relates to the Rest of the World, I would say, Latin America is making big strides as it relates to their supply chain and it\u2019s working very well. And in AMEA, we are also pretty happy with where we stand, the differences between the different countries but also going quite well. But I think you cannot see this as a black and white, they are doing it well or they\u2019re not doing it well. Every single region can lift itself to the next level and that\u2019s really the challenge. If you\u2019re in a company like ours and we focus on margin and cost to just make sure that we are running our plants in a better way, we run our supply chain in a better way, get the waste out of there, bring down over time, run our lines optimally, that\u2019s really what we\u2019re talking about here. And I can tell you that, anywhere in the world we have opportunity to improve that. It\u2019s more difficult in some areas, but the opportunity to my opinion is quite big like it would be in any other big company to my opinion. David Palmer : That\u2019s great. Thank you. Dirk Van de Put : Thanks. I think that brings us to the end of today. So, in closing, I would say that 2018 was a great year for us. We had good top line growth. We had solid profitability. We improved our free cash flow. We created a steady motion, a new strategy, that I think is the right approach, and it\u2019s the right time to deliver higher quality sustainable growth for the company. And as I look at 2019 and the year ahead, I\u2019m encouraged by the health of our snacking markets and the categories in which we operate. I think our teams are energized. We are happy about what we have achieved. We are excited about the future. And I think the new structure and incentive plans we\u2019ve put in place are giving people the liberty and then the potential to really go and do and make things happen. It will be a year of investment as we pointed out. But we think it\u2019s the right thing to do because we believe we can lift this business to a higher level of growth. And that will lead to better returns for investors. So, I look forward to continuing to share our progress. I will probably see you all in CAGNY, and thank you again for your interest in the company.

Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Mondelez management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President, Investor Relations of Mondelez. Please go ahead, sir. Shep Dunlap : Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO; and Luca Zaramella, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides which are available on our website, mondelezinternational.com/investors. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the Company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Some of today's prepared remarks include non-GAAP financial measures. Today, we will be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures unless otherwise noted. You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation. In today's call, Dirk will give you an overview of our results as well as progress update against our strategic priorities. Then Luca will take you through the financials and our outlook. We will close with Q&A. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Dirk. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you, Shep, and good afternoon, everybody. Six months after the launch of our new strategy, I'm encouraged by our performance and the progress that we're making. Our new strategy leverages our unique differentiators. We are a global leader in snacking. We are not in general food. We have an expansive global presence with nearly 75% of our sales outside of North America. We have large and powerful global brands and well-known local brands that resonate with consumers. And we've built a culture of cost discipline, which provides a strong platform to leverage future growth. And our teams are rallying behind are clear and focused strategy to accelerate growth and create value for our shareholders. Our new strategic plan built on these fundamental advantages and it's focused on executing on these three strategies to create a more consumer-centric organization. The first strategy is about accelerating our topline growth, the second, about driving operational excellence, and the third, about creating a winning consumer focused culture. The combination of these three leaves us well positioned to create sustainable long-term shareholder value. I am pleased with our latest financial results, which demonstrate clear progress against these strategies. These results reinforce my confidence in what we can achieve with a consumer-centric mindset and with our people in power to act with speed and agility. We started 2019 with a strong quarter. In the first three months, we delivered against our key financial metrics. Our topline growth accelerated to 3.7% with a good balance of volume mix and pricing. Our emerging markets grew at 8% and we continue to build on our momentum created with our strong execution. India, China, Southeast Asia, Russia, Mexico and Africa all performed really well and Brazil returned back to growth. Our developed markets showed sustained growth at approximately 1%, supported by Europe and a continued improvement in North America. We also expanded gross profit dollar growth of 4.5%, and we achieved OI increase of more than 4%. Now this enabled us to deliver double-digit adjusted EPS growth for the quarter. We also continue to improve cash generation with free cash flow of $200 million, while we deployed over $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. So let me share with you some more details and examples. Our first strategy which is consumer-focused growth is driven by deep and proprietary insights about snacking behaviors and occasions. The first focus area within the strategy is to extend our brands into broader snacking territories. A couple of examples from Q1. We've talked about chocobakery, which is a growing gross category opportunity globally. And this quarter, in India, our team expanded our presence in this space with a new Oreo cookie which is dipped in our Cadbury Chocolate. The result is a premium offering, which helped us gain biscuit market share in this key market. Another example is about parents wanting a playful child's treat. So we launched Cadbury Little Treasures in the UK, which is a portion controlled amount of chocolate, combined with a series of collectible toys. The launch was very strong, exceeding our expectations and helped us to increase overall Cadbury Dairy Milk sales in the UK. The second focus area of our growth strategy is to make the most of our portfolio by investing in our global and our local brands. A great example here is specific biscuits, which is an iconic historical brand in China and absolutely loved by local consumers. It is also quite uniquely adapted to Chinese taste. In this quarter we expanded the brand into rice wafers, a new segment beyond the core of the brand and it's performing really well. Our local brands in total contributed solid growth to this quarter which is an important reversal of the previous trend. I also want to mention that our global brands grew faster as well at mid single-digits. We had strong growth across most global brands, but I want to call out Oreo, our biggest brand which grew double-digit, which is quite remarkable and also Cadbury Dairy Milk, another one of our big brands which grew high single-digit. The third focus area of our consumer growth strategy is the activation of our new marketing playbook. This is driven by new and proprietary consumer insight. This is allowing us to refine our campaigns and capture more growth as consumers change how they engage with the brands they care about. The first example here, is our new global Oreo campaign, where we used our insights to deliver highly effective local adaptations. In China for instance, we took the broad global concept of staying playful and made it culturally relevant, connecting Oreo with traditional Chinese occasions. As a result, we've grown China Oreo sales double-digit. Another example is in Brazil where a new campaign for Trident called Chew2Relax made use of consumer insights to reposition the gum brand, driving a strong consumption recovery and help us regain share. The fourth focus area within our consumer growth strategy is about innovation, where we're changing to an agile innovation approach. This focus is on testing ideas in small launches, capturing learning and then scaling them across more markets. An example here, which we are particularly proud of, is our first quarter launch of PataMilka in France, which went from idea to market in six months. What we've done here is taking the Milka chocolate brand and expanding it into the broader snacking category of spreads, which is a big opportunity in a country where chocolate spread is a key part of afternoon snacking rituals. And we applied an agile reproach or approach, which had a record time from idea to market. The last focus area within the growth strategy is reaching the consumer wherever they are, with points to a stronger expansion of our presence in alternative channels, but also geographical white spaces. A great example here is a continued expansion of our distribution in the traditional trade in Indonesia. This approach is helping drive double-digit sales growth in this promising developing market. A second example was in our South Central Europe business. This area includes countries such as Romania and Bulgaria, but also Serbia, Albania, Bosnia and Croatia. All these countries together add up to more than 50 million inhabitants. The team here expanded our presence in the impulse channel in a major way. Through investments in route-to-market and sales capabilities as well as A&C and price pack architecture. All this led to solid double-digit growth of the total business in the first quarter. So now, switching to our second strategy, which is aimed at translating our consumer-centric growth model into incremental sales and margins, by focusing on improving execution across all elements of our business. This operational excellence strategy can come in the form of sales execution, for instance, where we leverage our customer supply and logistics capabilities to deliver outstanding in-store presence and availability. As you know, a particular focus here is North America, where we are making important improvements to our supply chain, as well as leveraging the power of our direct-to-store distribution model. This has helped few results; including low single-digit consumption growth and feature and display conversion up double-digit, particularly behind the recent launch of the Game of Thrones themed to Oreo pack. This pack was displayed prominently ahead of the new season airing in the U.S. We've also continued to benefit from our investments in our plants. We talked to you about Curitiba in Brazil at the CAGNY Conference. Another example would be our Suzhou plant in China, where our world-class efficiency has helped to drive strong volume growth in that market. Turning to our last strategy, which is our drive to nurture a winning growth culture. The changes we are making have given our teams a renewed sense of energy, purpose and passion. This is helping them uncover more opportunities to grow. As I mentioned before, we have launched a nimbler more empowered business unit commercial organization with the right incentives to drive growth. As a result, our commercial organization is better positioned to meet consumer needs, move fast and act entrepreneurially. We are also accelerating training across our business, focused on growth capabilities and growth mindset. And we're also launching more agile project based working systems across our different functions. Under these newly empowered themes, we are already seeing benefits, like accelerated and more efficient investment in A&C and a better split of our investment in local and global brands, as well as higher sales and faster innovation. Another initiative in the evolution of our culture is to drive step change innovation by creating an internal and an external network. The creation of our snack futures innovation and venture hub which aims to unlock snacking growth opportunities around the world is off to a great start. We have made minority investments in Uplift foods, which is focused on prebiotic functional snacks, and we also invested in a healthy snacking company called Hu, with a portfolio of vegan and paleo chocolate and biscuits. Finally, I want to talk about our purpose, because our three strategies are inspired by our company purpose of empowering people to snack right. Snacking made right relates to many aspects of our business, but not in the least to the impact we have on the world. The journey to empower people to snack right starts with how we source our ingredients. And this is an important focus for me as the leader of this company. I was fortunate recently to meet farmers and stakeholders we partner with in Ghana and Ivory Coast, as part of our Cocoa Life Sustainability Program. I witnessed firsthand how we are working everyday to strengthen the supply chain for the future and to empower farmers to achieve sustainable livelihoods. I am proud to announce that we will accelerate our sustainable Cocoa Sourcing Program. So we commit that by 2025, 100% of the Cocoa we use in our chocolates globally will be sourced through our Cocoa Life Sustainability Program. That is an increase from 43% today. This is a huge milestone for our program, our team and our company. And also an important step toward further securing sustainable growth for Mondelez International. So in summary, I feel very confident that we have the right strategies in place to capitalize on the opportunities we see in snacking and in our markets. Particularly with our strong emerging market position, and I'm also very pleased to see that we are executing against those strategies in a way that is bringing tangible improvement in our topline growth, our operational excellence and in our culture. Our first quarter results demonstrate that we've got momentum as we head into this year of investment. Our categories are performing generally well in our brands both local and global are benefiting from increased investment in advertising, creative and innovation. All of this is very motivating for our teams in the markets. I think they feel empowered and trusted and ready to perform. So let me now turn to Luca for more detail on our Q1 performance. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Dirk, and good afternoon. It was a strong first quarter and start to the year, as we built on the progress we saw in the later part of 2018. In quarter one; we delivered strong organic net revenue growth, solid increase in gross profit dollars, double-digit earnings increase and positive free cash flow. We also returned more than $1 billion to our shareholders. Growth was broad-based as we posted positive results across each region and business unit, driven by another quarter of balanced volume and pricing. It is important to note that the vast majority of Easter shipments happened in Q1, generally eliminating phasing impact between Q1 and Q2. Adjusted gross profit dollars on a constant currency basis grew more than revenue in Q1, similar to Q4, and we continue to make critical investments to our business, in order to support our long-term strategic initiatives, across brands, go-to-market and innovation, consistently with our plans for the full-year. Organic net revenue increased 3.7% for the first quarter. This increase was driven by solid execution across our business and continued momentum in emerging markets, where we posted growth of 8% with a good balance of volume and pricing. Excluding Argentina, emerging markets grew 6.5%. We delivered strong results across the Board, in India, China, Southeast Asia, Russia, Mexico and Africa. In addition, Brazil returned to growth this past quarter. We also delivered solid performance in developed markets, supported by growth in Europe and continued steady improvement in the North American business. On a regional basis, Europe once again demonstrated another quarter of solid execution as it delivered revenue growth of 2.7% lapping the strongest quarter last year. This growth was volume driven and broad-based with solid increases across chocolate, biscuits and candy. Russia grew double-digits, while Germany and the UK also delivered solid results. AMEA grew 6.1% due to strength in several key markets and growth in every business unit. India once again delivered a quarter of double-digit growth powered by a strong market environment and great execution in both chocolate and biscuit. China grew mid single-digit behind great results in both biscuits, as we grow both global and local brands and gum, where our stride proposition continues to gain traction with consumers. Southeast Asia posted mid single-digit growth with good results in biscuits and chocolate. And Africa also grew with chocolate, candy, beverages and gum all posting growth. Latin America grew 8.4% due in part to Argentina. Growth excluding Argentina was low single-digit. Mexico delivered mid single-digit growth and Brazil returned to growth in Q1. As a result of trends in chocolate and solid results in biscuit. We are encouraged by the progress we made in Brazil and expect steady improvement throughout the year. North America grew 0.5% in Q1 due to continued momentum in the U.S. Biscuit business, partially offset by gum and halls declines. We delivered biscuit share gains across nearly all channels, driven in part by strong performance and execution behind our Oreo brand. We made improvements in service levels in the quarter. That said, there is still work to be done to drive better consistency. We continue to expect progress in 2019, albeit not linear with overall modest growth for the year. Now let's review our profit performance. In the first quarter, we grew adjusted gross profit dollars, nearly 5% on a constant currency basis. This increase was driven by continued productivity, volume leverage and pricing. Gross profit growth offset partially by additional SG&A, drove OI dollar expansion of more than 4% on a constant currency basis. This translated into adjusted OI margin of 16.7%, which is flat versus the previous year and consistent with our expectations. During the quarter, we made some additional investments in A&C, route-to-market and Innovation, in line with our plan. In addition, we also lapped a favorability in indirect taxes matter for the previous year and incurred expenses related to the resolution of some legal and indirect tax matters. On the regional basis, gross margin expansion and continued cost execution drove profit dollar improvements in three of our four regions. Europe grew adjusted OI dollars by 8% due to solid volume leverage. AMEA improved operating income dollars by nearly 17%, due to strong volume-based growth and productivity. Latin America OI dollars declined by approximately 19%, mostly due to the prior year impact of an indirect tax matter in Brazil. Finally, North America, which increased adjusted OI dollars by nearly 9% on a constant currency basis, due to pricing, net of cost and improved service levels, which more than offset logistics inflation. Let me spend a moment on category highlights. Our three snacking categories continue to demonstrate solid growth rates, growing on a year-to-date basis by almost 3%. This builds off the momentum of last year and reinforces our confidence that we are participating in an attractive space with the right geographical footprint. Now moving to shares. Overall, we had or gained shares in 60% of our business. Our biscuits business grew 3.4%, approximately 80% of our revenue grew or held share in this category, including our three most sizable businesses : U.S., China and France. In chocolate, our business grew 5.9%, approximately 35% of our revenue grew or held share including Russia and Brazil. It is important to note that we over indexed in Easter versus many competitors. So we would expect share performance to improve next quarter. Gum and Candy growth was down slightly, reflecting weaker results in the U.S., mostly due to Halls. About 30% of our revenue in this business gained or held share including strength in China gum and Mexico candy. Now turning to earnings per share. Q1 EPS grew approximately 13% on a constant currency basis. This growth primarily reflected operating gains driven by strong revenue results as well as by share repurchases and low taxes rates. I'll now move on to our free cash flow results. We delivered positive free cash flow for the quarter of $200 million, which was in line with our plans. We continue to execute well on our working capital metrics and net income conversion. In terms of capital deployment, we returned $1 billion in capital to our shareholders in the first quarter. This included approximately 650 million in share repurchases at an average cost of $44.20 per share and $380 million in dividends. Moving to the outlook. We are maintaining our organic net revenue growth target of 2% to 3%. We feel good about the quality of the topline results for Q1 and the growth across all the regions. Yet, while we are encouraged by the strong results, it is still early in the year. We are also maintaining our view of adjusted earnings per share growth of 3% to 5%, although we delivered double-digit growth in the first quarter, we did get some benefit from a few items that were below the operating line, including tax and interest that are not expected to contribute in the same way in subsequent quarters. We have also been clear that this is an important year of investments for brands, sales and innovation to drive more sustainable topline growth over the long-term. With that, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Good afternoon, everybody. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, Andrew. Luca Zaramella : Hi, Andrew. Andrew Lazar : Hi. Maybe we'll just pick up on the organic growth piece. Obviously as you mentioned, it's just the first quarter, but I guess with the strong start to the year on the organic topline, maybe why is 2% to 3% still the right number for the full-year and particularly as pricing seems to be coming through nicely. And as part of that were there any things that maybe were on discrete benefits that you can help quantify to organic growth in the first quarter, whether that's \u2013 you had mentioned a bit of a benefit, I think from Easter and perhaps anything related to like a Brexit inventory build and things of that nature? Luca Zaramella : Yes. So I'll start by saying that we are clearly very pleased with the way Q1 played out, and it builds a little bit on the momentum we saw in the second half of 2018. I think it is also important to taking a look at the results to realize that those were really good quality results. I think the teams around the world did a great job and I'll let Dirk talk maybe a little bit later, but this clearly adds to the conviction of the long-term potential of Mondelez and the merits of the strategy we put together and we presented to you. We were very clear that in 2019, we really want to solidify the progress we saw toward the end of last year. And we believe we really need to see these growth rates above guidance for at least another quarter before we revise our outlook. I want to remind you that this is an investment year and some of the investments we're making are for the benefit of the medium to long-term as well. So it will take a little bit of time for those investments to positively affect our revenue. And we clearly remain optimistic about our outlook, but as we've said many times, we want to be also thoughtful given some of the uncertainties that might post risk throughout the year, clearly Brexit is one of those. We also have some share losses and we need to address those in the remainder of the year. To your specific question, at the time of guidance last quarter, we said that there would be a 50 basis points positive impact due to Easter in the second quarter because of timing. Realities after that guidance we sat down with the trade specifically in the UK and we decided that ahead of the potential Brexit exit that line, which was March 29, it was better for either one to put the Easter stock in the trade itself which we did. So in terms of year-over-year, Easter happens to be neutral in terms of shipment on the quarter. So there is no timing effect. And so I think it is in relative terms, a clean quarter. Again, we're very pleased with the way we see the markets performing. But as I said, it is still early in the year to call up the guidance at this point. Andrew Lazar : That's really helpful. Thank you for that color. And then just very quickly, Dirk, the better overall volume result even light of the pricing is notable. So I guess where are we in the process of the shifting mindset for more of a cost focus to a growth focus. And I guess how responsible is the new compensation scheme that rewards the volume growth component specifically? Thank you. Dirk Van de Put : Thanks, Andrew. Yes, one of the key elements of our strategy was to create volume growth, which we haven't had for quite a while for a number of reasons. I think you are only growing as a company, if you're volume is going up, i.e. that you're selling more product to more consumers, but also because it gives us overheads leverage. We have installed capacity and to use that every extra ton we put through the plants comes at relatively speaking, lower cost than the previous one. So we try to help our teams to think differently about this. First of all, there was the incentive plan, which we did a number of changes and not in the least, we started to reward our teams for volume growth. There's also a better balance between topline and bottom line growth in our incentives. We also push down incentives in the sense that before most people would be rewarded our region was performing, we now have people being rewarded at the business unit level. So it is more of a direct impact. Before we used to have 60% of their results based on financial results, we've moved that up to 80%. So there is a more direct relation there and we also made sure that our long-term incentives are very performance based. So for sure that has played a role, a big role, I would say in these results. The other one that is really helping in the sense is the fact that we are focusing more and more on dollar gross profit growth, and that makes you think a little bit different on how you generate that versus a percentage of gross profit. And so that means that volume also through that sort of thinking is being stimulated. So overall, yes, we are at close to 2%, 1.7% volume growth in the quarter. That's pretty good and we want to keep it like that because we can clearly see the benefit. Andrew Lazar : Thanks everyone. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Andrew. Operator : And your next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel. Christopher Growe : Hi. Good afternoon. Dirk Van de Put : Hi. Luca Zaramella : Hi. Christopher Growe : Hi. I had a question for you, if I could start on pricing that was obviously quite strong in Latin America and you discussed the benefit from Argentina in the quarter. Just curious, does that continue across the year so that the continued kind of boost to your price realization for the overall company? Luca Zaramella : Yes. Look, we are very pleased with pricing and the balance we see with volume mix. As I described pricing last year, we clearly focused on a couple of parts of the world, one was our developing markets, which Argentina is a component. I think there is a little bit higher pricing this quarter, than we saw on average last year. But the simple reality is Argentina in Q1 is lapping last year, a relatively benign inflation and ForEx. So the devaluation ramped up in the second part of the year. We moved to higher rates of inflation in the second part of the year in Q2 as well. But the second one about Argentina is we are striking a better balance between pricing and volume, so the volume component is better than we have seen last year. So all in all, I think Argentina will continue growing at the rate that is not going to be necessarily the Q1 rate. But excluding Argentina again, when I look at developing markets that grew 8.5% in the quarter, give or take, excluding Argentina, we are looking at a 6.5%, which is clearly building on the great momentum of last year, and the good news is that that growth rate is comprised both of volume for the vast majority and pricing. So we are very pleased. The other one is North America, where last year we had positive pricing. As I said last year, we used pretty much all the pricing levers promo, price pack architecture and line pricing. We announced toward the end of last year, a price increase in the U.S. We are pleased with the way it is going into the market. And again, when we look at biscuits, which is the biggest category we have in the U.S., and we look at consumption, nice numbers in terms of category growth between volume and pricing and importantly with share gains. So we will continue to see pricing for the remainder of the year. I think Argentina and the impact associated with it will come down in the quarters to come. Christopher Growe : Okay. Thank you for that. I had just one other quick follow-up, basically as you put in place \u2013 a more of a focus on the local brands over the power brands, I just wanted to understand, and it sounds like Luca you had said maybe the level of investment this quarter was what you expected in relation to that strategy. Is that something that's taking effect right away? Is there a pipeline of new products that has to be developed? Is there a more marketing to be done there? Just wanted to understand how that manifest itself in this situation as you kind of transition your focus as well for some of the local brands? Dirk Van de Put : Yes. I'll take that one. Yes. So the first element there is that we are increasing our investments about $150 million this year that largely goes to A&C. And if I would split that between local and global brands that is more going to local brands than to global brands. We are also investing in route-to-market, India, Russia, China, South Central Europe. If we see there, there is more sales people, more trucks on the road, and we're also investing in R&D. The R&D investment is probably taking a little bit more time, but increasing our A&C investment in our brands and giving a little push on our local brands that is really having an immediate effect, and also the route-to-market of course immediate effect. But we do still believe that the big benefit of that extra investment still has to show up, so we want to see an acceleration in the return we get on it. And overall, I would also like to say that we don't see this as a one-off year where we do this. Our overall thinking is that as we invest more this year, we will get higher topline growth, which will lead to a solid gross profit growth and then we more or less flow half of that to the bottom line and reinvest half of that into our A&C and so on. So we see this continuing getting ourselves into a virtuous circle. And that would mean that every year we increase our investment. Christopher Growe : Great. Thank you very much. Dirk Van de Put : Okay. Thank you, Chris. Operator : Your next question is from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, Bryan. Bryan Spillane : I had a couple of questions related to the balance sheet, I guess. The first one, Luca it looks like total debt in the quarter was up sequentially by about $1 billion, and yet even interest expense came in more favorably. So I guess one question related to that is just, is there anything timing related that drove the debt higher in the quarter and then just I guess the disconnect between interest expense coming down, but debt going up? Luca Zaramella : Look, I'll start by talking about the interest cost. I think on the interest cost Q1 at $80 million, it came quite frankly a little bit more favorable than we thought. The reality is we are still benefiting particularly year-over-year from additional net investment hedges that had a positive impact. We are quite pleased with the rates we have in terms of all the interest costs. I would just want to remind you that we have $4.5 billion of euro denominated debt that is partly coming due in the second part of the year. That debt is at zero cost, actually negative cost for part of it, and we will renew that with a longer tenure, we will incur in additional interest cost. So yes, maybe the interest cost guidance of $450 million is a little bit on the conservative side. But I think again, we have to see how the year plays out. I think there has been a little bit of fluctuations around the interest rate. On the debt, it is true the debt went up. I don't think it went up, I'm looking at net debt, so including cash that we have some additional cash compared to the end of the year. And the reason being that there is particularly in Q1 some seasonality due to Easter falling later, receivables went up a bit. So we have a little bit more liquidity in the system. But the top of that went up pretty much because we renewed some debt. We have as you know, still relatively low cash flow compared to the yearly projection, so $200 million in Q1 versus the $2.8 billion that we are going to generate in the year. And then we took the opportunity to buyback shares as I said at $44 million. So between share and dividends, we paid a little bit north of $1 billion. So debt went up a bit. I think in terms of leverage, we are in the ballpark of the number we had at the end of last year. So I think it is pretty much timing. Bryan Spillane : And so I guess, as we're thinking about the timing and relative as we're thinking about net debt for the full-year, absent something that we don't know about like an acquisition or someone along those lines. You're not expecting net debt to really increase for the year? Luca Zaramella : Maybe it will increase a bit again in line with EBITDA, I would say, so but I wouldn't expect leverage to go up again. We are committed to the credit ratings we have. We just got reaffirmed as one of the agencies reiterated the rating. So we feel good where we are. I think you should project the same situation as of the end of last year. Bryan Spillane : Okay. Just one more related one. There has been some stories about the potential for Mondelez being interested in Arnott's and obviously I'm not passing a comment specifically about that, but just a deal that size seems large relative to what you described in M&A. So maybe either Dirk or Luca, if you could just remind us how you're thinking about M&A, both in terms of strategy, but more just size? How you're thinking about what types of size of deals you'd be looking at? Dirk Van de Put : Yes. As we have stated, our preference is for bolt-on acquisitions, looking at the different white spaces that we have around the world. As you go around that you look at biscuits, chocolates, or gum and candy markets, we still have areas where we are not present or not big enough and that will be our preference to sort of filling our geographical landscape. We have the same in existing markets where in certain channels or there are certain areas in our categories like health and wellness premium, digital businesses that we would be interested in. But overall, we do not expect those to be big deals. In the case of Arnott's, it's Australia, it's biscuits, it's quite sizable business. It fits in that white space thinking. It's obviously a process that's still ongoing. It's probably a little bit higher than what we would originally start when we thought about acquisitions. But at the same time, we have very clear expectations in the term of returns and in term of leverage, and we want to stay very disciplined buyers. So as long as it fits into the framework that we've set into our strategic plan, we will do so. But if it falls out of that we will not make a deal. Bryan Spillane : All right. Thanks, everybody. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Bryan. Operator : And your next question is from Steve Strycula with UBS. Steven Strycula : Hi. Good afternoon. Dirk Van de Put : Hi. Luca Zaramella : Hi, Steve. Steven Strycula : So two-part question. First for Luca. Just to on an apples-to-apples basis for first quarter, I know you have Argentina, Brexit, and Easter to Andew Lazar's question, would you say if we kind of take those three pieces into consideration, the underlying organic sales number was close to about a 3 percentage point number? Luca Zaramella : Again, the way I commented on Brexit it was, we decided to put it Easter into the system ahead of a potential exit or even hard Brexit. So in terms of shipments, I wouldn't attribute to Brexit any impact year-over-year. It just happened that Easter this year fell in Q2, and we decided to put selling into the system in Q1. So, Q1 2018 versus 2019 no material changes. I think as I said, Argentina is a little bit higher. We gave you the number between developing markets with or without Argentina. The relevance of Argentina in the quarter is a little bit higher than last year. We expect that to turn down. So I would say, look in shipment terms, I think it is really a clean quarter now. I think you saw the categories, particularly around chocolate, where we have some challenges, part of it is due to timing. We need to work on the shares. And as I said, if you're trying to see if there are opportunities in terms of topline for the year, I would say, great start to the year. We are very pleased. As I said, I would like to see the second quarter above guidance for us to be able to call guidance out for the year. Steven Strycula : Okay. And then a follow-up for Dirk. Dirk you recently did an interview with a German newspaper and admittedly my German isn't so fresh. So I was hoping you might help bridge a few comments or add some transparency as to what you meant when you were describing some of the opportunity set for a big global brands relative to home-grown brand, and then to wrap up, your comment on the monetization potential for the coffee assets in that paper. Thank you so much. Dirk Van de Put : Yes. Well, the two comments were not that new. I think the first one as it related to brands was that I have \u2013 and I think the rest of the management team in the company's shares that believes that the days of the big global brands that cover all areas and under which you can do everything and that will lead to significant growth, that's not necessarily what the future looks like. We can see the phenomenon very clearly with the insurgent brands in the U.S., which is translating in sales a little bit around the world. So the comment was related to my opinion that we need to keep on growing our global brands. And as we explained, we are very happy to have our two biggest brands growing almost both of them double-digit is quite good. But at the same time, we believe local brands more and more will have a significant role to play. They are closer to the local consumers. They feel more connected to it and so the comment was meant to say, we believe our strategy is the right one. On the coffee assets, the comment there was that they asked me, what was the future of our coffee assets in the business? I said that for the time being, we\u2019re very happy. We've got different investments. We're seeing good growth. We are happy what the management teams are doing there and they still have some good potential. On the longer-term, the comment was that obviously we divested or partially divested our coffee business. We are not running it anymore. And over time, we will exit those assets. We don't know when, but clearly it's something that is in the plan. Those were the two comments. Steven Strycula : Okay, thanks. I'll pass the line. Dirk Van de Put : Okay. Operator : And your next question is from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Kenneth Goldman : Hi. Thank you. Dirk Van de Put : Hi. Luca Zaramella : Hi Ken. Kenneth Goldman : In North America, there was a fairly significant gap between your takeaway as reported by Nielsen in the quarter and your actual North American sales. I know you addressed this a little bit, but I'm just hoping for a little bit more color in your view what the biggest reasons were for maybe the reported numbers coming in a little bit more below takeaway then what some of us expected? Dirk Van de Put : Yes, yes. And I don't know, which takeaway numbers that you are looking at, but you probably are comparing our biscuit takeaway numbers to our overall net revenue numbers... Kenneth Goldman : No, I mean including everything. It's still a little bit lower. Dirk Van de Put : Yes. It's still a bit lower. I would say our takeaway overall would be around 2% and then the net revenue is 0.5%. Clearly biscuits are doing very well for us. We have a good category growth. We're increasing our market share, and we clearly see that in the consumption. We do have as much smaller part of our business is related to gum and candy, and in the first quarter we saw a slowdown in those two categories, particularly in candy, we think that's only driven by Easter falling later into the year this year. We think that's going to come back in gum as been always a little bit under performing. So that's clearly a challenge as I bridge. They are not growing at the level that the rest of the consumption is growing. Particularly hard hit was halls in the quarter, because of the cold-season not being very good and also that we have some more pressure from vicks competitive activity. The other factor that you need to take into account is that the retailers still are lowering their stock levels and that shows up in our net revenue, but doesn't show up in the consumption numbers. So that's clearly something that plays a role for us. So those are largely the biggest factors, there is potentially also a little bit of non-measured channels that don't show up in the consumption numbers that you see, which we're not growing through the same rate. So that also causes that difference between the two. Those would be the big reasons, but we were able to perfectly make that bridge between our net revenue that we're seeing in consumption. Kenneth Goldman : Okay. Thank you very much for that. That's helpful. My follow-up will be quick. In terms of the destocking you've seen which certainly isn't limited to Mondelez. Any idea when we can expect a little bit of a slowdown there? I mean, there can't be destocking forever, and yet it seems to be happening for longer than what maybe some companies were anticipating? Dirk Van de Put : Yes. So first of all, some of the rollouts were not the whole country at the same time. So that certainly plays a role. Then also the systems are now \u2013 so the rollouts were spread over more than one year. The second effect that you have there is, it's an automatic system, and as that automatic system sees for instance our gum sales go down that will lead to lower stock levels de-referencing some of our SKUs, and so that sort of has an extra effect in the year, as our sales will start to go up. That will probably lead to a slight increase of our stock levels in the trade over time. So we do believe that this difference between our net revenue and the consumption we see will disappear in the coming months or quarters. And that it will be more reasoned out. Kenneth Goldman : So, just to follow-up and make sure and I apologize for having the call little bit. But just to make sure I understand, if your takeaway numbers in Nielsen are disappointing in a certain category, the customers will automatically order less, I didn't \u2013 I knew that was something in there, but just want to make sure that that's what you're sort of suggesting? Dirk Van de Put : They don't order unless they will \u2013 yes, in a way they do, but they will lower their stock level, because if the sales go down, they need to have less stock. So you see an effect from that to... Luca Zaramella : What Dirk was saying, yes, is that in gums specifically, we see a little bit of trade reassessing their stock position and as consumption goes down in our SKUs. They adjust stock down. So it was just refining to gum for that comment, I assume. Dirk Van de Put : Yes. Kenneth Goldman : Thank you. Operator : And your next question is from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey, good evening, folks. Thank you for the question. Dirk Van de Put : Hi. Luca Zaramella : Hi Jason. Jason English : I've got two questions. First a quick one, is your business going to be affected by the price controls implemented in Argentina? And if so what are the implications there? Luca Zaramella : I think you know the answer to that question is, at this point, no. I think as the new relatively new President came into play, actually all price controls were removed. I think the exchange rate environment is in terms of ability to move money out of the country and to remit money at growth, as being better than in the past. So the simple answer is, no. We don't have price controlled categories at this point in time, but we don't know clearly what lies ahead. Jason English : Got it. Thank you. And then my second question. I totally appreciate and respect your focus on gross profit dollar growth. But I'm still trying to make sure that I understand my margin bridges. And I was a bit surprised that we didn't see a bit more margin strength this quarter, given the sequential acceleration of pricing, given there is still pretty easy comp that you're cycling against here in the first quarter. Can you walk us through some of the puts and takes that you're seeing there, whether in terms of inflation and productivity and maybe some mixed drags between gum weak or you pushing into local brands or investing et cetera? Luca Zaramella : Yes. Look, I think it is clear that we are trying to move the mindset from gross margin percentages to gross profit dollars or from that matter from high percentages to high dollars. I think the gross profit line was in line with expectations and grew 4.5%, which is ahead of revenue we added 30 basis points of gross margin. As I dissect the business on the gross margin line, quite frankly, we are very pleased with what we're seeing in three regions out of four. There is Latin America that is facing some pressure and last year we did over strategies for ForEx that were absolutely exceptional, and we are lapping quite positive ForEx rates in Latin America in Q1. But with the exclusion of Latin America quite frankly, I see strength across all the other three regions and volume leverage is coming into play. Pricing, net of cost is positive and clearly we deliver productivity. Below the line or below gross profit we invested in A&C, route-to-market in R&D as we've said. But and we also deliver cost savings in the operator line, so underlying savings both in gross profit and overheads is quite good in line with expectations. We happened to lap a little bit of one-time as last year for some VAT related benefits that we got into the P&L. And as I said in my remarks, we are also \u2013 we have made accruals in Q1, in relation to some legal matters and again indirect taxes. So the year-over-year impact is round about $40 million. So when I exclude these items, I think the P&L that we deliver in Q1 was great. On Latin America, I wouldn't be at this point overly concerned. We achieved what we have in plan and as Brazil specifically speaks out for the remainder of the year, we should be benefiting from better leverage as well there. So you might be a little bit below what you had in mind, but it is in line with what we had internally and importantly I see three regions on solid ground. Jason English : Very good. Thank you. And congrats on the strong start. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Jason. Operator Your next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, guys. Dirk Van de Put : Hi. Dara Mohsenian : I wanted to get a bit more detail on the pricing environment in Latin America, and in some of the key markets ex-Argentina, because it was a big sequential improvement in trend. So did Brazil and Mexico see some sequential improvement in Q1 versus Q4, and maybe just detail the competitive environment you're seeing there particularly in Brazil. And then from a volume standpoint, we're still seeing declines in Latin America versus very healthy growth you're seeing in other emerging markets around the world and a lot of progress we've see in some of the other regions. So just curious on if we should get more of a balance between volume and pricing going forward in Latin America, and your ability to accelerate volume growth there like we've seen in some of the other regions? Thanks. Luca Zaramella : Yes. Maybe I'll start with the volume part of the question and Dirk can give you a little bit of flavor around both Brazil and Mexico and what we're seeing. Yes, look, Latin America as historically shown negative volume. I think if you look at the volume mix this quarter it happens to be a little bit better than what you have seen in the last few years. Remember that we used the full array of pricing tools to pricing the marketplace. So one component of volume is downsizing and there is an impact, specifically in Brazil around that. But all-in-all, I think you should expect also for the remainder of the year a little bit of volume pressure. Having said that, I think there should be sequential improvement. In Argentina, as I said in one of the previous questions, volume came in better than last year. We are striking a much better balance between volume and pricing. And I think this move to gross profit dollars and the opportunity we have to optimize reliable consistent and repeatable volume growth. I think it is quintessential to them all. So I think all-in-all, we are also pleased with the volume dynamics we are seeing overall in Latin America and hopefully we see an improvement in the remainder of the year. On the Brazil, Mexico, Dirk if you want to...? Dirk Van de Put : Yes. So, one observation on Latin America was that all our business units grew at the same time. In fact, all our business units around the world had growth. So that made the quarter quite appealing to it. To talk a little bit more about Brazil. We feel that Brazil is on an uptick. It's improving. It's not totally stable yet. There's certainly a number of macro uncertainties that are still there. But overall, we saw the business return back to growth, which we felt good about. As we look at categories, the chocolate category was in slight decline, but that of course includes the impact of the late Easter. And in terms of our Q1 revenue, our chocolate grew high single-digits. One of the successes there was the launch of a product called Bis Xtra, under our Bis brand and there was a new type of wafers, covers with chocolate that's doing very well there. As it relates to the gum category, we saw high single-digit revenue growth. This was driven also, sorry, the category was growing and our revenue was growing, largely driven by Trident and Trident launched a new campaign called Chew2Relax and that had a significant impact. And then also powdered beverages is very important for us, and where we also see the category getting back to growth, which was not the case last year. There we lost a little bit of share. In the past year and we are starting to recover, but we still have some recovery to do. So overall in Brazil, I would say surprising situation because that was the origin of your question is relatively healthy. It's not as big as it is in Argentina and largely in line with our expectations. By the way, the overall effect look of Argentina on our result, I think compared to last year's growth was 0.2. So there is an effect, but it's not that dramatic I would say, as you might expect. And then maybe to talk about Mexico, a little bit. Mexico, we see a very good situation. We are growing mid single-digits and pricing is relatively mitigated there. Also so, I would say if you look at Latin America where the pricing is higher than it has been in the past years is largely in Argentina, the rest looks largely in line with expectations. Dara Mohsenian : Great, thanks. It's very helpful. Dirk Van de Put : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Alexia Howard : Good evening, everyone. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, Alexia. Luca Zaramella : Hi, Alexia. Alexia Howard : Hi there. So two quick ones. First of all, on the A&C spend. How much was it up this quarter and how much are you expecting it to be up to the full-year either in percentage terms or dollar terms? Is it going to accelerate from here or was there a big burst this quarter, and then it slows down? And then my second question, just coming back to the beginning of the Q&A, you mentioned that one of the reasons that you didn't want to raise guidance for the full-year. It's early and there are clearly some risks on the horizon and Brexit is one of them. Is that the main one or there are other uncertainties out there that you're keeping an eye on? Thank you and I'll pass it on. Luca Zaramella : Yes. Thank you for the question, Alexia. So on A&C, it was up in Q1. We're not going to start giving you details by A&C spending, but as particularly we look at working you can see which is dollars we spend behind initiatives online or Television, etc. That was up quite a bit year-over-year. I expect that increase to continue for the remainder of the year. And actually the overall A&C spending is going to sequentially increase in the quarters to come. Nothing that wasn't expected, it is baked into the guidance. To your second question, yes, Brexit is clearly unknown at this point in time and it is the biggest risk that that we know of. But as I learned many times in my life, I mean sometimes the unexpected comes as well. And so there are a few elections around the world. I don't know the outcomes of those yet, but there might be some uncertainties. Again, as I look at the categories, they are displaying solid growth in many places. We are fairly pleased with developing market. Having said that, given it is just one quarter. We decided to keep guidance the same. Alexia Howard : Perfect. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Alexia. Operator : And your last question is from the line of David Driscoll with Citi. David Driscoll : Great. Thank you and good evening. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, David. Luca Zaramella : Hi, David. David Driscoll : I've got a couple of questions here that I wanted to ask. Just going back on Bryan's question about the debt, can you just go over how much of that euro debt has a negative interest rate? What is that negative interest rate? And when do you actually refi it? I'm still struggling with the $80 million interest expense in the quarter and how we get to this $450 million? And then you made the comment, well maybe that's a little bit conservative? Can you help me figure out how conservative? Luca Zaramella : Look, just let's get the number straight on the debt. The net debt that we had at the end of last year was round about $17.3 billion. Okay. And it was the total leverage of 3.3x on EBITDA. At the end of Q1, net debt inclusive of cash, which I said increased around the world because of seasonality, specifically around Easter. It was $17.8 billion with the leverage round about 3.4x. So those are the numbers. On the interest rate and the cost $80 million is clearly a number that if you multiply by four doesn't get you the guidance we gave on interest rate. Having said that, there is an impact on net investments hedges, and particularly year-over-year that impact is going to subside. And then it was not uncommon particularly on short tenure debt to be able to borrow money in Europe at the negative interest cost. I'm not going to give you the details of what that these, but it is negative, so we are getting paid for that. And as we renew that debt at current rates, we are going to incur a cost and not last, we are going to increase tenure of the debt we are going issue for \u2013 in the second part of the year. So that is causing a little bit of \u2013 I mean such cost headwind that we have projected this year. As I said, I believe we are going to be a little bit better than the $450 million, but I think again, it is still early in the year given some uncertainties. Remember we have multiple interest cost components in the year. We have short-term borrowings that we do around the world. There is the net investment hedges. There is CP, commercial paper. The free cash flow came in better in Q1 than last year. So there is upside most likely. I think it is early for me to quantify it. I wouldn't expect to \u2013 a massive number here though in terms of upside. David Driscoll : That's very helpful. On the phasing of the investments this year and I think it's around $150 million. Did the first quarter, more or less get its proportional share, did 25% of that $150 million go into Q1, then I'm really just trying to get a sense here for the pacing of these investments. Previously, I think you guys had said that you did expect it would be rather even throughout the year, but now that we've got one quarter in the book, so then you could update us on that one. And then Dirk, I had one final one. You were about to bite on this one earlier in the questions. But I'd like you just to talk about that for key growth in the United States, the 6.5 points of volume growth that we're seeing in the Nielsen data and just the sustainability of that kind of take away and what's driving in. It's pretty special obviously it's in cookies and not in the other portions of the U.S. business. But I'm still just curious as to what's driving it in the sustainability of that cookie growth? Thank you. Dirk Van de Put : Okay. Well, as it relates to the investments, it is evenly spread if anything, the first quarter was probably a bit lower than its fair share. So, it is not that we have an extraordinary spending in this quarter and now with tempers down, I would say we are expecting as Luca said the sequential increase of the spending as we go through the quarters. As it relates to what we are seeing, yes, obviously that's not captured in our consumption numbers that you see. But you're referring to a report that I think came out recently. We do see quite some substantial increase of consumption. I would say there in biscuits in North America, that I think that's sort of a particular situation, we have Easter was in \u2013 is in those numbers. So that's going to have an effect. We also just ran a very successful promotion on Oreo, The Games of Thrones edition, which is a one-off. So I'm expecting as those big effects sort of passes that consumption will go back to the normal 3%-ish that we're seeing. But yes, we clearly have seen in April, a big boost in consumption and we are quite happy about that. David Driscoll : Congratulations and thank you, guys. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you. Luca Zaramella : Thank you. Operator : And I'll now turn the call back over to Dirk. Dirk Van de Put : Okay. Thank you. So as I said at the outset, I feel good about our performance in this first quarter and the progress we are making as the strategic plan. We are encouraged by this strong start, and we believe we are well positioned to deliver on our financial commitments and keep on funding our future growth. We want to continue to invest for the long-term to support our brands, our sales, on innovation and our quality. And we think we are entering into that virtuous circle that we're talking about to build this sustainable momentum and keep on creating value for our shareholders for many years to come. So thank you for the time. Thank you for your interest in the Company. And talk to you in about a quarter. Luca Zaramella : Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour including remarks by Mondelez management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President Investor Relations for Mondelez. Please go ahead sir. Shep Dunlap : Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van de Put our Chairman and CEO; and Luca Zaramella our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides which are available on our website mondelezinternational.com/investors.During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.As we discuss our results today, unless otherwise noted, we will be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures which adjust for certain items included in our GAAP results. In addition we provide our year-over-year growth on a constant-currency basis unless otherwise noted. You can find the comparable GAAP measures and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation.In today's call Dirk will give you an overview of our results as well as progress update against our strategic priorities, then Luca will take you through the financials and our outlook. We'll close with Q&A.With that, I'll now turn the call over to Dirk. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you, Shep, and good afternoon, everybody. Today, we're reporting strong second quarter results as our category leadership position and solid execution allows us to capitalize on strong snacking fundamentals in most of our key markets.Our first half performance demonstrates that our more consumer-centric approach and focus on our strategic priorities is working. We're delivering volume-driven topline growth, while driving earnings growth and improved cash flow generation. Given this performance we're raising our full year outlook for organic net revenue growth to 3% plus which Luca will discuss in more detail later in the call.As you can see on my first slide, it is clear that our unique position as a global snacking leader and our unique approach to growing our business is driving us forward. We have a strong portfolio of global and local brands combined with an advantaged manufacturing and distribution network.We have leading positions in both developed and emerging markets and we have talented and committed colleagues who are energized by the progress they are seeing. The combination of these advantages are helping to generate volume growth, which by virtue of our efficient operations, generates more fuel to further invest in expanding our topline as well as create long-term value for our shareholders.We create that value through our consumer-centric growth strategy a reminder of which is on Slide 5. Our long-term goal is to deliver attractive dollar profit increase driven by solid topline growth as well as free cash flow expansion by focusing our business on three clear priorities; first to accelerate topline growth, second to drive operational excellence, and third to build a winning growth culture.Turning to the financial results for the second quarter on the next slide. We delivered strong performance against many key metrics. Our topline growth accelerated to 4.6% underpinned by solid category performance improving share trends and volume growth.Our emerging markets grew 7.6% while developed markets showed 2.8% growth. Our adjusted operating income grew in line with revenue as volume leverage and cost savings were partly reinvested in strengthening our brands and capabilities for the future.We reported high single-digit adjusted EPS growth and free cash flow reached $581 million since the start of the year. We also continued to make great progress on living our purpose across the organization including through our sustainability agenda.To talk briefly about our geographies, revenue grew across all four of our regions and was underpinned by market share gains. Our North American business grew 2.5% led by strong U.S. Biscuits result. Our AMEA business grew 4.7% overall with strong growth in China and India. Our European business grew 3.9% boosted by the U.K., Germany, and Russia. And in Latin America, growth was 10.9% or 4.2% excluding Argentina.Let me share a little more detail on progress against our strategy turning to Slide 7. We committed to increasing and optimizing investment behind our brands both global and local and our channels in order to create a solid foundation for future growth.Year-to-date, we have driven a total increase in organic net revenue of over $500 million and an increase in adjusted operating income of almost $100 million on a constant-currency basis.This investment is helping us to maintain strong growth momentum in two of our biggest brands Oreo and Cadbury Dairy Milk, thanks in part to expansion of distribution in key markets and channels.At the same time, we are putting more emphasis than in the past on our local jewels. For example Nutter Butter, an iconic U.S. brand that celebrated its 50th anniversary this year is delivering double-digit growth thanks to fresh investments.We're also fueling channel expansion. We have continued to expand our rural distribution network in major markets like India. This will give us an even stronger competitive advantage in a market where we're already leaders.In Southeast Asia, further investment in modern and traditional trade has enabled us to accelerate our fast-growing chocolate business in countries like Indonesia resulting in double-digit growth and share gains. We continue to build our e-commerce business as well. Our global e-commerce reported net revenue grew more than 30% in the quarter, while our U.S. e-commerce business grew almost 80%. We also saw continued strong growth in markets like China, where partnerships with e-tailers are helping us gain share.Operational excellence remains critical to our success. I was particularly pleased to see our Easter execution this year. During a particularly important time for our chocolate business, we achieved best-in-class service levels in key markets across Europe. And when it comes to cost, we are continuing to exercise the muscle we've built over recent years.Cost discipline remains well embedded in our organization, thanks to zero-based budgeting and we are extending efforts to cut other unnecessary costs from our supply chain, including reducing waste in our U.S. manufacturing network. As we head into the second half of the year, our new commercial organization is operating well.Our focus is more local and increasingly consumer-centric leading to improved speed, execution and results. By way of example in changing our organizational structure in Europe, we've made our business planning process much more efficient with 40% fewer meetings required. This has increased the speed of decision-making and keeps our people focused on their growth initiatives.On the next slide, I want to talk about another important pillar of our growth strategy, the acquisition of brands that help us accelerate growth by entering -- excuse me -- into adjacencies in broader snacking or into more well-being oriented products. So far this year, we've already made investments through our SnackFutures unit in the paleo/vegan chocolate company Hu and in the prebiotics company Uplift Foods.As you will have seen, we've recently taken a majority stake in Perfect Snacks, the pioneer in refrigerated nutrition bars. A few reasons why we are so excited about this brand. The products have great well-being credentials and offer organic non-GMO protein-rich snacks, which are on-trend with consumers. The company is growing fast and had 2018 revenues of $70 million.We will operate Perfect Snacks as a separate business in order to nurture its culture and its spirit. And importantly, key members of the founding family, the Keith are keeping a significant minority stake and will continue to lead the company. While they remain a separate business, we will offer significant resources to expand distribution. The business is delivering very strong growth and we're excited about the potential with clear opportunities to expand this platform further.Finally, let's turn to our impact on the world around us and our consumers. Our company's purpose to empower consumers to snack right is also reflected in our broad corporate sustainability agenda. In the second quarter, we announced our sustainable and mindful snacking goals.As part of our sustainable snacking strategy, for example, we have committed to sourcing 100% of the cocoa for our chocolate through Cocoa Life and moving to 100% recyclable packaging by 2025. And in order to encourage mindful consumption by our consumers, we will include portion amounts and mindful snacking information on all packages globally by 2025.We're also committed to cutting carbon dioxide emissions from the energy used in manufacturing. To help us achieve that, we announced a partnership with Enel Green Power to purchase energy delivered through the grid from a solar energy farm in the U.S. This will help us reduce our global manufacturing emissions by around 5%. The feedback on these initiatives from consumers and governments have been positive and underscores the importance for us to continue to lead the way in creating a future, where people and the planet thrive.With that, I will hand over to Luca. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Dirk, and good afternoon. As you can see on slide 11, we delivered strong performance across all our key metrics. The quarter includes broad-based revenue growth with balanced volume/mix and pricing, a solid increase in gross profit and high single EPS growth. Productivity and overhead savings provided the fuel for $50 million of business investments in the first half versus last year to drive sustainable growth. Finally, these good results translated into free cash flow of approximately $600 million year-to-date.Turning to slide 12. Our leading footprint in emerging markets remains a competitive advantage for us and help drive our strong topline growth in Q2. These markets grew approximately 8%, marking the fourth consecutive quarter of growth greater than 5%. Excluding inflation-driven growth in Argentina, emerging markets grew 5.4%.China, India, Southeast Asia, Russia and Mexico were among some of our business units that drove this growth with a nice balance of volume and price. Developed markets also posted good momentum in Q2 with nearly 3% organic net revenue growth, driven by strong results out of Europe and notable improvement in North America.Now let's review our profit performance on slide 13. In the second quarter, we increased gross profit by more than 4%. Productivity, volume leverage and pricing all contributed. And importantly, gross profit grew faster than revenues in three of four regions. We feel very good about our ability to convert additional volume and revenue into gross profit and investing this benefit to ignite a virtuous cycle.In Q2, this benefit was partially muted by some operational issues we've had in Brazil. I'll talk a bit more about those in a minute. Our gross profit increase translated into solid OI dollar expansion with volume leverage and cost savings offsetting a step up in investments in the areas of A&C route-to-market and innovation.Moving to regional performance on slide 14. Europe delivered an excellent quarter with 3.9% revenue growth, driven by strength in the U.K., Germany and Eastern Europe. Notably, strong in-store execution and marketing activations around Easter enabled a halo effect on our chocolate business and allowed us to exceed our sales expectations and gain market share while driving the category. Philadelphia also performed particularly well as our investments are driving growth.Adjusted OI dollars grew by 5% in Europe due to robust sales and volume leverage alongside ongoing cost discipline. We also invested in A&C and route-to-market in the quarter. AMEA grew 4.7% due to continued strength across much of the region. India delivered another quarter of double-digit growth fueled by strong market dynamics and great execution in both Chocolate and Biscuit.China grew double-digits driven by strong results in Biscuit. This includes a balance between global and local trends as both Oreo and Pacific delivered great results. Gum also had a standout quarter with strong growth as we continue to take share. South East Asia grew mid single-digits with solid results in Biscuits and Chocolate. AMEA increased operating income dollars by 5% due to operating gains, partially offset by additional investments in high-growth potential markets.Latin America grew 10.9% due in part to inflation-driven growth in Argentina and impact of lapping the trucker strike in Brazil last year. Growth excluding these items was low single-digits. Mexico delivered another mid single-digit increase driven by Graham. Adjusted OI dollars in Latin America declined by approximately 13%, primarily due to issues in Brazil during the quarter, surrounding the consolidation of four plants to two.Production delays and some service delivery issues impacted our gross profit. Our team in Brazil is working to address these issues and we expect improvements over the course of the second half, although there will be some headwinds also for Q3. Finally, North America grew 2.5% in Q2 led by solid results in the U.S. Biscuits business. We gained share in Biscuits as Oreo and belVita delivered strong results across multiple channels.We continue to improve service levels and in addition, our DSD execution is driving benefits. While we still have work to do to improve consistency, we are encouraged by this progress. The North American region grew OI by nearly 10% due to effective pricing, waste reduction and overall supply chain execution.Let me spend a moment on category highlights. Our three snacking categories continued to demonstrate great fundamentals with total category growth of 3.4% on a year-to-date basis. This builds off 2018 momentum and reinforces our confidence that we have shaped the portfolio in the right way to benefit from attractive categories and markets. We also know that in many cases, we have helped drive this category's strength through our investments and execution.A few examples include, U.S. Biscuits where Oreo and DSD are two key drivers or Easter execution around the world, but especially in the U.K. and Australia or in India where our distribution gains are helping chocolate to make its way into consumption habits throughout the country. Overall, we held or gained share in 65% of our business, which is an improvement over recent quarters.Our Biscuits business grew 3.6%. Approximately 70% of our revenue grew or held share in this category including our U.S., China and India business. In Chocolate, our business grew 6.6%. Approximately 65% of our revenue grew or held share including the U.K., Australia and Brazil. The execution around this season in many of our key chocolate countries was best-in-class. Gum & Candy revenue grew slightly. About 35% of our revenue in this business gained or held share including strength in China gum and Mexico candy.Now turning to EPS on slide 20. Q2 EPS grew 9%. This growth primarily reflected operating gains driven by strong revenue results as well as income from the JV equity investment and share repurchases. I'll now move on to our cash flow results on slide 21. We delivered year-to-date free cash flow of $581 million in line with our plans due to further working capital efficiencies. We are well positioned to deliver on our full year target.Turning to capital deployment on the next slide, we have returned $1.7 billion to our shareholders through the first half. Today, we announced an increase to our quarterly cash dividend of 10% consistent with our goal of dividend growth in excess of adjusted EPS.Moving to our outlook. We are increasing our full year organic net revenue growth expectations to 3% plus. This reflects our strong first half results, as well as our view that the fundamentals around our categories remain robust and that momentum will continue into the second half. But it also acknowledges that our year-to-date revenues, was positively affected by an exceptional execution in our Easter season. We are also increasing our outlook for EPS growth to approximately 5%.Let me spend a few words to explain some of the dynamics here. Our EPS delivery in the first half has been strong, but with respect to the second half, it is important to note that we lack two items. The first one is a tax favorability in Q3 last year related to the U.S. tax reform transition period. And the second is impact of lower tax rates in the Netherlands that benefited JDE in Q4 2018. Excluding these two items, our underlying profit performance should be comparable with the first half, where volume leverage upsides and gross profit increases will be partially reinvested in growth initiatives.Concerning our overall second half effective tax rate, it is important to note that it is expected to be in line with Q2. We are also updating our interest expense estimate to approximately $400 million. Additional geopolitical disruptions or other disruptive events including Brexit are not anticipated within this EPS outlook estimate. Finally, our free cash flow expectations are unchanged.With that, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Good afternoon, everyone. Just two questions from me. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, Andrew. Andrew Lazar : Good afternoon. First, I guess just at a high level Dirk, with the strong first half curious where you see this as putting Mondelez in the scheme of its broader strategy? I guess, do you see the company as ahead of schedule to return to the stated long-term algorithm? And then second, guidance for 3% plus organic top line for the full year. As you mentioned, Luca suggested deceleration from call it the 4% level in the first half. Are there some discrete items to think through here particularly given category growth is running above 3%? Or is there also perhaps some conservatism being employed as well? Thank you. Dirk Van de Put : Okay. Thanks for the question, Andrew. I will maybe reply to the first part and then Luca can take the second question. So yes, we are pleased with the performance in the first half. We feel that it's a confirmation of the strong fundamentals that we have, which as you see with our unique position as a global snacking leader, within the right categories, within the right geographies. We have the emerging markets, but also developed markets this quarter doing quite well. We feel that we are successfully executing against our strategy, which is good \u2013 giving good early results and share trends.We wanted to invest in our brands and our capability, which we are doing, and which we can probably increase a little bit for the year. And we know that that's not linear. Not all of the effects of that increased investment we will see this year. That's going to build up over time. And then, the whole change we want to drive in the company becoming more consumer-centric. We've changed our structure to business units, with a local-first approach changed the incentives all to improve speed and execution and results.And yes, I would say that, at this stage we feel that everything is going as planned and probably faster than we would have planned. And we feel that, the strategy we put in place and our execution against that strategy is positioning us in a situation where we think that creating sustainable long-term shareholder value is clear. And yeah, we feel pretty good about what's happening in the company at this stage. So maybe Luca, you can talk about the guidance? Luca Zaramella : Yeah. Thank you, Andrew. I think when you look at the quality of the overall results it is I think fair to say that, probably all around this is one of the best, if not the best quarter since the formation of Mondelez. And clearly, that gives us the confidence in the outlook also going forward. So we remain quite optimistic on the outlook and we clearly anticipate, continued momentum in the second half. We have to acknowledge though that the first half was positively impacted by what we call the halo effect on a great Easter execution.As we look around, all the countries where we have a meaningful chocolate business and there are many. We clearly drove the category performance in Q2. And we have executed very well from I would say supply chain with the exception of Brazil which we called out as one exception to actually being able to sell in the marketplace not only our seasonal products, but also the regular lines. And as we look at Easter, we are very, very pleased. We did exceptionally well. And that is one of the reasons why maybe the second part of the year might be lower than the 4% growth rate that you have seen in the first half. But to be very precise, we didn't have any discrete items in Q2 for that matter in the first half. Yes, we are lapping the trucker strike last year in Brazil, but in the big scheme of things it's quite immaterial. It is 0.1 points of growth for total Mondelez.You didn't ask about profit, but maybe I'll spend a couple of words there as well. Again, we are very pleased with what we saw on the first half. Excluding Brazil, gross profit is really growing nicely and we see the virtuous cycle coming to fruition. We see volume leverage coming through, productivity effective pricing. I mean, look at the number we are posting for North America profit as one example. And we are using the upside to reinvest in the business.The second half, as far as profit goes, it will be comparable to what we have seen so far. But we also want to solidify our business through continued investment.And so there is a little bit more to come in terms of investments. And clearly, where we see momentum, may be will double down to make sure that we generate even more revenue.So may be, we are conservative. But I would say the, first half was exceptionally well as we executed around for instance, these drivers I called out. Andrew Lazar : Okay. Thank you. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Andrew. Operator : Your next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Luca Zaramella : Hi, Bryan. Bryan Spillane : So two questions for me, one just -- first one, in North America pricing was up a little bit more sequentially in the second quarter, than it was in the first quarter. And I think you said in the prepared remarks, that you also had share gains.So, I guess two things around that. Relative to this price increase that you took earlier in the year or late last year, has the share performance. And the brands responded to that pricing. May be better than you expected?And I guess, as we are thinking about, kind of the balance of the year, would you expect that level of pricing to hold up the balance of the year? Luca Zaramella : Yeah. Maybe I'll start. And then, to give a little bit of more perspective on shares and brand dynamics, so I think that we led color -- a little bit of color there. So pricing, yes, it is sequentially better.And by the way, I think if you look across all the regions, it is a little bit sequentially better. So, it's not only a North American thing, I would say. But we announced price the second way, quite frankly, towards the end of last year and became partially into effect in Q1.So, it is kicking in, at its fullest in Q2. And that's why you see -- you see the benefit. Becoming a little bit more pronounced in Q2. As you said, the categories particularly in Biscuits are reacting well.When you dissect the category dynamics you see both, volume and pricing, being positive. And so, not really true that you can price and you're going to lose volume EPU.If you have good marketing bumbles. And f you support your franchises, that can lead to value and volume growth simultaneously, which is the case. And on top of that, we are driving share. Dirk Van de Put : Yeah. And may be to add to that on the shares, so, yes, we are seeing that our Biscuits category is in very good shape. North America, and as you know, it's 80% of our business.We have outstanding results for brands like Oreo or belVita, which means that we are driving the category growth. We see the pricing come through as Luca was commenting, and as we are gaining share.We also are seeing clearly that we have the benefit now of DSD. We have excellent execution in DSD in this quarter. And the other thing that has been changing is the retailer de-stocking is slowing down.So overall, we feel that there is good momentum in the consumer -- or in the consumption of our brands. And we feel that this momentum is going to continue. May be on North America, which has been a discussion in the past, a little bit on the supply chain because that could throw us off on those share gains that I was talking about.We saw a very good quarter. We are lowering our waste. Our case fill rate is back to a reasonable level. There's more work to be done. But overall, we feel that we really are seeing good progress there.We also have to improve our predictability and the consistency of the supply-chain. That has been one of the issues. But again, now for a number of quarters that has been improved.And we are also focused overall in driving excellence in our core operating processes. So, we don't see anything in the internal functioning of the company that would throw us off to continue to gain share in North America. Bryan Spillane : Okay, great. Thanks for that. And Luca, if I could just follow-up on, net interest expense. It's down for the year versus original. Is that a function of like refinancing or a movement in rates? Just trying to understand if there's more sensitivity to that, as we look forward? Luca Zaramella : No. I don't think. I mean you probably -- and some of your colleagues in Q1. Year-to-date we are $180 million give or take in terms of interest cost. So I think it is going to be in the ballpark of $400 million. So, I think it was a little bit more of we wanted to be on the safe side.I think in the meantime interest cost have moved down. And particularly given the commercial paper program, we have we are capturing some benefit versus the original guidance. So, I don't see anything material changing in the interest environment going forward.And we will continue to do what we had done so far, which is really getting our interest cost over the last five years down to a very good level, considering the investment grade we have. Bryan Spillane : Okay. Thank you. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Bryan. Operator : Your next question comes from Chris Growe with Stifel. Chris Growe : Hi. Good evening. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, good evening, Chris. Chris Growe : Hi. Thank you. I just had a question for you, first off on just the broader level of investment you're putting behind the business. And as we think about -- you gave some a good kind of forecast for the second half for profitability.And then unique factors to keep in mind, as you've outperformed, the first half are your investments even heavier the second half than they were in the first half, is the question?And then just to understand, how they're going emerging markets versus developed markets just to get a better sense of that please? Dirk Van de Put : Yeah. So, we are trying to get ourselves into this virtuous cycle, whereby, we invest more and that investment is concentrated in three areas. One is A&C, the second one is route-to-market and the third one is R&D.And as we invest more, we want that to generate volume growth, together with some pricing. And that then, increases our gross profit dollars of which we reinvest part of it. And the other part flows down to the bottom-line.In 2019, our thinking here is to largely reinvest most of that gross profit in the business. We obviously are going to deliver on the OI increase we have for the year. But it -- this is really a year of trying to get momentum in our brands and protect them for the long-term. So if we have the opportunity in the second half, yes, we are planning to invest more.I would also like to say that it's not just a question of investments. What we are also doing is trying to optimize our spending. What that means is that we are paying a lot of attention to our ROI on our investment activities. We've implemented a new, what we call marketing playbook, which is working well for us. And we are also shifting more of the investment to working media. So the net effect of what we really are spending on media and online is more than the extra amount we are investing. It's a shift within that spending too.So the long answer to your question is, yes, we will -- we see this year as an investment. We are still growing our OI, but we want to catch as much as momentum as we can on our brands. And so with what we're seeing coming out in the next second half, we expect that we can do a little bit more.As it relates to emerging markets versus developed markets, I'd say at a high level what is happening is that the very good trend that we've seen in the emerging markets, which was now for the fourth quarter in a row were growth of above 5% continued. They were up 7.6%. And we have very good results in places like India, China, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe.At this stage, we feel very good about these markets and we feel that we can continue to drive category development through increased distribution and more investment in the brands.Probably the biggest change came from developed markets versus the previous trend in this quarter, whereby, they now grew 2.8% almost 3%. That was driven, obviously, by the continued improvement in North America and a very strong Easter season in the U.K. and Ireland.So what I would say a good balance of volume and pricing was also clear for us in the developed markets and we expect -- we also saw as expanding our margins in those markets this quarter.So, overall, I would say very positive signs in both and nothing at this on the horizon that would throw us off except maybe from a Brexit or something like that. But we see the momentum in emerging and developed markets continuing. Chris Growe : Okay thank you for that answer. There was a lot of good color. I just had a quick follow-on, which is in relation to the pricing that you achieved this quarter, would you -- could we call that a full run rate based on what you announced so far? Or is there more pricing still to come through that you've announced in the market rather than focus on something you may still announce for the business? Luca Zaramella : Look I think Chris the -- I'm sensitive while talking about future pricing actions, and I don't want to signal anything. Just remember that we had some incremental pricing actions that took effect in the second part of last year. And in general terms what I would say is we have proven that we want to be disciplined in terms of pricing. Last year in the U.S., I think we were the first player to really move.So we will continue to be disciplined on pricing. We believe it is quintessential to the algorithm to support our franchises. So without talking about specifics, we see some places where there is inflation, where there is some commodity and cost pressures and we will take appropriate pricing actions as we see appropriate. Chris Growe : Okay. Thank you very much. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Chris. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Strycula with UBS. Steve Strycula : Hi good afternoon. So Luca to start off, I appreciate the color on Brazil. Was hoping to get a little bit more insight as to dimensionalizing how much of a profit drag it was to segment or total company profitability. And how do we think about the recovery rate in the back half? Specifically is this weighing on your ability to fill customer service rates? Is it causing any distribution losses in Brazil? Color there would be helpful. And then I have a quick follow-up for Dirk. Luca Zaramella : Yeah. So these operational issues in the quarter adversely impacted the gross profit line by I would say $20 million to $30 million. So it was a material impact. The simple facts are over the last couple of years at least Brazil has -- as an economy suffered quite a bit and the categories where we compete lost quite a bit of volume. So we really underwent a material change in the business. And we featured in the past Curitiba, which is one of the two plants. We have one in the south and the other one in the north as being very cost competitive.But the facts are we consolidated four plants down to these two plants and we had some executional issues. That translated first into inefficiencies in product that we had to scrap in the plant, but also in logistics related issues in terms of distribution inability to have the right product in the right place and also extra cost.The recovery rate, it is hard to give you a specific answer there. What I would say though is I don't think we would be fully solved by the end of Q3 and there might be improvements in Q4. I feel hopeful that there will be improvements in Q4, albeit I can't tell you exactly what they will be at this point in time.In the overall guidance we gave you, we consider all those things. And so we will provide an update clearly as we post Q3 and as we talk about Q4. But for the time being, I can't say that we would be fully solved by Q3 or Q4. Steve Strycula : Thanks. And then for Dirk, we've seen a lot of the global multinational companies that are also showing very good organic sales growth, reinvest also back into the core business. So to the extent you had the ability to pull forward some of the investment spend that you're planning for maybe the start of early fiscal 2020 into this year. What are some of the priority country-category combinations that we can look for the business to maybe improve or may be even accelerate at the margin? Thanks. Dirk Van de Put : Okay. Yes, I mean for us the emerging markets are very important. The reason being that we see that a lot of the snacking growth around the world will be coming from those markets. So for us to invest more in places like India, China, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe and also Brazil those are the places where we would think about.At the same time, we do feel that we have very good momentum in North America and we have not necessarily been able to invest a lot more versus the past in North America. So we are planning also there to increase our investment. So that's the way I would describe it. It's about the emerging markets the ones I mentioned and then North America. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Ken Goldman : Hi. Thank you. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, Kenneth. Luca Zaramella : Hi, Ken. Ken Goldman : It seems -- at least it's a possibility of a hard Brexit taking place at this point. And I know you've spoken in the past about some of the preparation you've done to maybe mitigate the impact. Can you just update us on some of the steps you've taken since where do you stand with that? And I imagine it's far too difficult to have any level of certainty here but if you are any closer to being able to quantify some of the risks of a Brexit that would be helpful too? Dirk Van de Put : Yes. Well, it's difficult to speculate. I can give you an indication of what we think the possible effects are of a Brexit, but to quantify that exactly is a little bit difficult since we do not know which shape or form Brexit will take.Having said that, the UK business is an important business for us. It's also one of our powerhouse businesses. It's a snacking powerhouse with a very strong presence in Chocolate, Biscuit and Candy. It's a market that is doing very well for us. It's very profitable and growing at a very good pace. And particularly this second quarter was a very good quarter for the UK.Like I said it's very difficult to speculate, but there's different forms of Brexit. And if there is a hard Brexit there will certainly be implications to our business. In the short-term, we are largely talking about supply-related issues. And in Q1 as we were preparing for a potential Brexit in March, we put in motion those plans.What does that mean? It means that we increased the level of raw materials we have in the country. We increased the number of warehousing space we have for finished products. We contract more distribution trucks and so we are ready to keep our products in distribution no matter what. We did that very well.In fact The TRADE called our preparation one of the best if not the best preparation for a potential Brexit and we are going to put that plan back in motion. We thought it would cover us very well on the short-term potential effects of disruption in the supply chain. However, there is also a risk that there could be inflation and a currency devaluation as a consequence of Brexit and those are effects that are much more difficult for us to estimate.And it would lead to a number of other changes that we needed to implement related to pricing, related to sourcing. Those are more of the longer-term effect. And as I said at this stage very difficult to exactly estimate what the quantitative effect will be.We are ready to deal with these challenges as you can imagine. We are running scenarios and we are ready to implement. We do believe that over the long-term this is a very strong market. It's a business that we want to protect and we are sure that if we have to deal with any short-term or even a little bit longer-term disruption that in the end we will be back stronger than before. As you might know we have a very significant production presence in the UK and we see ourselves capable in the end to supply the UK from the UK if need to. Ken Goldman : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey, good morning, folks. I guess, I'll real quick I'll just build off of Ken's question and I've got an entirely separate question. The UK government in March announced a temporary -- well some sort of proposal for temporary relief in the situation of a hard Brexit on import tariffs for up to 12 months. So that would appear to imply to most food products. Do you believe that would be applicable to your business? And could that be a powerful mitigator of any sort of near-term disruption? Luca Zaramella : Look we did quite an extensive analysis on these. We don't believe even after a temporary period there will be material tariff impacts in our business given the structure of our imports into the country. As Dirk said, we have a material presence in the UK to start with but also given what we bought and the shape and form of what we bought we don't believe there will be material ongoing tariff at this point in time based on what we know at this point.So I would say not only temporarily, but also in the long-term there will be most likely no material tariff impacts for us at this point in time. That's what we see. I think as Dirk said a hard Brexit will -- might hamper consumer confidence. There will be most likely an immediate currency devaluation on top of what we have seen these last couple of days. But we will also see potentially inflation running up into the countries and that might lead to a consumer situation. That might be detrimental not only to our business, but to the overall economy. So it's hard to say exactly what will happen, but that's really what we need to watch for. And that's how we want to take as a company a long-term stance making sure that we protect the business we have there which is quite a good business. Jason English : Sure. That makes a lot of sense. Thank you. And then pivoting to my second line of question it's really around gross margins. I understand the Brazil math. It looks like it was somewhere in the magnitude of 30 to 50 basis point drag on GMs this quarter. But the lack of margin flow-through on the accelerating price growth is nonetheless a little bit surprising. Can you walk us through the puts and takes like where is productivity coming in? Where is inflation? Where is the reinvestment in product or expansion into other lower-margin verticals that could mix down? What are all those puts and takes that are holding back GMs? Luca Zaramella : I would say -- and we are clearly not going to disclose gross margin or gross profit by region. But I can reassure you that, as I look at pretty much all P&Ls by category and business unit around the world, I can tell you that vast majority of those P&Ls make a lot of sense. You see broad-based growth and you see a nice balance of volume and pricing. The volume effect and the leverage that it provides to our supply chain is coming into effect and we see continued cost savings into costs and overheads.In some cases, clearly there are better outcomes than in others. But overall, I would say again as I look around the world, we are quite in a good place in terms of GP growth. I think on a year-to-date basis, we are 20 bps up in total company and again, when you add back the potential impact of Brazil and the fact that in terms of pure percentage margins places like Argentina are becoming a little bit more diluted than we have seen in the past.I think when you consider those two effects I think we can say we are quite pleased. You look at the OI growth in Q2 North America growing almost 10% OI. You look at EU and EMEA 5% after we made material investments in the A&C line. I think all-in-all, the algorithm as we envisaged in the first place is coming to fruition. It's not that we are not delivering the savings that volume leverage isn't there it is the fact that this specific quarter we had Latin America being an outlier. Jason English : Okay. Thank you. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Jason. Operator : Your next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. David Palmer : Thanks. Good evening. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, David. David Palmer : Two quick ones for me as well. First on Chocolate, your Chocolate business was holding or gaining share. I think it was about 35% to 40% of its markets last year. And now those numbers look more like two-thirds of that business are holding or gaining share, so that's a nice improvement. Could you talk about the biggest factors that have really turned your market share trends in Chocolate around? Luca Zaramella : Yes, yes. Well, we over-indexed in Easter and particularly in Europe. And so what you saw in the first quarter was that is kind of a normal trend in our business. Easter this year was not in the first quarter, but in the second quarter. Last year, it was in the first quarter. So you saw the difference. And in the second quarter, we had an excellent execution of Easter and that is really what is giving us the boost in the market share. So, we are now -- year-to-date we are sort of evened out and we saw some very good progress in our Chocolate market share. But it's completely due to our Easter execution. David Palmer : Got it. And then second you've talked in the past about a more decentralized management approach and that was going to dovetail with a greater attention to and perhaps spend behind some of your regional power brands not just your global ones. Is that -- or has that shift already begun? And is that a factor in your results this year? Or is that something more of a longer curve to it? Dirk Van de Put : No that shift has started. And so we've increased our overall investment and I would say a large chunk -- I can't put an exact percentage on it, but I would call it maybe 70%, 80% is going into those local brands. And we've seen a clear change of strength since we've started to do that. So local brands or regional brands in the past would have been negative for us. They're now positive and they have been accelerating every quarter in their growth. So the intention was there. We are executing and we're seeing the effects very, very clearly in our results. David Palmer : And do you think that that will be continuing to go -- an area of improvement even from these levels? Dirk Van de Put : I would expect that we still have some upside. At the moment, they are growing in line with or even slightly above the categories. But these are brands that have not received a lot of investments for years. If you take into account, we started about nine months ago really investing in them. So, we haven't even seen a full year of investment. And we're also not only increasing the investment, but we're doing a number of innovations launching a number of healthier products with cleaner ingredients and so on. So we are also renovating these brands. So, I do think that there's still a run way to increase the level of their growth. David Palmer : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow : Hi, thanks. Just wanted to clarify a couple of things, I think you said the second half you expected to be similar to the first. And were you referring to sales and operating income growth both because they're both running at around 4% ex currency? And then secondly, I'm still trying to figure out the level of investment or at least roughly. Your gross profit dollars ex currency are up 4.4% year-to-date. That's about $200 million. Is the answer something along the lines of half of that or some percentage of that? I know you don't want to give us an exact number, but I'm just trying to figure it out. Luca Zaramella : Yes. So when I said -- when I was talking about the profile being comparable I was talking more about gross profit and NOI. We gave you the couple of items that are masking a little bit the underlying performance of our EPS and they related as I said to taxes. So I was really referring to the bottom line more than the top line.What I said on the top line is that we clearly see momentum in the business. And we anticipate continued momentum in the second half both in terms of categories. And as one of your colleagues said, also in terms of share, we are quite pleased with what we saw in chocolate.But having said that, the first half was positively impacted by what we call the halo effect of a great Easter execution. And that is why the second part of the year might be lower than the 4% growth rate of the first half. As it relates to the level of investments, as we said, for the year, we intend to invest give or take $150 million. I think as you -- I gave you enough elements to say how the second part of the year will look like in terms of GP and NOI growth.And then we made the reference to what we spent in the first half. So there is more to come in the second half. But we will continue to invest both on global and local brands. We said we are investing in A&C. As Dirk said, it's not only the amount of money, it's the quality of what we are doing elevating, the emotional connections of our brands. But also in route-to-market or in route-to-market in places like India, Russia we continue to invest and we want to continue to invest.And finally in R&D, we are also making material investments specifically around test-and-learn methodologies, agile methodologies. We gave you a few examples of things we are doing. So I think you have enough elements to understand what we are -- how Q2 -- how Q3 and Q4 will look like in terms of GP and NOI. Robert Moskow : And just to be clear, the $150 million is the reinvestment for the total year or was that\u2026 Luca Zaramella : Yes it is. Yes it is. Robert Moskow : Thank you. Perfect. Luca Zaramella : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from David Driscoll with Citi Research. David Driscoll : Great. Thank you and good evening. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, David. David Driscoll : I appreciate you guys getting me in and I see what time we are on the hour. I guess just a couple of points. So first one is nice job on the first half of the year so far. And then I wanted to just ask a little bit about North America. The margin in the quarter I think just a little bit more than 22% segment margin. I believe that might be a record margin for North America. So given the problems that happened on the malware attack, et cetera, can you just take us up-to-date as to what really was the key driver for that margin? And would you expect that that margin has upside in the future as you continue your progression on cost in Lines of the Future, et cetera? Luca Zaramella : Look I think, if I have to step back and really tell you what is the difference in Q2 versus other quarters in North America, it is we have created a lot of discipline around key processes for the company. Starting with demand planning, making sure that we shape up demand in a way that makes sense in terms of cost. Instead of shipping products from branch-to-branch, we are governing through a better forecast, through a better governance all those flows of goods that in a context where we have more than 50 branches and quite a few SKUs in biscuits, governing that is clearly key.We have created a lot of discipline and visibility and transparency around waste and waste process not only what we generate in a plant, but also returns of goods. And I can tell you there is a material benefit coming through as Glen and the team have established processes to govern again waste.And third, but not less important, it is the fact that by having visibility and good understanding of how demand is shaping, our factories are able to predict more reliably what they need to produce and when. And so we have more efficient runs in the company.There is clearly also pricing coming through. In a context where last year we saw inflation, we priced promptly I believe. But the full benefit of pricing didn't come through last year, and so now you have a more balanced situation in terms of pricing net of cost. So these four elements are coming through.Do I think we can improve? Absolutely. I think we can improve. As we said, North America is one of the networks where we will be making more investments going forward. And so I think in terms of upside potential there is more to come. David Driscoll : That was a very thorough answer. One follow-on relating to outside North America, but relates to Chocolate. We've heard a number of U.S. chocolate companies taking price increases in the United States. You guys of course have in your major chocolate operations in Europe and elsewhere. Is -- can we draw any parallels between the price increases that we're seeing in the United States in chocolate where those price increases might be applicable to your chocolate operations outside the United States? Or would you really kind of disabuse me of that notion and say that these things are more unconnected than that? But it feels like North, North America and Europe should have some kind of connection in terms of chocolate pricing, would just love to hear your thought process? Luca Zaramella : Look again, it's really \u2013 it wouldn't be good for me to comment on future pricing actions in places like Europe. Again, that is too sensitive of a subject. I think there are a couple of things though that are very clear at this point in time. One, it is that, there is quite a bit of inflation not only in the U.S. but all around the world in terms of specifically two items. It's \u2013 one it is logistics costs, and the second one is labor costs. And so I think over time we have to make sure that we price that away. Might not happen in the short-term, but over time, we have proven that we have the discipline to price those costs away.The second part, I think it is very important to note that in terms of the way we procure cocoa, we are never hand-to-mouth. And this year for instance, cocoa prices went up for us, but we were able to secure cocoa at a very reasonable price. But I think it is fair to say that given some of the proposals that are coming out of the C\u00f4te d'ivoire and Ghana. There is a spike in cocoa cost. And concepts like the leading income differential are putting a little bit of pressure in the market. And the cost of cocoa has gone up. So I think I've given you enough elements for you to draw some conclusions. But for me to be able to talk about specific pricing actions, I think it is really hard. David Driscoll : Really appreciate the comments. Thank you, guys. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you. Luca Zaramella : Thank you. Operator : We have time for one more question. Your final question comes from Rob Dickerson with Deutsche Bank. Rob Dickerson : Great. Thank you filling me in. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, Rob. Luca Zaramella : Hey, how are you? Rob Dickerson : Couple of questions. I guess first question is just regarding the top line guidance you said potential implied slight deceleration, if that does happen in the back half versus kind of the floor of what we saw in the first half. The question I have though is it doesn't seem like pricing would necessarily be decelerating, just given the actions we are seeing flowing through in North America maybe Latin America as well. There's not much in Europe. But other parts of \u2013 or let's say Europe other kind of overall end market basis is still seeing decent pricing. And so then, I look at it and say well \u2013 okay, well then obviously, it will be more volume mix, and there could be some nuances to why. But like again, when I look in the first half, right, the first half the volume performance in growth terms volume/mix was essentially similar to what we saw in the first half of last year.And then \u2013 so if you look at the back half, the volume/mix is a little bit easier last year to compare again. So the question, even though wordy is basically, if there is deceleration it seems like kind of what you're saying is maybe there's a little risk of nuanced volume deceleration in the back half of the year, because the first half was impacted by a well-executed Easter. It doesn't seem like pricing would decelerate, but then that's off of an easier second half compare. So like why would volumes really decelerate that much, if the compare is easier? And if pricing isn't coming down why would organic sales really decelerate? Thanks. And I have one more. Luca Zaramella : Yeah. Look as we've said, I don't think this is about not having confidence in the second part of the year or seeing momentum slowing down or \u2013 as Andrew asked the first question having some discrete items in the first half that will turn into issues in the second part. This is nothing around all \u2013 any of these topics. Again, it is the recognition of the fact that in the 4.1%, we had on a year-to-date basis in the first half, there was a clear execution gain related to Easter.And that is why the second part of the year might be lower than the 4%, we see in the first half. But I think in the end, we have to feel good about the solidity of our categories the fact that the growth of the business is broad-based. Again, it is not about the quarter at 4.6% that I like. Obviously, I like the 4.6%. But it is the good quality of results all around. I haven't seen these types of volume/mix and price gains in a long, long time. I was very pleased with the share gains that we started seeing. Chocolate is fantastic. We are still losing a bit of share in places like India, where we have a 65% share. But if I take out India, all the big markets they are growing share. And the same is applicable to Biscuits. So this is not about saying the second part of the year, we will have a slowdown or it is about recognizing that in the first half, there was a positive impact due to Easter. Rob Dickerson : Okay. Fair enough. And then one other question \u2013 I have two questions. One is a little bit more sensitive. The first question is on just your JDE piece right total income from equity investments. In the first half year-over-year, it's up, say 30%. So obviously something is going well there. If you could just provide any color as to why they've been performing so well, one. And then two is that a run rate that we should be thinking about at least in the near term for the back half? And I asked just given it's obviously material to your total income. Luca Zaramella : Look, we are very pleased with coffee. It is fair to say that they have performed very, very well. So in Q2 and the first half, as you said, the earnings grew respectively 40% and 25%. As KDPs getting the synergies and this should be no surprise, we are reporting KDP on a lag. So to understand what is going to happen in Q3 for KDP, you have to look at their Q2. And JD is capitalizing on a successful business model in single-serve and espresso and compatible business, which is doing very, very well and it is taking share in the major markets in Europe mostly.The company is also generating good cash flow and they are delevering fast. And so, there is a subsequent interest cost saving. So, nothing has really changed in what we see in JDE and KDP. They are good financial investments for us. They doubled in value since the inception of the JV. And as we've said many times, there is more upside potential for both businesses and we like clearly the clarity, the vision, the potential and the flexibility those investments offer. Rob Dickerson : So, it doesn't sound like there's much urgency like say -- or any change to the strategic optionality thought process right? They're doing well. Obviously Q1 and Q2, they've done very well. Unless you really need the cash for some reason, let's just keep letting them do well. It's pretty much that? Luca Zaramella : Yeah. I mean we have good shareholder right over both companies. Specifically for JDE, we could propose a price to drop for which they have the right of first refusal. And then if the value is not accepted, we could take JD public through an IPO. And clearly, we would love to have a public mark for both investments as we believe there is more value. So, yeah, you're right. Nothing at this point has really changed. We see more upside potential for both companies. Rob Dickerson : Okay, super. And then one last quick one is just your -- when you said, back half profit would be similar to first half profit, means a lot of different things. And maybe I just don't get it. Sometimes I don't. Is that -- you're just -- you're literally just saying operating profit? Or is that gross profit? Or is that just net profit like net income would be similar on a dollar basis back half versus second half? That\u2019s it. Thanks. Luca Zaramella : Yeah. I think the shape of the P&L will be similar to the first half. I would say -- I would leave it at that. Clearly there is a little bit more investment coming in the second part of the year, but broad stroke the shape of the P&L is going to be similar. Rob Dickerson : Okay, super. Thank you so much. Luca Zaramella : Thank you. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you. And as I said at the outset, I'm proud of this quarter's results and of the work -- the hard work of my colleagues across the globe. I think this quarter and this first half show how our leadership position and strategy is helping to drive the strength of snacking categories around the world and creating value for our shareholders. And we do all this while remaining committed to deliver on our promise to create a future where people and the planet thrive.This first half helps us to remain focused on our long-term objective of generating volume-driven top line growth of 3% plus and fueled by virtuous circle of increasing investments, which generate solid sustainable operating income growth. Our progress to date gives me further confidence in the validity of our strategy and our long-term prospects. Thank you for your interest in the company. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Mondelez management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondelez. Please go ahead, sir. Shep Dunlap : Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO; and Luca Zaramella, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides, which are available on our Web site mondelezinternational.com/investors.During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.As we discuss our results today, unless otherwise noted, we will be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures, which adjust for certain items included in our GAAP results.

We'll close with Q&A.With that, I'll now turn the call over to Dirk. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you, Shep, and good afternoon everybody. We are pleased to report another quarter of strong top line growth, continuing the momentum of the first-half of the year. As you know, a year ago we launched our new strategy, which intended to accelerate our growth by focusing on the consumer, driving operational excellence, and building a winning growth culture. Today's results are proof that this strategy is working well, and that we're making progress against our goal to create attractive, long-term sustainable growth. So, let's take a look at the quarter in more detail.We reported revenue growth of 4.2% in the third quarter, which confirms the strength of our snacking fundamentals around the world, as well as the leadership role that our portfolio of global and local brands plays in snacking. The growth was high quality, and driven by a good balance of volume mix and pricing. It was also broad-based geographically. Our emerging markets grew 6.6% or 5% ex-Argentina, and we are encouraged by what we are seeing in markets such as Russia, India, China, as well as Southeast Asia. Our developed markets grew 2.9%. Europe reported strong volume-driven growth in key markets like Germany and the U.K. And in the U.S., we saw continued revenue growth and share gains, which was driven primarily by biscuits.Our strategy to invest more in our growth initiatives is paying off, resulting in solid operating income growth. Our adjusted EPS growth was 10% for the quarter, and we're also pleased with our year-to-date cash flow of $1.2 billion. As we look across our business units we're seeing evidence that our strategy is creating the basis for sustainable future growth. This is driven by a renewed focus on the consumer, which is informing everything we do, and it inspires and also motivates our teams. So while the entire organization is focused on driving top line growth, we remain true to our culture of cost discipline so that we can ensure that top line growth generates attractive OI dollar growth.This focus is leading to impactful growth initiatives across our business in key markets and key channels, as well as on our local and global brands. For instance, we're winning in growth channels in both developed and developing markets. In the U.S., this means capitalizing on growth opportunities like discount and club outlets. While in China we achieved new distribution milestones this quarter, we reached 1.5 million outlets with our biscuit products and one million outlets for our gum. And in ecommerce, another example, this means a continued global expansion through our partnerships with e-tailers and online platforms. Our reported growth in ecommerce for the quarter was 25%.Another area to highlight are our local jewels, local brands that are also contributing to our growth. A few examples that stood out in Q3 are the Jubilee biscuit brand in Russia, the iconic Prince Polo brand in Poland, and for instance, Biskuat in Indonesia. All these are performing well thanks to renewed investment and focus. A big priority for us this year has been to reinvigorate our marketing approach. One manifestation of that focus is what we call our new marketing playbook that gets to the root of what makes our brand special. Our intention is to drive clarity in brand positioning and consistency in execution. We've applied this playbook to many of our global brands, and we'll be rolling it out across more brands in the future.As a result of this renewed focus, we're seeing some good examples of brand equity campaigns that enhance our connection with consumers. In the U.K., for instance, where our growth was particularly strong this quarter, our latest edition of the Cadbury Dairy Milk Generosity campaign is performing really well. While we are driving growth, we remain very focused on our operational excellence. For instance, in marketing we've seen solid improvements in our return on investment in digital, while in our supply chain we continue to focus on productivity and process improvements. Good examples here would be the digitalization of our procurement function as well as the reduction of waste in our North American network.Around the world in our different business units, we are trying to reach best-in-class execution. In EMEA, for instance, we are leveraging our significant sales and distribution capability in key markets like India and Southeast Asia to win in seasonals. As an example, our seasonal gifting offerings performed well during the Hindu celebration of Rakhi in India, or as another example this year, Mid-Autumn mooncake season was particularly successful across Southeast Asia with Kinh Do and even Oreo-branded mooncakes selling really well. Local adaptations of our global brands or the success we're having with culturally relevant seasonal offerings underscore the power of our more locally oriented model.Another strong example of this is the work we are doing in China with our Stride gum brand. Here our approach is to personalize our marketing to Chinese consumers, and it is working well, helping us win with Gen Z consumers through mainly digital spend. Finally, we continue to make good progress with our more agile innovation approach and our SnackFutures initiative. Our focus is on emerging trends and technologies in wellbeing and premium products. As an example, we've recently reached an agreement with a key supplier to explore the use of cocoa fruit by introducing those parts of the fruit into the food chain that have thus far been discarded. A product using this ingredient was developed in record time and put into the market in a very limited distribution to see how it will perform.This sort of an approach is very different from the innovation approach that we had in the past. I'm also very proud of the progress we are continuing to make on our sustainable and mindful snacking strategies. Creating durable growth also means looking after our planet and the people who contribute and consume our products. This quarter, we were again recognized by the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, and improved our rating for environmental reporting. This is just one example of how we're brining to life our sustainable snacking strategy, which is our commitment to grow our business the right way.Another example is how we are using a new methodology focused on science-based targets to help us further reduce our end-to-end CO2 emissions. Finally, I want to mention the work we're doing to respond to the wellbeing needs of our consumers. We are working on offering the consumer the right snacks which can mean different things to different consumers. The options are ranging from smaller portion size formats, what you could call permissible indulgence, to better-for-you products which are made with authentic and simple ingredients or with a particular functional nutritional characteristic. A good proof point was our recent commitment in the U.K. to ensure that all our products that are made for parents to offer to their children are less than 100 calories per serving. I'm quite proud of this move, and know that we will have more to share in the future.And with that, I will hand it over to Luca. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you, Dirk, and good afternoon. As you can see on slide nine, we delivered strong performance across a number of key metrics. Our third quarter growth was notable for both its quality, which was broad-based, as well as for the balance of volume and pricing. During the quarter, we drove growth on a variety of fronts. We delivered strong results in three of four regions. Global brands grew mid single digits, while local brands continued to accelerate with growth in line with overall categories, and this growth was high quality, as it was driven by a balance of volume and pricing. Finally, this happened on the back of strong category growth, which we have driven.We also delivered solid increase in gross profit and OI dollars along with 10% EPS growth. Productivity and cost savings initiatives provided the fewer for approximately $85 million of business investments through the first three quarters. That was cleansing our brands, our go-to-market positions, and saves and marketing excellence for future years. Finally, Q3 marked another good quarter of free cash flow generation, which continues to be a key priority. We generated $1.2 billion through Q3, and are on target for a full-year outlook of $2.8 billion.Turning to slide 10, our scale, reach, and expertise in emerging markets are clear assets for our company. We continue to drive robust volume-driven grow in key countries like China, India, Southeast Asia, Russia, Mexico, and Africa. In aggregate, emerging markets grew approximately 7%, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of growth greater than 5%. Excluding inflation-driven growth in Argentina, emerging markets grew 5%. Developed markets also performed very well during the quarter with revenue growth of nearly 3% driven by strong volume-driven results out of Europe and North America, where we saw a combination of volume mix and pricing increases.Now, let's review our profitability performance on slide 11. In the third quarter, we increased gross profit by 2.6%, which in turn translated into solid OI dollar improvement with volume leverage, pricing, and cost savings, partially offsetting investments, primarily in route-to-market capabilities. It is important to note that our profitability results are consistent with our goal of higher quality and sustainable growth. When excluding Brazil, which is dealing with margin headwinds related to supply chain transition and powder beverage category weakness, our business is growing volume mix by more than 2%, growing gross profit dollars faster than revenues, enabling incremental investments across A&C and go-to-market, and growing operating income dollars faster than revenue on a year-to-date basis.Moving to regional performance on slide 12, Europe delivered another excellent quarter with 5% revenue growth. The U.K. was a standout with double-digit revenue growth in the quarter. Germany, Russia, and the rest of Eastern Europe also posted strong results. Europe continues to demonstrate sales and marketing excellence with particular strengths in our chocolate franchises, where all of our top brands deliver volume and revenue growth. Consistent with Q2, the Philadelphia business turn in very good results, driven by targeted investments, and great sales and marketing execution. Adjusted OI dollar grew by 6% in Europe due to robust sales and volume leverage, alongside ongoing investments, partially offset by higher A&C.AMEA grew 5.3%, showing continuous trends across much of the region. India grew double-digits behind strong execution, and an attractive market backdrop. We continue to perform well in chocolate, while building out a more meaningful biscuits business that represents a large opportunity for us. China grew just shy of 10%, driven by another well-executed quarter in both biscuit and gum. The team could show the power of our new local first commercial approach that empowers speed, agility, and consumer-centric decision-making. Southeast Asia grew mid-single digits with solid results in biscuits and chocolate. AMEA increased operating income dollars by 10% due to leverage from top line growth, partially offset by continued increases in investment in high growth potential markets.Latin America grew 4.3% due primarily to inflation-driven growth in Argentina. Revenue declined 1.5%, excluding Argentina. Mexico grew mid-single digits driven by strong execution in candy, while Brazil posted a decline, mostly due to softness in powder beverages driven by category decline and some share losses. We expect to see some volatility in this category in the coming quarters. Adjusted OI dollars in Latin America declined by approximately 13%, primarily due to volume losses in powder beverages, as well as the plant consolidation issues in Brazil that caused additional waste and logistical costs. We are continuing to work through these issues, and expect to see progress in Q4, though still somewhat wins on an absolute basis.Finally, North America grew 2.5% in Q3, led by another solid quarter in U.S. biscuits. We grew share in biscuits as Oreo, Ritz, and belVita, all delivered strong results. Improved commercial execution and innovation, share gains in alternative channels, and more consistency in supply chain help dye these results. We remain committed to sustaining our improved performance in the region. The North American region grew OI by almost 5% due to effective pricing and waste reduction with pricing and volume mix providing fuel for marketing investments.Let me spend a moment on categories highlights. Our three snacking categories continue to demonstrate some fundamentals, with total category growth of 4% on a year-to-date basis. We remain encouraged by the health of our categories, and believe they can continue to sustain growth of approximately 3% over the long-term. In many geographies, we were a key driver of the category growth. This includes areas such as U.S. and China biscuits, India, U.K., Russia, and Germany chocolate, and China gum. As we mentioned before, specifically chocolate is benefiting from a prolonged Easter season and the subsequent halo effect on overall consumption. These tailwinds accounts for almost one percentage points of overall category growth. Overall, we held or gain share in 65% of our business, which is consistent with our second quarter and evident of an improving trend over the past year. This resulted in overall flat shares for Mondelez.Our biscuits business grew 4.1%. Approximately 75% of our revenue grew or held share in this category, including our U.S., China, and India businesses. In chocolate, our business grew 6.4%, approximately 65% of our revenue grew or held share, including the U.K., Australia, and Russia. Gum and candy revenue grew slightly. About 35% of our revenue in this business gained or held share, including strengths in China, France, Brazil, and Russia gum.Now, turning to EPS on slide 18. Q3 EPS grew 10% in the quarter. This growth primarily reflected operating gains driven by strong revenue results income from the JV equity and the tax benefits in the quarter.I'll now move on to our free cash flow results on slide 19. We delivered year-to-date free cash flow of $1.2 billion, which is an improvement over the last years through Q3 due to continued progress in our cash conversion cycle, lower cash restructuring, and CapEx. We remain well-positioned to deliver on a full-year target, and feel good about our ability to make improvements over the coming years. I wanted to also mention that we continue to thoughtfully manage our balance sheet, and leverage, and cost of debt. In September, we raised approximately $2.5 billion in new financing at attractive rates to refinance debt matured in late October.Turning to capital deployment on the next slide, we have returned 2.3 billion to our shareholders through the first three quarters.Moving to our outlook, we are increasing our full-year organic net revenue growth expectations to 3.5% plus. This reflects our strong year-to-date results, which included the benefit of a longer Easter season. These dynamics do not extend into Q4, and as a result, we are not expecting Q4 growth at the same level as the first three quarters of the year.We are also increasing our outlook for adjusted EPS growth to 5% to 7%. As a reminder, in Q4 we expect to lap significant favorability in the equity income line related to our JDE investment due to the impact in Q4 of 2018 from an enacted tax rate reduction in the Netherlands. Please note that when estimating adjusted EPS we apply 5% to 7% outlook to the prior year basis of $2.42, then adjust for the expected impact of currency, which we anticipate to be circa $0.14. We expect underlying profit performance to be comparable with the profile so far, where volume leverage upsides and gross profit increases will be partially reinvested in growth initiatives. Additional geopolitical disruptions or other disruptive events, including the hard Brexit are not anticipated within this EPS outlook.We now expect to spend approximately $1.5 billion for the full-year on share repurchases as we acquire the perfect snack business, and then managing overall leverage thoughtfully. We repurchased a little over 200 million of shares in Q3 to bring our year-to-date amount to more than 1.1 billion, and continue to repurchase shares at current levels. We remain committed to returning meaningful capital to shareholders and share repurchases continue to be an important component of our capital return program. We will continue to operate with a disciplined approach which aims to optimize results for continuing shareholders and allows for flexibility based on market conditions. Finally, our free cash flow expectations remain unchanged.With that, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Good afternoon. Dirk Van de Put : Hi. Luca Zaramella : Hi, Andrew. Andrew Lazar : Hi, there. Two questions if I could. First, the updated full-year organic sales guidance of 3.5%-plus, as you mentioned, suggests perhaps a sequential deceleration in 4Q. Can you explain some of the puts and takes on that, particularly in light of the accelerated global category growth, I know you mentioned Easter, but wanted to know if there were some other things playing into that as well? And then second, Mondelez did discuss the challenges in Brazil on the supply chain last quarter. Feels like things maybe got a bit more challenging in 3Q. Could you talk about your visibility there, why you think you've got your arms around it, and perhaps you can parse out how much of the impact of third quarter was really supply chain versus some of the other headwinds in Brazil, like powdered beverages and such? Thanks very much. Dirk Van de Put : Okay. Well, maybe I'll start with looking at the top line, and then maybe Luca can discuss Brazil. The first thing I would like to say is that the strategy is working well. We are pleased with our progress. We see good momentum in the business; we are delivering on and above our goals. Everything we put in motion a year ago about consumer-centric organization and increasing our speed, execution, and results, it's all working out probably faster than we expected. And in this quarter we saw some quality net revenue growth and also year-to-date as it relates to volume mix and price. The mix between developed markets and emerging markets or between global and local brands as the balance is there.And the category is strong, as you pointed out, Andrew. In many cases it's driven by us since we play -- we're a major player in the categories. And yes, we do have some challenges in Latin America, but otherwise our overall performance from net revenue through gross profit into OI is a very healthy equation, and it shows that the top line growth we're having combined with the cost discipline is working out for us. We did call up our full-year outlook to 3.5%-plus net revenue growth and an EPS of 5% to 7%. That means that, yes, we expect that Q4 will be a little bit lower. I would say, as you pointed out, Andrew, the first thing to keep in mind is the longer Easter season that we have this year, which will have an effect or lessen -- no affect in Q4, if I can say it like that.In Q3, we also lapped the heat wave we had last year in Europe which was beneficial to us, so that had a benefit. And so in Q4 we will not see any of these benefits. And overall we feel that our categories are somewhere between 3% to 4% growth, not fully the 4% that we saw in Q4. And we think that the categories will go back to a normal growth rate of around 3%-plus as we've been seeing all the time in reality. As it relates to 2020, we continue to see big opportunities for us to keep on driving the categories to improve our market share and increasing our investment in our brands, in our capabilities, but we have to remain a little bit mindful again about Brexit, which didn't happen this year, but it will have an affect or potential on the first quarter. We'll give you a full outlook on 2020 when we report the Q4 earnings, but I would say, yes, that's the way we're looking at Q4 right now.So, Luca, may be a bit on Brazil. Luca Zaramella : Yes, let me maybe just start by saying that Brazil for us is a large and complex market. We have clearly a big portfolio in there that spans pretty much across all the categories that Mondelez competing globally. We have a good set of global and local brands. And as you say, entering Q3 we had a material negative impact that was anticipated for the most part, and this negative impact quite frankly explains the entirety of the profit shortfall that we had in LA in the quarter versus last year. As you said, the issues are two-fold. As we discussed in the last quarter, some plant closures caused transition issues. We ended up line startups that were delayed and we faced extra cost. We ended up scrapping more products than we wanted to. And in addition to that, we had some extra logistics cost. I would say this first issue accounts for pretty much half of the material profit gap we saw in the quarter in LA and in Brazil, as I said.And the second issue is about powdered beverages, which is a material category for us both in terms of top and bottom line. The category itself is quite challenged at the moment, and our shares of market are declining. The declining trend accelerated a bit in Q3 versus what we saw in the first part of the year. And that resulted in revenue and profit shortfalls, also compounded by the fact that in a declining category and share environment we had to take out some trade stock in the quarter. So we're working on both fronts. And we are making good progress and with our supply chain. But as we said very clearly in Q3, we will still have some impacts in Q4, but the issue should get materially better as we enter 2020.For PBs, the issue is a little bit more accentuated, and it will take some time for us to address both the category and the share decline dynamics. I would also like to take the opportunity that you provided with your question to reiterate a couple of things. Despite, as I said in my written remarks or recorded remarks, the materiality of the issues in Brazil, and the fact that we are lapping the highest gross margin in Q3 last year, our virtuous cycle is working. GP, NOI are both growing sort of 4% on a year-to-date basis. As I said, when you take out Brazil gross margins, NOI margins are both up on a year-to-date basis. We are delivering the volume leverage and SG&A leverage as we planned.We continue with cost discipline. I think you see in the quarter a good number for SG&A. That number includes an increase in A&C, but the embedded ZBB behaviors we have are delivering savings. And all of these quite frankly gives me confidence that the model is working, and that we will deliver on our long-term ambition to grow OI and GP more than revenue. So, not ideal what we saw in Brazil in the quarter, but in the big scheme of things when you strip it out I think the model is working and the long-term algorithm we have in mind is safeguarded. Operator : And your next question is from Chris Growe from Stifel. Chris Growe : Hi, good evening. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, Chris. Chris Growe : Hi. I just had a first kind of high level question. As you think about the strategy and executing your new strategy and your playbook for the business, I'm just curious how that's developing sequentially, so maybe not quarter-by-quarter, but just like, are you moving on to different types of investments, have you made a lot of the initial investment you wanted to make, is this moving more now to marketing new products? Just trying to get a sense of how that's playing into this stronger revenue growth barring some of the unique things that occurred this quarter? Dirk Van de Put : Yes. Maybe first of all it's a multiyear investment program. We are probably flowing less of our gross profit next year than this year into investments, but we want to keep on increasing our investment year-after-year. And this year, the investment was focused on an increase in our A&C, and increase in route-to-market investments, and to R&D, so innovation. So, Luca was talking about this virtuous cycle, which we want to continue. If I look at what that means for us going forward, I do not expect substantially these investments to change. We do have still areas of the world where we should be putting more and see investment in our brands, particularly the local brands which are accelerating, but they are yet not always on the right level of investment. We still have big route-to-market opportunities, if I think about China, India, where we have to go in third and fourth tier cities. And we for several years we want to be keep on investing, and you can imagine the same for places like Southeast Asia or Africa, where we need to keep on doing that.And then in R&D, we do want to continue to push on more agility and faster speed, and maybe a little bit less in the years to go forward than we did this year, but it's going to be largely the same three buckets that we are going to invest in. I would also say that apart from increasing our investment, we are also moving more of the investment within A&C into working media. And on top, we are trying to drive the ROI of our marketing spend. We've done things like consolidations of our agency, which drives value and gives us a more consistent quality globally, and we are also working quite hard on our point of sales execution investment, which we will continue next year. So, maybe a long answer to just point out where we are investing and the fact that we see that's continuing, it's working for us, and we feel that there's still a big upside in continuing to do so. Luca Zaramella : Yes, I -- Chris Growe : Go ahead, Luca. Luca Zaramella : I will comment for a second. All of this is contemplated in the mid single-digit guidance for OI growth that we gave you at Investor Day and the high single-digit EPS growth that again we gave you at Investor Day. Chris Growe : Going forward. Thank you, guys. Okay. And just one other question, if I could, which is the pricing is coming through this year, would you say that is offsetting cost inflation? So, if we think about pricing net of costs, your -- that's sort of not a factor on the gross margin here, is that the right way to look at that? Luca Zaramella : Yes, I think it is. I'm particularly pleased about the fact that our top line is in the quarter off volume enough pricing. I think it varies a little bit by region. Clearly, we see pricing more pronounced in emerging markets and in North America, where the inflationary pressure has been a little bit higher than in Europe. Europe growth is mostly driven by volume. I think you see AMEA with combined strong volume growth and pricing. I'm happy to report clearly that North America has returned to volume growth this quarter.So, overall, we really like the algorithm. It is more volume-driven in developed markets, where margins are higher, and emerging markets, in relative terms, we see a little bit less volume and more pricing which again we like. So, in the big scheme of things, it is quite balanced and it is offsetting the inflationary pressure. We see quite frankly, though, that is also because we covered our commodity and ForEx exposure quite well. So I don't want to hint to any pricing going into next year, but if we have to mark-to-market, our commodities and ForEx impact would be a little bit higher than what you see in the P&L at the moment. Chris Growe : Okay. Thank you for the color. That was helpful. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Chris. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you. Chris Growe : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Dirk Van de Put : Hi. Luca Zaramella : Hi. Dara Mohsenian : So first, just a clarification, Luca, on the Brazil issue, this just sounds like it'll linger in Q4, are you expecting a similar magnitude in Q4 relative to Q3, and then it's really next year when you start to see that drag dissipate? And then second, in the U.K., obviously very strong momentum in the quarter, double-digit revenue growth, can you give us a bit more detail on what drove that strength in terms of market share versus category growth? And some CPG companies have noticed a bit of slowdown around the Brexit uncertainty even though it didn't ultimately come to fruition this month. So, have you seen any impact there so far in Q4, expecting any deceleration going forward? Thanks. Luca Zaramella : Yes, maybe I'll comment on Brazil, a little bit on the U.K., and the impacts in here. So, on Brazil, the biggest impact that's been, you know, actual highest in both Q2 and Q3 that will still be an impact in Q4, but the impact will be substantially lower. Importantly, as we enter next year, the supply chain related issues should be fully solved or almost entirely sold. I think we will still see some issues related to powder beverages and competitiveness of Mondelez in that category. Remember in Q1, it is summertime, and so there is a big consumption. So, there might still be some PB, our powder beverage related issues in Q1.In U.K., I think we are quite frankly heating on all cylinders, the chocolate category is up, it is on the back of a hot summer last year, and the fact that Q3 was quite hot. So, there was a market de-cap, but importantly we're gaining share. Dirk alluded clearly to, or actually said that in Q3 the execution of Cadbury Dairy Milk and the campaign with Cadbury Dairy Milk Generosity is working very well, and we have seen material share gains. So, we are executing quite well around chocolate, but I would also say, around biscuits, which is the other good category. So, we are very pleased with the execution in that market. Dirk Van de Put : And I would add that at this stage we cannot talk about any slowdown as it relates to Brexit worries, as the numbers testified. So, we don't see -- at the moment we're preparing for it, of course, but we also believe that our categories, the snacking category is not necessarily going to go big swings up and down as consumer sentiment goes up and down. So, we hope that we will be a little bit protected from big consumer sentiment changes. Dara Mohsenian : Great. Thanks, guys. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ken Goldman with JP Morgan. Ken Goldman : Hey, good afternoon, everybody. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, Ken. Luca Zaramella : Hi, Ken. Ken Goldman : I wanted to -- I know you're not willing to talk about 2020 specifically yet, but you have bought Brexit a couple of times, and I just wanted to ask how you think about either including or excluding any potential impact from Brexit in your guidance, and some companies have said, \"You know what, there's no way we can quantify it. So, when we think about the out years, we're just not going to even try.\" And other companies who said, \"No, maybe we should bake in a little bit of risk into our guidance just in case.\" I am just trying to get a sense of where you guys are on that spectrum, if you even consider that yet? Dirk Van de Put : Yes, at a larger scale I would say you can say we are really in the first part where we cannot really quantify it, we don't know what type of Brexit it will be. And so, we have not included the larger effect of Brexit into our thinking, but we always include which we will also do for 2020 is the short-term Brexit disturbance that you could have at the borders, where we need to increase our inventories. We need to book more transportation. We need to stock up our raw materials and packaging, and so on. That we have always done, and that we will continue to do, and that's included in our forecast, but if we would be a hard for Brexit with a devaluation of the bounds and a big consumer reaction, that is not included for us. Ken Goldman : Thank you. And then follow-up is, at Andrew Lazar's conference recently, you talked about Oreo's distribution, not being good enough in U.S. C-stores. I always thought, and I think you guys have always thought, it's a pretty big opportunity that is not necessarily being capitalized on now, but I didn't get a sense of what moves you're making necessarily to improve Oreo in C-stores, whether you're going to use your DSD system to gain distribution and so forth. I just wanted to get a better sense of sort of what the strategy, and maybe some of the tactics are along those lines? Dirk Van de Put : Yes, first of all, I can say that in the background, there's a lot of work going on as it relates to Oreo in C-stores. It takes a while, we have to test our approach, see if it works. So, next year, we're expecting to make bigger strides as it relates to that. Just to clarify, our DSD does not work in the C-store channel. Obviously it's a system that works in the supermarket channel for us. So, we are not planning at this stage to use our DSD system for that, but we do have the right route-to-market setup, and we are building up the right programs and relationships with the clients, and we're expecting that next year we will show some significant progress. Luca Zaramella : And I think if you look at the market and share for C-stores, I think we are having not as high as the opportunities yet, but we are gaining sharing in C-stores in biscuits as well. Ken Goldman : Great, thank you. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Ken. Operator : Your next question comes from Steve Strycula with UBS. Steve Strycula : Hi, good afternoon. Luca Zaramella : Hi. Steve Strycula : So, Luca, a quick cleanup question on the gross margin, excluding Brazil, I think last quarter, you called it out as a $25 million to $30 million profit drag to the line, how should we think about the context specific to Q3? And then I have a revenue question follow-up? Luca Zaramella : I think it is round about the same number, it is in the ballpark. I think clearly one of the components as I called out it is in relation to PBs, powder beverages, and some de-stocking we had in that category. But when you look at all the numbers excluding Brazil, you really see that the shape of the P&L is good, and as I said, particularly on the year, now we're spending the fact that in Q3 will not be the highest gross margin last year, particularly on a year-to-date basis, you see that virtuous model predicated on volume growth coming into fruition. Steve Strycula : Great. And then, Dirk, can you walk us through some of the bigger chocolate markets, where Mondelez entered the last few years, but not necessarily has scaled pretty big into specifically China and the U.S.? What's your latest thinking about what the near, medium, and long-term opportunity is for both those markets? Thank you. Dirk Van de Put : Yes, so both markets are a little bit the same for us. We entered largely from what I would say as an opportunistic approach, trying to carve out as big a niche as we can. That would lead to a market share somewhere between 1%, 2%, may be 3%, best case. We were always aware of that. I would say now that both markets have very significant players here in the U.S. and in China that we would be up against. So, we didn't want to have sort of a major strategy or a major approach. We wanted to just capture the opportunity that we have, largely using Oreo as a brand. So far we have captured what we were planning to get, but we are not planning on pushing that into other brands or a major chocolate approach. We feel that we have other opportunities around the world, which are more -- which are biggest, and give us a better return, and we want to focus on both first before we want to enter those two big chocolate markets around the world, or increase our presence in those two big chocolate markets in China and U.S. Steve Strycula : Okay. Thank you. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you, Steve. Operator : Your next question is from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey, good evening, folks. Luca Zaramella : Hi, Jason. Jason English : Jeez, we've covered a lot of ground so far. So I always wanted to -- I guess I'll bring us back to that gross margin question to build off of Steve's prior question. I appreciate that you are up against a larger year-on-year comp, but just looking back over history, your gross margins aren't made meaningfully different between the second quarter and third quarter. Yet this quarter, they sequentially fell by around 90 bips, but it sounds like a fairly comparable Brazil supply chain issue. I'm not trying to make a mountain out of a molehill here, but can you just help us understand a little bit more what the drivers are of that sequential step-down? And how many of them are durable in nature, and which ones may dissipate with time? Luca Zaramella : Yes. I'm Luca. If you really look at percentages, I think on a year-to-date basis, we are under about 40%. I think we closed last year at 40.2%. So if we really want to dissect to the decimal points, yes, we are few decimal points behind. I don't think, Jason, there is anything structural besides Brazil. And Brazil again, as I dissect the issue, there is part of it that is going to persist to a certain extent into next year, and it is the powder beverage part of it. On supply chain, we should be fixed. I think as you look at all the components of the gross profit delivery, volume leverage is there. I think when you look at the volume mix that is 2%, that is a good number, I think that provides material leverage both into the GP line and the overhead line, and I think we see it coming into fruition.In terms of pricing, last year, we announced a couple of ways of pricing in the U.S. market, and I think as you look at the biscuit market specifically, you see volume and value going up. In that context, we are gaining share. I think in emerging markets, we clearly have the pricing discipline that is required. And quite frankly, it is a little bit more sophisticated than going out and announcing big price increases. It is leveraging the full array of pricing tools that we have, including previous optimization, promo intensity, price spec architecture, and as I answered before, if I look at the composition of the commodity and ForEx inflation, and the pricing, we have taken business unit by business unit, I think we did a good job in both emerging and developed markets. And productivity, it is a little bit lower than in the past years, not because gross productivity isn't there, it is there, but we are facing a little bit more inflation on the labor front and the logistics costs.So, as I dissect the gross margin components, and I take myself in a context where I say, \"Okay, Brazil is a little bit of an outlier. Do I see us having material issues on price net of commodities, productivity, volume leverage?\" The simple answer is \"No.\" I think the one point is mostly attributable to Brazil, it is attributable to the fact that in Q3 last year, the number was higher than the rest of the year, 40% with Brazil embedded into the number, I don't think it is for us something that we should worry structurally about. I think, having said that, we need to continue working well on delivering volume on getting the productivities and pricing in line with inflation we see in the marketplace. Jason English : Very well, thank you for the fair response. I appreciate it. I'll pass it on. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Jason. Operator : Your next question is from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. David Palmer : Thanks. Good evening. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, David. Luca Zaramella : Hi. David Palmer : Hi, Dirk. In the past, you've talked about that country level approach to management and one outcome would be that the local powder brands would be getting more marketing support, could you talk a little bit about that, and how's that going, are your country level managers spending more on those local brands as you had planned, and are you getting a return on that investment in terms of accelerated local brand growth? Any numbers on that would be helpful. And I have a quick follow-up. Dirk Van de Put : Yes. Well, the short answer to your question is, yes, they are spending more on the local brands, and yes, we're getting a return on that, and also, we're seeing an acceleration of the growth. So if I look at our local brands, for instance, in '18 they would have grown around 1%, year-to-date '19, they're growing about 3.5%, and they were even higher in Q3. So we clearly see the effect on our brands and we feel that we're getting a good return. Of course, we want those local brands to grow in line with the markets and they're about there, but there is still we feel the opportunity to keep on investing more. An example would be a brand like Pacific in China, which is very local brand, which is adapted to local flavors, biscuit brands, and it also has a health and wellness connotation. So that plays well, we're revamping LU in Belgium and France. And there's a number of these brands around the world which we think we need to really offer a full portfolio to our consumers. And again, to answer your question, clearly, yes, we have seen very clearly an effect on our local brands and it's working well. David Palmer : And related to that, I would have thought by now, there'd be more of those bolt-on takes like acquisitions around the world, beginning a wish list, as you get that country level approach, and they're seeing stuff that is more relevant for them in a country level, and then you'd be getting that wish list and would be building up by now and that inorganic growth would be becoming a bigger part of the story. Do you think that that could happen at some point that we start to see more and more bolt-ons as they look to add to the inventory of brands? Luca Zaramella : Yes, yes. We are constantly evaluating, I would say largely in our bigger markets, what are the opportunities for us to do bolt-on acquisitions. Of course in the first place, we want to invest in our own local brands. But if we see a clear gap in the market and sorting the snacking landscape as we lay it out, and the brands fits their like differences this with recent acquisition of Perfect Snacks here in U.S., protein bar refrigerated largely based on nuts. That is something we don't have growing very fast. So, as we see these opportunities around the world, we are clearly engaging, we try to be disciplined. And so we only will do it when it makes financial sense for us and on top, we see a large runway towards becoming a significant brand. We do not want to buy brands that in the end will not be of significant volume and net revenue to make a difference for us, but yes, again the answer would be yes. And hopefully in the coming quarter, we will see the effect of that. David Palmer : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Nik Modi with RBC. Nik Modi : Thanks. Good evening, everyone. Dirk Van de Put : Hi Nik. Nik Modi : Dirk, maybe hi, how are you? Maybe you could just answer two quick ones. The first is just latest thinking on DSD, just wanted to get your latest state of the Union on that. And then the second is, really talking about the breakfast occasion, as well as savory snacking and kind of how your initiatives in those areas are working and what we should be expecting, if you have any big opportunities over the next few quarters? Thanks. Dirk Van de Put : Okay. Maybe on the DSD, as we said in the past, we think DSD for us is a strength. It allows us to have a better customer service and a fuller presence, if I can call it like that in the store. And we've been very pleased with our performance of our DSD in U.S., and we've seen important market share gains and we're pushing the category. Obviously, the way we think about our DSD system is as we acquire some of these bolt-on brands, we're expecting to bring them over time onto our DSD system. And we've been testing that, we want to test very carefully and we do not want to do it overnight, but some of the tests we've been doing putting some of those new brands on our DSD system have been highly successful. And so as we go forward, you will start to see us putting things like campaigns on our DSD across the U.S., which will be a big boost to the test brand.So we remain very committed to DSD and we have a clear executional expectation of how DSD will perform for our current brands. But we also see a big opportunity to bring some of our new brands onto our DSD system. As it relates to the breakfast occasion, do you mind repeating what you were alluding to Nik because I didn't fully understand it? Nik Modi : Yes. I'm just trying to get a sense; obviously those are two important opportunities of growth for the company. So just wanted to understand what your - how those businesses performed this quarter and are there any big initiatives that we should be looking at for the next few quarters? Dirk Van de Put : Well, the brands that we are positioning on the breakfast occasion is belVita. BelVita is a biscuit that gives you a sort of a slow release of energy, gives you a four hour energy. It's a brand that's performing quite well and it's a mid-single digit growth at the moment, doing quite well particularly in the U.S. Our evolution for belVita is to offer it in more different forums going into a soft cake for instance, going potentially into bars and gradually expand the range of belVita to make it a fuller breakfast offering not only in U.S. but around the world and potentially also take the brand into mid-morning snacking, which could also be very interesting, and I think the brand has a credentials not only from a branding perspective, but also from the active ingredients to make that happen. That's really our focus for the breakfast occasion for us. Nik Modi : Excellent. Thank you. Okay. Operator : Your next question is from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow : Hi. Thank you. Dirk Van de Put : Hi. Robert Moskow : I just wanted to -- this year is characterized as one of reinvestment, so I think people are going to look at the SG&A decline as a percentage of sales as a sign that this quarter didn't get the reinvestment as you normally would give to the business, but then again, you've been very clear that ex-Brazil, there was a reinvestment and the model was working. So can you kind of confirm that this missteps in Brazil didn't result in any kind of lower spending elsewhere around the globe that you knew the profit was coming in weak in Brazil, but that maybe - you cut the spending a bit in Brazil, but not elsewhere. And then secondly, a question on powdered beverage is about $400 million in sales that was just my desk estimate here in Brazil. Dirk Van de Put : So, to your first part of the question, we didn't comp anywhere. Our PB expenses are up materially in Q3 actually more than only year-to-date basis. So, we protected the A&C investment, as these said many times there are a couple of things to bear in mind there. The first one is we are also skewing more towards working media. So that number that on the face of which is high in terms of total A&C is even higher in terms of working media and in the quarter and on a year-to-date basis. And the second element that has to be kept in mind is that management -- certainly management sitting at this table, but also management sitting in the business unit is not getting any past four A&C reductions in terms of incentive. So, if we deliver profit in a quarter through copying A&C, the number is not going count in terms of incentive that we're going to get at the end of the year, and I think that is an important step forward for the past, and the last thing we are going to do is copy and see even in a context where maybe -- we're under a little bit of pressure from a profit delivery.In Brazil, we did comp some A&C, but it was due to the fact that, we clearly didn't see it working. So, we are not going to be blind and say, yes, let's spend whatever, and no matter what, but I want to reassure that front, we're not going to do anything that we will regret in the medium to long-term. The PB categories in Brazil, it is north of $300 million. As I said, the category is a little bit challenged. We have big brands in there namely, Tang and Clight, and the local brand, which is called Fresh. We are facing a capital pressure point, one it is CSDs are taking share from the category, and the second element -- and so the category is shrinking a bit, and the second element is we are getting pressure from more competitive propositions and low price point propositions for consumers. So we are working on both and there is a more comprehensive plan we have in place for our beverages which hopefully will bring some positives, but I think it will take a little bit of time for that plan to really be in full effect and bring the capital back up and our share back up. Robert Moskow : Great, Thank you. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you. I think we can stop the questions here. We are at the top of the hour. So, to wrap it up, our third quarter results, particularly our top line performance demonstrates the continued strength of our core categories and the power of our unique local and global brand portfolio. Our new strategy focused on growth, execution and culture is continuing to drive engagement and results across our business units.We are encouraged by our early progress against our strategy. We're equally excited about the opportunities that we see ahead of us, particularly for next year, and to increase further the momentum for our company. We see that in the form of expansion into adjacencies, driving market share gains in our existing portfolio, or reinforcing the growth potential of our categories. Our focus going forward remains on continuing to execute against our strategy, and ensuring that the company is well-positioned for sustainable growth and attractive long-term shareholder value creation.Thank you for dialing in. Thank you for your interest in the company, and talk to you next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

Today\u2019s call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Mondelez management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President, Investor Relations of Mondelez. Please go ahead, sir. Shep Dunlap : Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO; and Luca Zaramella, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides which are available on our website, mondelezinternational.com/investors. During this call, we\u2019ll make forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K and 10-Q filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. As we discuss our results today, unless noted \u2013 as reported, we\u2019ll be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures, which adjust for certain items included in our GAAP results. In addition, we provide our year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis unless otherwise noted. You can find the comparable GAAP measures and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation. In today\u2019s call, Dirk will give you an overview of our results as well as a progress update against our strategic priorities. Then Luca will take you through the financials and our outlook. We\u2019ll close with Q&A. And with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Dirk. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you, Shep, and good afternoon, everybody. I will start off on Slide 4, called delivering long-term shareholder value creation. 2019 was a great year for Mondelez International. It was the first full year under our new consumer centric growth strategy. And we delivered strong results on the top and the bottom line, while generating significant free cash flow. Our solid execution and targeted investments in both our global and local brands enabled us to meet or exceed all of our financial targets for the year. These results give us increasing conviction that our strategy will create a sustained momentum in our business, allowing us to deliver on our long-term financial targets in the years to come. Switching to Slide 5, recapping the year, here are a few highlights. We delivered organic net revenue growth of 4.1%, which was broad based across geographies and brands, and was driven by both volume and pricing. In terms of geographies, emerging markets growth was strong, growing mid-single digit in ex-Argentina and driven primarily by key geographies like China, Russia and India, but also by emerging high growth markets in Southeast Asia. Developed markets showed robust growth with both Europe and North America performing well, delivering share gains and driving category growth. Overall, the results reflect the quality of our brand portfolio with our unique combination of both global and local brands benefiting from increased and targeted investments throughout the year. Our adjusted EPS growth was more than 8% for the year, and we are pleased with our full year free cash flow generation of about $3 billion, which was well ahead of our outlook. Switching to Slide 6, our strategy is now well embedded in the business. In the past 12 months, we\u2019ve made great strides in implementing it across the different business units. The rollout of the new strategy was reinforced by our new way of incentivizing our teams, assuring that everybody\u2019s clear on what is important. At its core, we are constantly trying to be more consumer centric using our new and unique understanding of consumers around the world to develop a more effective and a more consistent approach to marketing. And as a consequence, growth in our global brands has accelerated further, while our local brand growth is now very close to overall category growth. We\u2019ve also invested in further growth in non-grocery channels like discounters, e-commerce and convenience, as well as in expanding our distribution in fast-growing, developing markets like China, India and Russia. As it relates to innovation, we are becoming more agile and faster trying many new ideas, and in fact, rolling out fewer initiatives, but with bigger success. We are clear to that strategy only succeeds with outstanding execution. And while we still have a long way to go, I credit a big part of our results to better execution in our commercial as well as our supply chain operations. North America supply chain in 2019 definitely showed significant improvement. Our European teams executed against the seasonal opportunity like Easter and Christmas better than in recent years and our teams in India and China reached the highest level of execution in store as well as in the plants. However, the opportunity to constantly improve our execution remains significant, as our recent struggles with our supply chain in Brazil would indicate. As it relates to our operating costs while we are in the first place trying to leverage volume growth to a lower delivered cost per ton. We still see significant opportunity to optimize many other cost areas. While more and better marketing as well as strongly improved execution have driven our 2019 results, a shift in mindset around the company, also has had an important impact. The most important part of the shift was driven by our local first approach, basically empowering local business units to make the right choices for their consumers and their clients. This empowerment has led to clearer accountability and faster decision-making and was reinforced by focused incentives. I am proud of how the teams have embraced this new culture and really believe that this model has great potential for the future. While we are talking about culture, I\u2019d also like to mention a change in the leadership of our Latin American region. We are announcing today that Gustavo Valle will join us as Region President, Latin America, effective February 1st. Gustavo comes from Danone, where he\u2019s held numerous positions around the globe. In his last role, he was leading the global dairy and plant based division. Earlier in his career, he managed the Argentina and Brazilian business, and brings with him significant experience in the volatile economies of Latin America. I look forward to working with Gustavo again. Switching to Slide 7. While we are excited about our financial results and prospects in today\u2019s world, any consumer business needs to have as strong as social and environmental agenda as a financial agenda. Our own employees as well as our consumers demand it and customers, investors and other stakeholders expect it. So, I\u2019m happy to say that in 2019, we have made great progress in embedding our purpose to empower people to snack right. We announced the new sustainable snacking strategy with new goals and stronger commitments. In cocoa, our biggest commodity, we are committing to sourcing the equivalent of 100% of the cocoa we need for our chocolate brands through our Cocoa Life program by 2025. Today, I am proud to share that we\u2019ve achieved 63% by the end of 2019 and increased from 43% in 2018 and with a clear roadmap for the remainder. Earlier this year, we joined other major companies in renewing our commitment to the Paris climate accord and have set our path towards further reduction in carbon emissions. Looking towards the consumer, we\u2019re focused on making the packaging for all our products 100% recyclable by 2025. And by the end of 2019, we are already at 92% with some interesting trials underway to unlock the remaining 8% of that journey. Finally, as it relates to the mindful enjoyment of our products, we are committed to increasing our mix of portion controlled packs to 20% of our total revenues. We\u2019re well underway with 15% already sold in such formats. We know that our future growth and success as a company depends on ensuring people and planet thrive, and we are committed to tracking and reporting on our progress and impact transparently along the way. I look forward to sharing more with you in 2020. and with that, I will now hand it over to Luca. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Dirk and good afternoon. on the slide 9, is our financial performance for both quarter four and full year. We ended 2019 strongly, continuing the momentum were created since the beginning of our new strategic plan. This is the case as this relates to organic top-line growth that translated into earnings growth and free cash flow. We believe these outcomes to be high quality. revenue growth was broad-based by region, global and local brands and in terms of developed and emerging markets. As a matter of fact, 12 out of the 13 business units delivered growth in 2019. importantly, there was a good balance of volume and pricing, both of which are important. Volume allowing us to leverage the great infrastructure we have created with much work over the last few years and pricing to drive value. This balance results in top-line drove attractive profit dollar growth while enabling reinvestments in our brands. in Q4 and throughout 2019, we also made significant investments in area like Europe and AMEA to further support our brands and broader growth initiatives as well as in the biscuits category, North America and certain markets in Latin America. These investments were in line with our original plan and a bit higher in certain areas and delivered unexpected returns and share gains. Turning to slide 10. overall, we grew 4.1% in both Q4 and in 2019. We deliver strong volume and pricing led growth in virtually all key emerging markets like China, India, Southeast Asia, Russia, Mexico and Africa. In aggregate, emerging markets grew approximately 8% for both the year and the quarter. excluding inflation-driven growth in Argentina, emerging markets grew 6% for the year. These results support our conviction that our emerging market footprint is a competitive advantage and the investments we have been making in 2019 and previous years are paying off. Developed markets also delivered solid results for the year and quarter with revenue growth of approximately 2%, driven by improved results out of both Europe and North America. We share gains in both regions. as we said in previous calls, particularly in Europe, these results were aided by longer Easter season and the milder summer than 2018. now, let\u2019s review our profitability performance on slide 11. We increased gross profit by 4% for the full year and 4.4% in Q4. This gross profit dollar increase enabled a step-up in growth investments, focused on working media and route-to-market capabilities. We also drove solid OI dollar improvement with volume leverage, pricing and cost savings partially offset by growth investments. Moving to regional performance sounds like 12 for the full year. Europe executed very well for the year with 3.7% revenue growth. These results include strong volume-driven growth in developed markets such as the UK and Germany, which grew mid-single digit as well as Russia, which posted double-digit growth for the full year behind strong volumes and share gains. We deliver consistent execution in chocolate and seasonals throughout the year and the strong execution resulted both in share gains, particularly in our chocolate business and good category growth. Adjusted OI dollars grew by almost 6% in spite of significant investment in areas like A&C. EU shows the full potential of our mobile as we drove solid volume-driven market growth, gained share and delivered strong gross profit progression that allowed for A&C step-up. AMEA grew 5.3%, showing continuous trend across much of the region. India grew double-digit behind another year of strong execution and investment. We continue to help drive the chocolate market, while making progress against our work plans of building a larger biscuit platform. China grew high-single digits for the year driven by strength in both biscuits and gum and great execution in both e-commerce as well as the offline channels. Southeast Asia grew mid-single digit with solid results in biscuits and chocolate. EMEA increased operating income dollars by more than 9% due to leverage from top line growth. This growth comes despite some significant investments in A&C and route-to-market. The limited OI growth in Q4 is entirely due to additional investments in A&C. And those were enabled by continued strong gross profit growth that we saw throughout the whole year. Again, our algorithm is working quite well in this region. Latin America grew 7.8%, due primarily to inflation driven growth in Argentina. Revenue increased 1.7% excluding Argentina. Mexico grew mid-single-digit driven by strong execution and share growth across most categories. In Brazil, we saw slight decline in revenue driven primarily by a reduction of trade stocks in powdered beverages, partially offset by lapping the general truckers strike in 2018. We are beginning to take actions in this category including the launch of new marketing communications and product formulations. Adjusted OI dollars in Latin America declined by approximately 6%, primarily due to volume losses in powdered beverages in Brazil along with some remaining supply chain costs from our planned transition. We do not expect material planned transitional costs to continue in 2020. For the quarter, the significant growth in OI is due to lapping some one-timers related to Forex contracts settled in last year and some legal cases, while we are reassured by the solidity of the business in Mexico and the Western Indian region, and dealing well with the volatility of Argentina, we recognize there is more work to do in Brazil. And the focus of Gustavo and team will be mostly on that. Finally, North America grew 2.2% for the full year and more than 3% in Q4, driven by improved volumes. We closed the year well and delivered strong share results in biscuit, with growth in a number of key brands including Oreo, Ritz and belVita. We continue to make investments in A&C and we are seeing our brands respond favorably, mainly when coupled with our excellent DSD execution. The North American region grow more than 6% for the year due to leverage, effective pricing and waste reduction, with additional A&C mostly in our biscuits brands. North America had strong gross profits delivered throughout the year and Q4 was no exception to that, but again, levers of A&C stepped up in Q4. Turning to categories highlights. Our three snacking categories continued to demonstrate attractive growth. With total category growth of 3.6% for the year, we did see a more normalized growth in our categories for Q4 at 2.8% and some of the tailwinds that helped Q2 and Q3, and longer Easter in Q2 and the milder summer in both Q2 and Q3 subsided in the last part of the year. However, we remain encouraged by the health of our categories and believe they can continue to sustain growth of around 3% over the long-term and this is what our long-term algorithm is predicated upon. There are a number of very significant areas, where we have drive the category growth in 2019, among those U.S. biscuit, where we continued to execute better marketing and execution at point of sales and where we draw both value and volume growth through DSD. UK, India and Russia chocolate, where our renewed marketing bundles on both global and local brands capital, coupled with sales excellence drove substantial value for the category. Overall, we have or gained share in 75% of our business in 2019, which reflect the progress on our broader strategy of volume and share improvement. Overall, our share were up for the year in aggregate, ending several years of share losses. And we ended the year on an improved trajectory. By category, our biscuit business grew 4.4%. Approximately 75% of our revenue grew or held share in this category including our U.S., China, Russia and India businesses. In chocolate, our business grew 5.8%. Approximately 85% of our revenue grew or held share, including the U.K., Australia and Russia. Gum and candy revenue grew slightly. About 35% of our revenue in this business gained or held share including strength in China and France gum and Russia candy. Now turning to EPS on Slide 18. Full year EPS grew more than 8%. This growth primarily reflected operating gains driven by strong revenue results, income from JV equity stakes despite some tax wins in quarter, and lower than expected interest expense driven by accelerated cash flow, focused balance sheet management and favorable rate environment. I\u2019ll now move on to our free cash flow results on Slide 19. We delivered full year free cash flow of $3 billion, which was about our outlook and nearly $200 million improvement over last year due to strong income, continued progress in our cash conversion cycle as well as lower cash restructuring and CapEx. On Page 20, we returned $3 billion to our shareholders for the full-year. This brings us to more than $24 billion in capital return since Mondelez was formed. Now let me provide some details around our outlook for 2020. At the high level, we expect an our own algorithm year for 2020 in terms of our financial outlook. We expect organic net revenue growth of 3% plus. This is predicated on our view of category growth of approximately 3%, some share gains and revenue growth driven by both volume and pricing. We expect adjusted EPS in the high-single-digit range. This outlook implies continue growth of gross profit dollars and volume leverage. It also reflects another step-up in investments levels primarily in A&C and sales capabilities. To continue to support sustainable and high quality growth as well as some cost savings to fund incremental investments. With respect to free cash flow, we are expecting approximately $3 billion. They call this outlook includes additional cash tax impact resulting from the U.S. tax reform. In this outlook we also expect our 2020 adjusted effective tax rate to be in the low-to-mid-20s and interest expense of approximately $380 million. Although we do not provide a quarterly outlook on a key metrics, it is important to know that the following items in terms of phasing will impact 2020; both Easter and Chinese New Year for earlier this year when compared to 2019. In terms of year-over-year comparisons, our commodity pipeline is relatively more unfavorable in the first part of the year versus the second part of the year, especially in the first quarter and we have covered most of the key commodities for 2020. We also feel good about overall levels of pricing in the plan. With that, let\u2019s open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Good evening everybody. Dirk Van de Put : Hi Andrew. Luca Zaramella : Hi Andrew. Andrew Lazar : Hi. Just two for me. First, I\u2019d say obviously Mondelez had a much stronger than initially plan 2019 especially on organic sales growth. Company is looking for 3% plus in 2020, which is the long-term algorithm as you said, though obviously a deceleration from the 4% plus you showed in 2019. I was hoping you could talk a bit to this in terms of where or whether you\u2019re building in some conservatism there? Or if there\u2019s really something more specific behind it, whether it\u2019s, as you said, lapping a longer Easter and a hotter summer and things of that nature? And then I\u2019ve got a follow-up. Dirk Van de Put : Okay. Yes, I think 2019 was a good year for us. We\u2019ve just went through the numbers, not only because of the numbers, but I think also that it was sort of the first confirmation that our strategy\u2019s working. This was the first year, full year with the new strategy for us. We saw a number of signs that we think will continue next year, like the volume growth, like solid gross profit and OI dollar growth, market share gains, continue cost discipline. It was, as you alluded, helped by later Easter season, which gives us work time in store and also that we left the very hot summer of 2018 in Europe in 2019. So we can see now the markets in the last quarter, where the categories were more than 2.8%, not around the 4% that they were in the middle of the year. I think the unlock that we have, we will continue to work those out, put the consumer first, keep on focusing on our execution and keep on increasing our investments and keep on improving our marketing activating our local brand, so all of that will continue next year. And also what we have done as it relates to our responsibilities and goals and better alignment of our incentives, we\u2019re making a few more tweaks this year. And we have a number of issues that we need to solve, in the first place, Brazil supply chain, which is growing better, but also we have to pay attention to China for instance. So all that, for us we are saying the markets or the categories we think will be around 3%, we see ourselves increasing our market share, and so we call it the 3% plus in line with our long-term algorithm. And it\u2019s the beginning of the year, we are always very thoughtful as we set our targets and we\u2019ll see how the first quarter goes. But at this stage, we feel that it\u2019s certainly not in our book slow down from this year, we continue as we are, but we do believe that the categories will be a little bit less than they were last year, because of the reasons that I said. I think apart from the two watchouts that I mentioned, we see nothing at this stage that would particularly preoccupy us for the start of the year. So overall I would say, for us it\u2019s continued to strategy as we are. Yes, the numbers are a little bit less than they were in 2019, but that was largely driven by the structure of how things came about in 2019 and 2020 is a continuation of where we are. Andrew Lazar : Got it. Thanks very much. I\u2019ll leave it there. Dirk Van de Put : Okay. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Lane with BOA. Brian Lane : Hey, good afternoon, everyone. Dirk Van de Put : Hey, Brian. Luca Zaramella : Hey, Brian. Brian Lane : Hi. So I guess, I wanted to pick up just on the expectation for incremental investment for 2020, so maybe just a couple of points around that. First, if you can kind of maybe size what the incremental investment in 2020 would be relative to what it was in 2019. And then I guess is we\u2019re thinking about the sources of that, would we \u2013 would it sort of suggest that you\u2019d have gross profit, dollar growth growing faster than operating profit growth because there\u2019s going to be some incremental investment in A&C, or am I not thinking about that correctly? Dirk Van de Put : No, I think you\u2019re \u2013 well, it\u2019s \u2013 you\u2019re thinking about it correctly, but let me start from the start. And so in 2019, our extra investment was about $150 million, largely focused on more A&C route-to-market as R&D. And we\u2019re going to be in the same ballpark in 2020 as extra investment. In 2019, we had plans that extra investment would have an impact on earnings. I don\u2019t know if you remember, we said we would be sort of around mid-single digit earnings. But then during the year, our sales came in better as expected. We generated more gross profits. And in the end, we were ending the year on an 8% EPS increase. However, we had Brazil that affected us in a way. And in fact, our gross profit could have grown more and we would have hoped to invest more in 2019. So in 2020, the extra gross profit that we\u2019re adding is slightly higher than we did in 2019 in dollars. And we\u2019re flowing, let\u2019s say, 40% of that roughly into A&C and the other investment areas. So it\u2019s similar to what it was last year, but we don\u2019t have the negative effect of Brazil, and that\u2019s why we can continue with that algorithm and deliver high-single digit EPS growth. Brian Lane : That\u2019s helpful. And then just in terms of where geographically the spend is going to be, could you just maybe give us a little bit of color on kind of maybe where you emphasized the extra spend in 2019, and kind of where the incremental pieces going in 2020? And I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks. Dirk Van de Put : Yes. It goes largely to \u2013 first of all, the two sources or the two destinations of the money is one in extra marketing and media investment, to be very specific, it\u2019s all in media. And the second part is in distribution expansion. So the extra media investment is a little bit across the board. In most countries, it\u2019s different level that we do that, but the idea is to continue increasing our media pressure. As it relates to the route-to-market that is more concentrated in the emerging markets, the India\u2019s, the China\u2019s, the Russia\u2019s, where we still have a huge opportunity to increase our distribution. I would also like to add that, as it relates to those media investments, not only our rate increasing, the overall spend on A&C, but within that A&C we are shifting more into media. So we are increasing our working media spent largely through digital. And then also we constantly are trying to increase our ROI, which increased about 12% in 2019 on our media spend. So, and on top of that, we have restructured our agency. So we also think that our non-media spend will have higher efficiency and higher quality. So all that together, we have the effect of the higher investment, but also that re-shifting which has a pretty big effect on our media pressure. So that\u2019s a little bit how it all comes together. Brian Lane : That\u2019s great. Thank you for that color. Dirk Van de Put : Okay. Operator : We will take our next question from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey guys. Dirk Van de Put : Hi. Dara Mohsenian : Obviously some pretty strong results in terms of organic sales growth in 2019, but within that we saw a really solid acceleration in volume growth. So I\u2019d love to hear a bit of a state of the union now that the full year results are in, what drove that in your mind, how sustainable that volume of pickup is going forward? You mentioned both volume mix and pricing will be up next year, is one a bigger driver of that organic sales growth than the other. And then secondly on Brazil, have the supply chain issues \u2013 are those now been resolved and they\u2019re behind you? And maybe just give us a little more of an update on how you\u2019re managing the powdered beverage business, and if we should expect sequential improvement in the first half of the year versus the back half of last year, do those strategies take longer to play out? Thanks. Luca Zaramella : Okay. I\u2019ll start and maybe, Dirk will cover a little bit, Brazil. So, as to volume, clearly, we like what we have seen. We like that top-line growth is coming mostly through a good balance of both volume and pricing. We believe that balance is quite important, because it allows us to create value in the marketplace, but at the same time, to have the leverage that we need for our algorithm to really fully work. It is pretty much across the board, maybe looking at the numbers you might say it is a little bit less in emerging markets, but when you strip out Argentina, you really see a good balance of volume and pricing even in emerging markets. We keep on investing on our franchises, route-to-market in quality of our brands. And so we expect that to continue and we will always try to strike the right balance between pricing and volume. So, I don\u2019t think Q4 was a material exception through the rest of the year. I think the only one that came back in terms of volume growth in the second part of the year is North America. That is executing quite well behind biscuit, both in terms of marketing and I would say in terms of the execution. So, I think we will continue seeing that as we continue investing in our franchises. In Brazil, quite frankly, the supply chain issue is for the most part behind us, but there is more work to be done. And on PBs, I don\u2019t know, Dirk, if you want to comment a bit on \u2013 specifically on what we\u2019re doing and how we see that progressing in 2020? Dirk Van de Put : Yes. Yes. So, the PB market is starting to recuperate a little bit, but still not that great. And on top of that Tang, our brands, which was the leading brands was having some shared challenges. So what \u2013 and as a result of that, we saw some destocking of PBs in the trade, because there was less demand for it. So, what we\u2019re doing is, we are launching a new bundle on Tang, going a little bit back to what Tang was in the past. We had probably drifted a little bit too much into new variety, new flavor and so on, and more bringing it back to how Tang can really play a role in the daily beverage choice of kids in the family and how it contributes to that. We are increasing our investments. We\u2019re launching a new campaign. We\u2019re launching, of course, a number of new flavors, but overall, it\u2019s a bit too early to say what\u2019s going to happen. We are in the middle of the season of Brazil at the moment, but that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing on a powdered beverages. Luca Zaramella : In terms of comparison, the second part of the year will be easier in terms of top-line, because we started the destocking of PBs in the second part. So, I think that\u2019s maybe, the way you have to think about how it will phase out throughout the year. Dara Mohsenian : Great. Thanks guys. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Dara. Operator : Our next question is from John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. John Baumgartner : Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. Dirk Van de Put : Hi. Luca Zaramella : Hi. John Baumgartner : Dirk, I wanted to dig a little bit into the local brands. and I guess first off, could you maybe, ballpark what percentage of the revenue base there, it\u2019s already been activated with the increased investments and of the brands that have not been activated, how are you thinking about the phasing of the investment uptick between 2020, maybe 2021 at this point? Dirk Van de Put : Yes. so, the local brands, I would roughly say about 45% of our portfolio is global brands, about 45% is local brands that we want to activate. And then about 10% is a brand that we do not want to activate and largely run there for cash. Of those local brands, those 45%, most of them have been activated; I wouldn\u2019t say yet with the optimal media spend yet. So that\u2019s where we want to increase it. But the ones that we have been able to increase media and reposition them and give them sort of a new purpose that has worked really well for us. So, one of the most striking examples would be Jubilee in Russia, which is a legacy biscuit brand, which was kind of dormant and we\u2019ve revamped it, and it\u2019s now showing double-digit growth and a strong market share increase. And we see that with a number of brands, LU in Europe, and we see that with a number of brands around the world. So, I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s \u2013 within that 45%, that part was not activated than other parts was activated now. But overall, the local brands are growing 3.2% versus the global brands, but the local brands are now getting very close to category growth and we really want them to be in line with category growth and global brands clearly need to be above that, that\u2019s the way we think about it. John Baumgartner : Okay. And then just to follow up on that, where you had increased the investment in those local brands, I\u2019m curious how your competitors are responding. Are you seeing them generally staying rationale in terms of pricing and kind of following your lead, doubling down on marketing and innovation of their own? Just where are the observations there so far in terms of the competitive dynamics? Dirk Van de Put : Well, we tried to avoid to run price promotions and so on, on the local brands. So, the reaction there has been, I mean, I wouldn\u2019t say, within in a price war as I think about it around the world. Yes. as we move some of these local brands and sometimes we move them more into the sustainability direction and things like that, yes, there is a reaction of competition trying to do the same. But I think overall, that\u2019s very good for the category, because that will help the consumer increase its interest in our category. So, we\u2019re not against it, I think it\u2019s a good movement overall. John Baumgartner : Great. Thank you for your time. Dirk Van de Put : Okay. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Growe with Stifel. Chris Growe : Hi, good evening. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, Chris. Luca Zaramella : Hi, Chris. Chris Growe : Hi. I just had a question if I could ask first, and I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve addressed it yet. but just, I\u2019m curious what rate of inflation you expect for this year and then related to that, you\u2019ve talked about some pricing, you have some cost savings coming through. Is it pricing that mostly offsets cost inflation for the year or will you need some \u2013 maybe, your simplified growth savings offset some of that as well? Luca Zaramella : So, I think when you look at the last couple of years, we have seen quite a bit of inflation pressure, mostly around I would say transportation costs, labor costs, and I would add Forex to that, clearly with the dollar strengthening, there was a big inflation component that touched to that. Commodities were a little bit more favorable than the last five years, over the last couple of years I would say, as we move forward, we see a little bit more normal inflation pressure around labor and clearly, there are differences around the world, there are economies like India, where labor inflation is quite high; but overall for the company it is a little bit lower in that area. But clearly, we see a little bit more of a commodity-driven inflation, particularly around cocoa, dairy is another one, and packaging costs as well. So all in all, we expect commodities, forex and inflation to be in 2020 in the ballpark of what we have seen in 2019. And so we expect obviously to price that away. In the short-term, I think we do as a company a good job in putting in place good coverage strategy. And so we are never hand-to-mouth in terms of some of these commodities or even some packaging inflation can be covered well through those instruments. And so in the short-term, we will always try to strike the best balance between our volume, our pricing and our inflation. In the long-term or in the medium-term, we really want to price it away. I can\u2019t give you the exact number in terms of pricing. We don\u2019t guide to a breakdown between, what we say in terms of revenue and volume and pricing. But I think it is fair to say I don\u2019t see dynamics changing dramatically into 2020. What we\u2019re doing in terms of productivity and cost saving initiatives, reality is what we would like to do is for that money to be half reinvested back into the business and fund A&C and route-to-market investments, and there has to be dropped to the bottom line. So that\u2019s the way we think. We see productivity and cost saving initiatives to be the real upside to margin and stepped up investments. Chris Growe : Okay. Thank you for that. And I have just one other quick question, which would be and I think that \u2013 I think that gets classified under the route-to-market investments, but you\u2019ve had an expansion of distribution in some of the faster growth channels. You\u2019ve talked about the U.S., the club stores and discount stores. I think that\u2019s also occurring in the emerging market. Just curious, is that an incremental investment level for you? Is that costing more than part of your investment in 2020 as well? And should we see that be a contributor to revenue growth? Dirk Van de Put : Yes. We are \u2013 if I would summarize what we did in 2019, which we are largely repeating in 2020, maybe, even increasing a little bit in the developed markets that would be particularly around seasonals that we tried to have a better and stronger in store presence. And then also going into the \u2013 what we call the alternative growth channels in U.S. that would be convenient for instance, and put a bit more manpower, a bit more investment in there \u2013 in the emerging markets, it largely has to see with physical distribution opening more distribution centers, having more trucks on the road, putting more coolers in the stores in India; but also in China for instance, it means going into third tier cities, setting up sales teams there and starting to cover these cities. So for instance, in China, we\u2019ve added about 140,000 new stores this year and we are planning to continue that into the 2020. So, it does help our revenue clearly, I mean we\u2019ve seen a well above category growth in China and we are seeing very strong double-digit growth in India. And we are counting that our distribution expansion is helping us. and at the same time in the developed markets, we want to continue that shift into more seasonals and more alternative growth channels, which also will help our revenue growth. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Steve Strycula with UBS. Steve Strycula : Hi, good afternoon. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, Steve. Steve Strycula : Good, Dirk. A quick question for you to kick off. As you think about the outlook for 2020 in your guidance for 3% plus growth. How should we think about how you evaluated macro considerations, whether it be \u2013 what\u2019s kind of unfolding in front of us in China right now, or even with some of the other multinational companies has cited with macro softness in select countries across South America. I know that you\u2019ve called out discrete issues for the powdered beverage category, but love to hear your view on those two macro situations and have a quick follow-up for Luca. Dirk Van de Put : Okay. So, if I start with maybe, the developed markets, if we see a little bit of a pullback in developed markets, which we don\u2019t see at the moment, to be honest, we see some very vibrant growth in Europe and in the U.S. So, it\u2019s clearly not visible for us, but I would say, our snacking categories are a little bit more resilient if there would be a pullback in the economy than other FMCG categories. Trade tensions between the U.S. and others are really not currently impacting us. Brexit, I would say is a risk, although I don\u2019t see it in 2020, but if there would be no deal near the end of the year, that would be possibly a disruptor. But we \u2013 I assume at this stage that we\u2019ll find the deal and that it will be a relatively smooth transition. in the emerging markets and I know that some of our colleagues are seeing different impacts there. We are not feeling an impact in India or in China, but we would probably be a bit more cautious around the projections for Latin America. Obviously, we have high inflationary environment in Argentina, which we are largely managing to protect our scale and our absolute profit generation as well as our cash flow in the country. And we do know and we see it of course, that there is more volatility in emerging markets, but we feel that the growth opportunities far outweigh the risks of that. You have to also take into account that snacking behavior and snacking demand is still growing very fast in these markets and there\u2019s still a lot of runway there. And then I would overall say that our categories are showing an acceleration into 2019. We are forecasting them at 3%, which is our long-term expectation for our categories. We don\u2019t see that at the moment as being risk, because we believe that there is still a lot of opportunity for consumers to keep on snacking more. And for instance, our study we recently did about the state of snacking clearly showed that the behavior is on the uptick. So overall, I would say we cannot confirm some of the other impressions that you\u2019ve heard from some of our colleagues. We feel pretty good about what we\u2019re seeing around the world. Steve Strycula : Thanks. Very helpful. And then quick question for Luca. Did I miss in your prepared remarks for fiscal 2020 guidance, what the EBIT dollar outlook would be on a constant currency basis to kind of get to the algorithm you\u2019re on EPS? Luca Zaramella : Look, we purposely didn\u2019t go there necessarily. We gave you enough elements; I think we have commented a bit on what type of gross profit growth it sees for the year. Obviously, we expect gross profit to be the source of funding for A&C and route-to-market. The long-term algorithm implies a strong mid single-digit OI growth. And again, I think in 2020, if you do the math, we should be around about there. We believe, in the end, the way we are running the business, which is we want to have volume growth. We want to have a shared gain, simplifying a category growth that is projected and exiting the last year, it was 2.8%, so around about three. I think that gives us together with cost savings and investments in the business, the ability for us, by not even counting much on below the OI or the EBIT line items gives us the ability to achieve the high-single digit EPS that is part of the guidance we gave for 2020. And importantly, the $3 billion plus of free cash flow that is our long-term guidance for cash. Dirk Van de Put : Steve, just before we switch to the next question. Did your question also consider the Coronavirus in China? Was that, because I largely talked about the economies that we see around the world, but maybe it\u2019s also good that I comment a little bit on China and the Coronavirus situation for us. So, quickly China is about $1 billion net revenue country for us, so about 4.5%. We had a very strong 2019 and it contributed to our growth. We do believe there will be an impact on our Q1 revenue, but it\u2019s really too early to quantify for us at this point. We are monitoring the situation closely and we\u2019ll update you, if in case there is something that we need to report. The outbreak has come during Chinese New Year, which is a time of high consumption. Our sell-in was in line with expectations, was quite good. We now have to see in the coming weeks what has happened with the sell-out during Chinese New Year. The other thing that is happening is that, normally today our factories, we have four factories in China, two of our factories, they are in a region where we normally would have started up our factories again. The government \u2013 the local government has asked to keep our factories closed for another 10 year \u2013 sorry, it\u2019s 10 days, in order to not have too much of a risk with the infection. And we also have voluntarily put some travel restrictions to our own people to travel less within China and also for our global people to travel less to China. But overall, I would like to point out that we do believe that this could have a short-term impact, but long-term we continue to be very convinced for the outlook of the Chinese market for us. Steve Strycula : Great. Thank you. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Steve. Operator : Our next question is from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey folks, thanks for squeezing me in, much appreciate it. And happy belated New Year. Luca Zaramella : Hi. Jason English : Two things for me, for first, congrats on a row \u2013 on a solid year, it\u2019s great to see the momentum, particularly on your core business, biscuits and chocolate performing quite nicely. The gum and confection side though continues to relinquish on market share side. Can you touch on what, if any plans you have to resuscitate that business? So that\u2019s question one. And then second question, in the context of overall, the business is doing pretty solid with the portfolio you have. Can you also then touch on your strategic ambitions? As we think about M&A and some of the investments that you have out there, the potential to monetize and the potential to reallocate some of those to build your portfolio in new areas. Just update us on your broader thought process on strategic direction. Thank you. Dirk Van de Put : Okay, well. Maybe I\u2019ll talk about gum and candy, and Luca, can talk a little bit about our M&A and strategic investment. So there is a clear distinction this year in 2019 between gum and candy. On gum, what has changed or not changed is the fact that we are doing very well in emerging markets, where we are gaining shares in our gum business. We have year-to-date very good revenue growth, we gained shares particularly in China, which is our second biggest gum market in the world and in Brazil we are gaining share. It is clearly not the strongest category in those markets, but it is positive growth for the category and positive share for us in emerging markets. We continue to be challenged in developed markets. Largely in the U.S., Europe is in a \u2013 we\u2019re clearly seeing a better situation, but it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s the U.S. that continues to be very difficult for us. The category is displaying now low growth, but it\u2019s growing, but we are still losing some share. And we have some fundamental category challenges and we have some brand challenges. I would say that, on our major brand Trident, things are quite okay. It\u2019s in the smaller brands, which we are gradually, I would say, flush out of the system, that\u2019s what is causing this continued share loss for us. As it relates to candy, I would say, the reason why candy was not as vibrant this year was largely due to the U.S. market where we had capacity issue. That capacity issue is now solved and we expect a much better 2020 for our candy business in the U.S. I would say that as we look at the future plans for gum, it\u2019s a difficult situation for us, because gum is very profitable and gives a scale in key markets. So it\u2019s not something that we can just sort of shift the side. We are working on a number of initiatives to address that share decline. First of all, as I said strengthening our core brands like Stride in China or Trident in the U.S., improving quality, changing the positioning, improving the positioning, we are doing expansion into means that of course doesn\u2019t solve our gum problem, but that does reinforce the brand. And we are having very good results with that, in for instance, France, with Hollywood. And then we have started to launch a number of new experiences, new reasons to chew, particularly in Brazil and we are also seeing some very good traction on that. So we have the first sort of test and learn as it relates to renew the initiatives on gum and we have to see how they\u2019ll span-out in 2020. So maybe Luca you can talk about the M&A. Luca Zaramella : Yes. May be let\u2019s start with the coffee and I will start by saying that the JVs are performing well and are very attractive, but at this point in time, in terms of what we have always described as a financial investment and so there would be a point in time where we will exit those investments. They are good investments. They continue to perform quite strongly. We had a good earnings growth related to them in 2019 and we are expecting solid earnings throughout into 2020. The category itself continue to be attractive. I think in the past we commented a bit into, you know how much we would welcome an IPO of JDE. I think that would establish a public mark for that investment. We believe that eventually will improve our value over all as Mondelez as it is a good asset. And I think it will allow you guys to do a proper some of the part analysis for Mondelez by a way of \u2013 a subway or for that. I would say also that JDE is truly a great company, still quite a bit of untapped potential, it\u2019s a compelling growth story as a company and it is a little bit more than, than roster ground. I think it is a company that has a big presence in premium segments through what we call instant coffee and on-demand as well as a professional presence in terms of, away from home and servicing other occasions than in Hong Kong. So I\u2019m just \u2013 we feel quite good about those. Having said that, the timing of the exit as we always said will depend upon how much potential we still see in those companies and an appropriate use of funds which potentially is better M&A and assets that we like in the snacking landscape globally. We will remain disciplined in terms of M&A and we have discussed that our preference at this point in time is on both times. We are looking at premium wellbeing areas, adjacencies and trying to fill some of the portfolio gaps we have both geographically and category wise in some places around the world. So we believe that by staying disciplined, we will have the ability to fill some of these gaps and step up even more \u2013 our growth rate on the top line and on earnings as well. Jason English : Great. Thank you so much. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you, Jason. Operator : We take our final question from Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Ken Zaslow : Good afternoon everyone. I just have two quick questions. One is on the investment, at what point do they become self funding? I know they\u2019ve had good returns, but how do you think about the years in which they will just kind of be a virtuous cycle? And the second question I have is in Europe, what has the utilization rates been in the facilities and where are they now and where they look to be visit. It seems like that\u2019s part of the opportunity that you guys continue to leverage over time as you get more volume through it as operating leverage? And I\u2019ll leave it with those two. Dirk Van de Put : Okay. Maybe I\u2019ll talk about the investments and then Luca can talk about the operating leverage. Luca Zaramella : Yes. Dirk Van de Put : So when the investments become self funding, I think it\u2019s still a little bit of way for us. We feel that we have potential to drive the categories around the world and we see good reaction, good return on investment still. And so as we are trying to develop a long-term algorithm that is repeatable year-after-year. at this stage, it feels that the algorithm allows us to keep on adding more investments every year and hopefully, that translates into strong facilities. And so I would say at a certain stage, some extra investments will not generate more growth. And then we have to start questioning it, but at this stage you see its working really well for us. Luca Zaramella : So it is self-funding, I mean for the algorithm to work and for us to be able to deliver upon the promise of share growth, high-single-digit EPS and $3 billion of cash flow. That algorithm itself includes a level of investment, which is factored in, and it is allowing us to hit on all those numbers. I think in the end, the measure of success for us is whether we will be able to deliver share gains consistently. And the second one is, if we increase our volume consistently, all of that came to fruition in 2019. Dirk Van de Put : Then the second part of the question, there was a little bit of a disturbance in the line. Could you repeat it maybe? Luca Zaramella : I think I got it. It was about... Ken Zaslow : Yes. On the European side, it seems like you keep on getting margin expansion utilization. Basically the assets have been put together through acquisitions. As you keep on getting leverage and do some restructuring a little bit. It sounds like the utilization rates should continue to increase. Where have they been? Where are they? And where are they going I guess is kind of what I\u2019m thinking? Luca Zaramella : Yes. Look, I think in general terms we don\u2019t comment on capacity utilization by result. I think that\u2019s \u2013 that will be a bit of too much of a comment I will say. Look, we have invested quite a bit in terms of both creating a more nimble and a more flexible organization, both in overheads and infrastructure, it\u2019s not only legacy site. We invested in brand new sites in Europe. And Europe I remind you is a little bit more than continental Europe or UK. It is also Russia in our case. So I would characterize the old status of the facilities in Europe quite good. It can be further optimized but we still have available capacity in terms of continuing, growing the big blockbuster brands that we have. Milka is one example, Cadbury, Oreo but also the local brands and I think that\u2019s what we\u2019re working on. Ken Zaslow : Great. Thank you very much. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you. Dirk Van de Put : Well in conclusion I would say that 2019 was a major step forward for the company and it was the first full year of executing our new strategy. We\u2019ve successfully launched and driven this more consumer centric approach to get growth across organization and as a result, we are building an effective Local First Culture that is delivering. We are a good finish to the year with broad-based revenue growth and strong earnings and cash flow. And the momentum we\u2019ve created across our brands and our geographies this past year reinforces our confidence that we have in our strategy, our people, and our ability to execute. There\u2019s certainly more work to do, and a long way of opportunities is ahead of us, but we believe that the early success combines with the attractive category dynamics, and further targeted investment provides us greater confidence that we can deliver sustained long-term growth and attractive total returns. With that I would like to end the call. Thank you for assisting. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Today\u2019s call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Mondelez management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President, Investor Relations from Mondelez. Please go ahead, sir. Shep Dunlap : Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO; and Luca Zaramella, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website, mondelezinternational.com/investors. During this call, we\u2019ll make forward-looking statements about the Company\u2019s performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. As we discuss our results today, unless note as reported, we\u2019ll be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures, which adjust for certain items included in our GAAP results. In addition, we provide our year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. You can find the comparable GAAP measures and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation. Before I speak to the agenda, I would like to remind everyone that we have an upcoming investor call on May 8 to coincide with our annual Snacking Made Right report. Both Dirk and our Chief Impact Officer, Chris McGrath will discuss sustainability and wellbeing. They\u2019ll talk more about our approach, targets and progress on this call as well as answer your questions on those topics. In today\u2019s call, Dirk will provide a business update. Then Luca will take you through the financials and our outlook. We\u2019ll close with Q&A. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Dirk. Dirk Van de Put : Thanks, Shep, and hello, everybody. Let me begin by saying thank you to our colleagues for all that they are doing during this unprecedented human crisis in our factories, our facilities, our distribution network and our sales force. Our teams are working night and day to keep the food supply chain going. Our greatest asset is our people. They\u2019re determined and dedicated. They\u2019re courageous and they do love our consumers. Because of them, we have delivered outstanding results in exceptional circumstances. I\u2019d also like to take the opportunity to wish everybody else all the best at this difficult time, our investors, our business partners and clients and of course, our consumers. The challenges we face are unlike anything we\u2019ve seen before, but we firmly believe really merged stronger from this. In turning to Slide 5, we have clear priorities for managing the volatile environment that is caused by this pandemic. First, we are supporting our colleagues. Their wellbeing is our highest concern. We\u2019ve put in place strict health protocols including temperature screening, social distancing, mass clearing, and the mandatory work from home policy for everyone who can and we\u2019ve provided frontline employees with enhanced benefit. We extended sickly for anyone who contracts the virus and in markets like the U.S., we announced increased hourly pay and bonuses for frontline workers. We\u2019re also supporting our communities. In March, we announced the program to donate $15 million in cash and products to COVID relief. And in fact, we\u2019ve already exceeded our original plan by $5 million. The recipients included the Red Cross organizations in the United States, Italy, Switzerland and the Philippines, the National Health Service trust in UK, and food banks across Latin America to name a few. In addition, our themes have responded to local needs with creative solutions. For instance, in the UK and Slovakia, we redeployed our 3D printers to create parts for face masks used by frontline care workers. And in several markets, we started making hand sanitizers. I\u2019m very proud of our response and believe that we are doing the right thing. Our next priority, of course, is business continuity. Our supply chain has been resilient, and we\u2019ve delivered consistent service to our customers. Case Fill rates, in fact, are at better-than-average levels. We\u2019ve seen an increase in demand in developed markets, and we\u2019ve met it by focusing on the most important SKUs. Our strong relationship with our suppliers have helped us maintain critical raw materials and packaging supplies. And we have worked with local governments to keep our factories open during lockdowns. We\u2019ve also maintained our cost discipline and managed cash appropriately. We\u2019ve made adjustment to spending like more tailored promotions, and in A&C to just focus on working media. We\u2019re reducing non-critical capital expenditure, and are maintaining strict control over working capital and inventory. And we are also closely monitoring foreign exchange markets and adjusting where necessary. Under these circumstances, we are preserving capital and liquidity. We\u2019ve taken opportunities to increase liquidity through extensions to our credit facilities, and we\u2019ve also stopped our share buybacks in March. We refinanced short-term debt also at attractive levels. Overall, our priority is clearly to emerge stronger from this. We are confident that we can do that because before the epidemic took hold, our strategy was working well. We are also better positioned than ever to handle a situation like this, given the consumer focus and the locally oriented organizational structure we\u2019ve put in place recently. We are now accelerating a number of strategic initiatives, and continuing to invest in our brands and capabilities to remain the preferred choice of our customers and our consumers. In turning to Slide 6, we executed well in the first quarter, even as the virus was spreading. Organic net revenue growth was 6.4% driven by developed markets performing strongly in March. Overall, the first two months of the quarter were in line with last year\u2019s results showing strong top and bottom line growth. The exception, of course, was China that showed a significant slowdown in February. But then in March, China started to come back quickly, thanks to our local first approach, which puts the decision rights and the accountability where they are almost \u2013 where they are the most needed. Also, North America and Europe became strong drivers. Consumers not only stocked up but also consumed more of their trusted brands and including some new consumers entering into our brands. Execution was strong for our Easter business, and our teams were very agile in meeting that increased demand. And our supply chain stayed strong and was resilient. At the same time, emerging markets started to experience disruptions. Sometimes we had quite abrupt lockdowns that made sales and distribution more difficult. Because of the lockdowns, we also saw a decreased offtake in the traditional trade. And these lockdowns sometimes made it even difficult to produce because our people could not reach the factories. Despite these difficulties and the headwinds, we will continue to see that the long-term prospects of emerging markets remain attractive. Our emerging market footprint is a differentiator and is a key part of our long-term growth strategy. A few other channels also performed less well due to COVID. Our world travel retail business dropped significantly, and also away-from-home was impacted. All this the reduction in traditional trade and the away-from-home hit gum and candy, which is sold more often in away-from-home channels. We also incurred higher costs to keep clients supplied. The mix changed due to higher demand for larger family packs, for instance. Our supply chain cost also rose because we had to hire temporary workers, we had to increase compensation and saw costs for distribution increase, and we did see some currency impacts in emerging markets. So far in April, what we see is that where we have the freedom to operate, we are doing quite well. In developed markets, we continue to see elevated demand, though not at the same level as in March. And in emerging markets, we do have clear headwinds driven by lockdowns and potential economic downturns. We also expect those cost headwinds to continue because we will continue to invest in additional health and safety measures to protect our people. We will continue to see higher personnel and distribution costs. The mix will continue to be a factor, and we will see the ongoing impact of ForEx. All this makes it difficult to forecast what will happen. But overall, we do expect to come out of this stronger with increased market share. Now to Slide 7. Despite this challenging environment, I think we can be proud of what we have achieved. Since September 2018, we have increased investment in our brands, both in terms of quantity but also quality and ROI. As a consequence, we saw record share levels in Q1. We held or gained share in 80% of our markets. Biscuits, which is around 45% of revenue, has seen the biggest spike in demand due to COVID-19, and that also is a category where we saw share increase the most. Overall, just to give a few examples. In the U.S., our Biscuit brands, Oreo, belVita, Ritz, Triscuit and Wheat Thins out-posted mid-teens growth or more in the first quarter, which drove share gains of 2.5 points in the last reading. In China, we saw share gains of 7 points in the latest reading. And in the UK, we saw gains of 1.5 points over the Easter period. While dynamics were different by market, global snacking categories were strong. We also saw strong momentum in our categories, especially in biscuits and chocolate, but less so in gum and candy. On Slide 8, as stated, we expect headwinds in the second quarter, but we remain very positive about our longer-term prospects. We are convinced we will emerge stronger because we are the market leaders in resilient categories and have an unrivaled portfolio of global and local brands. We\u2019re seeing consumers snacking more. They are looking for that moment of comfort offered by biscuits and chocolate in today\u2019s stressful circumstances. In particular, our trusted brands and our taste of the nation brands bring a sense of normalcy, and we can give the consumer that normalcy with our brands around the world. So since we have a unique setup, thanks to our brands, also our organization and scale, we are convinced our categories will continue to present significant opportunities. We\u2019re also focused on operational excellence. We will keep manufacturing, shipping and delivering despite the many headwinds around the world. Our powerful direct store distribution in the U.S. to our deep-rooted local distribution in emerging markets will make sure that our products will continue to be available for consumers. We\u2019re also managing our costs in order to be able to invest to win. So we are fully planning to continue to increase support for our brands and capitalize on the recent share gains as we are focused on long-term sustainable growth. At the same time, we will double down on driving efficiency by accelerating simplification initiatives, increasing our agility and very strong cost controls. And lastly, we have liquidity and balance sheet strength because we further strengthened our balance sheet and the liquidity so that we can make sure that we can handle the fluid situation no matter what. So let me turn to our strategy on Slide 9. We will continue to focus on our three strategic priorities and our long-term financial algorithm. Although we will take opportunities to make short-term tactical shifts as required. We are convinced our strategy is the right one, and it\u2019s proving to be a plus in the current situation. Our local-first approach with strong local business unit empowerment and an efficient supply chain is giving us speed and reliability. Our organization has gone through a lot of change, and we have developed more agility, so we were able to adapt quickly to the new circumstances. Our local brands are showing a resurgence driven by consumers going back to a feeling of comfort and trust in familiar products. And as you know, a big chunk of our portfolio are local brands. We\u2019re also taking the opportunity to accelerate certain initiatives. In growth, we are adjusting our marketing and innovation projects by increasing our spend on working media and at the same time, simplifying our portfolio. In addition, we see opportunities in both revenue management and in e-commerce, where we can capitalize on increased demand from at-home shopping. On execution, we\u2019ll increase our supply chain efficiency while continue to reduce our cost basis. We are also streamlining the amount of projects and activities here. And in culture, we\u2019ll build on the agility we\u2019ve seen in the organization to further enhance our ways of working. Turning to Slide 10, we remain committed to our people and communities for the long-term, and believe our sustainability initiatives are as important as ever. Companies need to be doing the right thing. And due to this crisis, the consumer will become even more conscious about the fragility of our planet. So our focus is on protecting our ecosystem; we are caring for our people, we\u2019ve made donations to support our communities; we\u2019ve increased credit support to our suppliers and our distributors to help them weather the crisis; and we\u2019re determined to continue to deliver on our environmental and social goals. And on May 8, as Shep mentioned, we will have a special investor session to highlight our ESG targets and plans. We invite you all to join the call. And with that, I will hand it over to Luca. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Dirk, and good afternoon. Before getting into our financial results, I would like to echo Dirk\u2019s comment when it comes to thanking our people and teams across this company. I\u2019m really proud of how everyone in the organization has come together in the face of this situation and brought their resolve, energy and creativity to help us navigate challenges and finding solutions. With respect to results, we have some performance the first quarter on both the top and bottom line. Our revenue grew by 6.4% and will supported by the expansion in each one of our four regions, with particular strength in North America and Europe. We also delivered record share growth performance throughout the quarter, due to a combination of supply chain and sales execution as well as recognized quality of our global and local brands. These factors enabled us to grow share by 50 basis points on a year-to-date basis, and 1 point in the latest reading, or hold or gained share in 80% of our revenue base. Our revenue growth driven by favorable volume and pricing dynamics enabled us to post solid profit dollar and EPS growth despite some significant COVID related costs. In addition to turning in a good P&L performance, we also took an opportunity out of an abundance of caution to further strengthen our balance sheet position and liquidity profile. On Slide 13, you can see we performed well across all our key metrics. Importantly, we generated significant profit dollar growth with volume leverage that offset extra costs related to COVID. This allowed us to invest more A&C in the quarter. Moving to Slide 14. We saw our top line results driven by an acceleration in our developed market, which grew more than 7%. These markets were performing well through February before step up in March due to increase in-home consumption. This trend has extended into April, though at a less elevated rate and predominantly in North America, as Europe\u2019s positive impact in retail is offset by headwinds in our whole travel retail business. Emerging market growth was 4.5%, or 2.4% when excluding Argentina. Similar to developed markets and leading China aside, this set of countries was performing very well and in line with our expectations for the first two months of the quarter before strict lockdowns in late March began to have a material impact on traditional trade. China was a bright spot, as the team did an outstanding job and demonstrated resilience in order to not only bounce back from COVID-related headwinds, but actually post low single-digit growth for the entire quarter. Overall, the potential of emerging markets remains unchanged, and we will continue to invest appropriately to maximize long-term growth opportunities in these markets. Biscuit is performing extremely well, given the advantaged position and trusted brands that we have, predominantly in developed markets. Chocolate overall was positive, but not impacted by some emerging market lockdowns, particularly India and our travel retail business. Overall, notwithstanding some COVID-related headwinds, we were very happy with our chocolate performance in Q1. Now let\u2019s review our profitability on Slide 15. We increased gross profit by nearly 6% in Q1. Strong volume in developed markets was partially offset by roughly flat volume mix in emerging markets, primarily as a result of COVID disruptions. Pricing was positive across both developed and emerging market, and in all of our four regions. Additional costs associated with overtime, frontline workforce bonuses and customer service and logistics tempered gross profit results. Operating income grew nearly 6%, as high A&C and front line expenses were partially offset by cost reduction programs and volume mix gains. Moving to regional performance on Slide 16. North America grew 13.4% driven by strong share gains and COVID-related consumption. Biscuits growth was broad based across both global and local brands. Oreo, belVita, Ritz, Triscuit and Wheat Thins out-posted mid-teens growth or more. Strong execution in manufacturing, our robust DSD network and alternative channel growth in cloud value and e-commerce were critical factors in achieving this performance. Although the quarter was strong, we did see softer results in Gum, given its impose nature and the lag in convenience relative to other channels as well as some share losses in Gum. The North American region grew operating income by more than 20% as significant volume leverage more than offset additional labor and distribution costs. Europe executed well in the quarter with revenue growth of 4.3%. Strong sales, supply chain and brand execution resulted in a largely volume-driven growth quarter. The UK, Germany and Italy all grew mid-single digits, while Russia continued its momentum with high single growth behind strong volumes and share gains. Our Easter season was successful with flat year-over-year growth, which is outstanding given the shorter Easter season and COVID-related challenges. Importantly, we believe the early sell-out data suggests share gains. On the flip side, we did experience some headwinds related to the convenience channels, mostly in World Travel Retail and Gum. Adjusted OI dollar declined slightly due to a more difficult compare related to commodity cost pipeline, which we expected and we mentioned to you last quarter as well as some higher A&C costs and some COVID-related costs. AMEA grew 2.2% with some different dynamics across the region. A number of markets, such as India and Southeast Asia saw significant disruptions late in the quarter related to strict lockdowns that caused widespread traditional trade closures as well as some difficulties to operate. In fact, both India and Southeast Asia were slightly positive for the quarter. China recovered quite well from the lockdown and grew low single digits in the quarter behind strong Biscuit results. Australia and New Zealand delivered a good performance with mid-single-digit growth behind strong Easter execution and share gains in chocolate. Overall, and on the positive side, AMEA is posting a very good performance on shares with widespread gains. AMEA operating income dollars declined by approximately 8% due primarily to lower-than-typical volumes and leverage in addition to extra costs related to COVID. Latin America grew 7% due primarily to inflation driven growth in Argentina. Revenue was flat when excluding Argentina. Mexico grew slightly behind solid Biscuit performance. And although the market decline in Gum and Candy, we grew share. In Brazil, we were flat. Biscuits and candy were solid, while the powder beverage category continued to decline. We took actions in Q1 around new marketing communication and product formulation but it is very early stages. Our Western Andean countries were at the harvest in the region by COVID. An aggressive lockdown had a significant impact on the traditional trade, which is most of the business in this country cluster. Adjusted OI dollars in Latin America declined by 3.5%, primarily due to headwinds associated with negative mix as well as the impact of currency. Turning to EPS on Slide 20. Q1 EPS grew nearly 11%. This increase primarily reflected operating gains driven by revenue growth. Clearly, we saw the impact of COVID in the top line as well as in additional expenses to keep the operations running at the right levels. Moving forward, we expect costs related to labor, customer service and logistics to increase, and we expect a negative mix impact. Our teams are working to find offset. However, we expect the net effect on earnings to be significant in terms of additional costs as we look at Q2 and into the second half. I\u2019ll now move on to our free cash flow results on Slide 21. We delivered free cash flow of $70 million, which was in line with our plans and included some discrete indirect tax payments. We are maintaining strong rigor around both working capital and our own cash management. We have clear priorities for the remainder of the year, which include protecting critical reducing non-critical items. Optimizing discretionary cash spending and aligning restructuring initiatives to new needs in this operating environment. Moving to Page 22. We returned $1.1 billion to our shareholders in the first quarter. As a cautionary measure, we made the decision to suspend our share buyback program. There is no change to our long or short-term dividend policy. Although we maintain \u2013 although we may adjust tactics to reduce non-critical uses of cash and maximize liquidity, our focus and prioritization of investing in our business is unchanged. While on capital allocation, I wanted to make mention of our acquisition of Give & Go for approximately $1.2 billion, which closed on April 1. This growth platform is a leader in the large and fast-growing in-store bakery channel with fully finished fresh products. This category has been growing mid-single digit over the past several years, and that\u2019s been gaining square footage in stores, and it is a demand driver. We are excited about the opportunity to further grow this platform, and cross-sell with some of our traditional brands. Although the acquisition did not close until early April, the business performed well in Q1. Let me take a moment to address an area that I know is on the mind of investors across all of their portfolio companies which is balance sheet trends and liquidity. We feel very good about the strength and flexibility of our balance sheet. We have ample liquidity with approximately $9.5 billion of committed and mostly undrawn credit facilities. In addition, we have opened a low-cost access to that capital market. This includes commercial paper or the recent $1 billion in debt that we issued earlier this month at favorable rates. Let me underscore that we are committed to maintaining our investment-grade status and access to Tier 2 commercial paper. As you saw from our release earlier, we are no longer providing a financial outlook for the full year 2020. The outlook for the balance of the year depends heavily on the expected impact of COVID-19 and the duration of the staying at home orders across regions. Both of which remained uncertain, limiting our ability to forecast with precision. A few additional points I would like to make related to our outlook and year. Our near focus is on all of our people and those that play a key role across our manufacturing, distribution and sales function. We are seeing incremental costs and cannot predict what new headwinds might emerge as a result of COVID crisis. We will make decisions to protect our people and come out of this situation stronger. Given the circumstances, quarterly earnings will obviously be less of a priority, but our long-term strategy and focus around investing in our business and driving balanced profitable growth has not changed. Although, we\u2019re not providing full year guidance at this time, I wanted to share some thoughts regarding tailwinds and headwinds from the second quarter. With respect to tailwind, we expect continued positive impact from increase in-home consumption and expandable consumption in developed markets, especially in this case. We are also taking some actions to mitigate costs across the business, which means taking a fresh look at the entire business and looking for additional opportunities that do not impact our revenue-generating investment. We also expect some tailwinds from optimizing A&C investment, which means the timing is likely to shift in certain cases from Q2 to the second half. In terms of expected headwinds, we expect the negative impact that we saw in late March and through April to continue in emerging markets as it relates to traditional trade closures. World travel retail, which is a few hundred million dollar business, is expected to see significant declines. Our Gum category, which is consumed more than our other categories out-of-home and is the most impose in nature, is expected to see material declines. And we expect higher costs to drive our current operation and support the continuity of business during the crisis. Currency impact is greater now than earlier this year. As we stand today, it would decrease full year net revenue growth by approximately 4% \u2013 5% and adjusted EPS by approximately $0.10. We will continue to monitor the situation and keep you updated as appropriate. Our long-term growth algorithm is unchanged. As Dirk said earlier, we will continue to run this business for mid to long-term sustainable growth, which means we are investing to win in the market by delivering share gains to drive profit dollars and to return capital to our shareholders. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Dirk for some closing comments. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you, Luca. As we look to the next weeks and months, we are clear about our priority, are: first interest is in taking care of our people, keeping them protected and being a good partner to customers and suppliers by taking care of our ecosystem. As stated, while we may see headwinds in short-term in emerging markets, our long-term emerging market opportunities remain significant, so we will stay the course. Our priority is to ensure routes to market remain intact so we can recover immediately the minute that markets emerge from lockdown. We are prepared to ride the wave of increased demand in our developed markets, and we\u2019ll focus on ensuring our supply chain remains strong to fulfill the increased demand. The current environment is dynamic, and every day brings new challenges, so we will continue to be agile and act with speed to deal with them. And even if we see headwinds in the second quarter, we have everything we need to emerge stronger and faster. And as such, we\u2019ll continue to invest in our brands, our customers and our people. With that, I will turn to Shep to open the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Great. Thanks very much everybody. Dirk, to start off, you talked a number of times about looking to emerge from all of this in a stronger position. I was hoping you could expand a bit on that. It\u2019s clear market shares took a big step forward. And it seems like scale, brand strength, supply chain have all been pretty clear advantages at this stage. But I guess, should we anticipate some additional investment as the year progresses, if there are opportunities to do so. And if so, what form might those take, whether it\u2019s advertising, go-to-market investments and such. That would be helpful. And then just I have a quick follow-up. Dirk Van de Put : Okay. Thank you, Andrew. I would say, first of all, we were entering this crisis unlike in the past from a position of strength, and our strategy was working. We saw good growth in January and February and we had a recipe that was working for us, and we are trying to get back to the recipe as soon as we possibly can and we get this behind us. You pointed out a few things there, categories. If you go back to past crisis, particularly Biscuits, but also Chocolate tend to do quite well. Gum and Candy, a little bit less, but also meals, cheese in these circumstances are not that much affected and sometimes see increased consumption as you, for instance, can see right now with Biscuits. While we are the global market leader, we still have significant headroom to grow and you saw the results of this quarter, and I think that will still be a big possibility for us to keep on increasing our market share, particularly in circumstances where some of the more local or smaller competition might have a slightly hardest time than we do. I think we have the right set up with the local teams, changing the structure that we did. We saw in China \u2013 3%-plus growth in China in the first quarter is excellent work by our team. And that is through the fact that they made the decisions right away and they were on the ball, and could make things happen without having to pass a lot things. And then, I think we still have the opportunity to go wider with our categories, both organically and with our brands, and we can go also inorganically. Maybe this period offers an opportunity, just as we have recently done with perfect \u2013 done with Perfect Snacks and Give & Go. There is a number of other things I think that we are working on. Execution has been excellent for us. We are reducing investment in the second quarter and trying to increase our investment in the third and the fourth quarter, which would mean over the year that probably we will not increase our investment. But at least keep it stable and have a significant increase, when things are back to normal in the second half of the year of our investments and see some return to growth as soon as we can, or continuation of growth depending on what happens in the second quarter. So, I think, all that are reasons for us that we believe that we can emerge from this stronger, and we are accompanying all that, as Luca said, with strong focus on costs, which allow us to do that extra investment in the second half and absorb some of the headwinds that we will be facing. So, I think those are some of the reasons \u2013 the main reasons why we believe that we can come out of this stronger, and that\u2019s really our focus. Andrew Lazar : Okay. Thank you for that. And then, just a quick one maybe, just if you could, a quick walk around just some of the key emerging markets. They are not all created equal, and how long you maybe see it taking in some of these key markets to get back to a more normalized consumption pattern obviously with the best information we have today? Thank you. Dirk Van de Put : Yes. So, first of all, I think, as you know, we have strong positions. We have a clear strategy in these markets and we have strong local management, which is critical in these times. If you start to group our emerging markets, overall they are about, let\u2019s call it, 37% of our net revenue. But if you look at the groups within that, I think it\u2019s important to sort of separate them and understand a little bit what\u2019s going on. So, first one is China. China is over 10% of our emerging markets. We saw low single-digit growth in Q1. We had a strong bounce back. We had significant share gains. And while maybe the categories Biscuits and Gum or not quite back to where they were before the crisis, through that market share gain, we are doing quite well, and we see the market recovering gradually. India is another important market for us, of course, also 10% of our emerging markets, a significant closures of the traditional trade at the moment, which is about 75% of our revenues. There is clear, some short-term impact, but we expect sequential easing of restrictions. We have very strong distribution system. We\u2019ve got products that are across all price points with a strong presence in low unit price points. So, I think, the return there will be fast, plus we can still grow by increasing our distribution and going into adjacencies. And then, the last one there, Southeast Asia is really into a similar position as India. So that cluster, I would say, China is already kind of back in India, Southeast Asia will go fast. Second cluster is Eastern and Central Europe, not that heavily affected in the first quarter. There will be more lockdown restrictions in the first half of April, but overall, traditional trade is only about 20% of revenues there. We have a strong team. We did also have strong share gains, and we have a very good branding strategy. So we think this part will not be as heavily affected and we will be back to normal quite strongly. And then, switching to Latin America, Mexico, which is \u2013 those European markets are more than 20% of our emerging markets. And then Mexico, we think that we have a macro environment that\u2019s soft, but operations are continuing to run well. They\u2019re related to the crisis, and we see a deeper contraction. But we have strong consistent trackers and we think we will come back fast. So, I would say, about two-thirds of our emerging markets we feel pretty good about. And then the others, that\u2019s where we have much stronger traditional trade. I\u2019m talking about Argentina, Brazil, Middle East and Africa and WACAM. I think those will take a little bit more time. There is a dynamic of traditional trade that is closed with some devaluation, so that it will need to be some pricing. It\u2019s only one-third of our emerging markets, but that really remains somewhat challenged and it will probably take us six to nine months to return here. So, that\u2019s a quick tour about \u2013 around our emerging markets. I hope it was helpful. But I think it\u2019s important to group it in different clusters, because they\u2019re not all created equal. Andrew Lazar : Yes. Thanks very much. Luca Zaramella : Thank you. Dirk Van de Put : Thanks, Andrew. Operator : Your next question is from Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, guys. Hope everyone is doing well in this environment. Dirk Van de Put : Hey, Dara. Luca Zaramella : Yes, I hope the same Dara Mohsenian : First, in developed markets where you\u2019ve seen the demand strength, can you discuss how much of the increased demand may be more consumer pantry loading versus actual increased consumption and based on the research you mentioned how sticky higher consumption levels might be going forward when social distancing ends? And then, in emerging markets, all the comments around duration were helpful. Can you give us a bit more clarity on if Q2 in aggregate looks like the March sales decline that you guys outlined in the low single-digit decline. Obviously there are various puts and takes by region, but just trying to get a bit more clarity specifically on expectations for Q2 relative to what we saw in March in the emerging markets region? Thanks. Dirk Van de Put : Okay. I\u2019m sure that Luca will want to jump in certainly on the second question, but if he wants to, on the first question, we\u2019re not in the same location today, we are all at home. So it\u2019s a little bit less fluid. So, in the U.S., I would say, yes, there was an original pantry loading in our categories and you would see in Biscuits growth that would approach 30%. And then in the weeks after we saw that come down to high-single digit. First, low double-digit, now high single-digit. We\u2019ve been interviewing consumers around the world and we can say that it\u2019s clear there is increased snacking. And there\u2019s three basic reasons for that as we saw. The first one is that there is a lot of out-of-home consumption that has now shifted to in-home. And in-home, there is more grazing, more continuous eating, and snacking takes up a much bigger role, particularly Biscuits. The snacking categories that consumers tell us they are eating more is cheese, so Philadelphia is benefiting also, is fruit and veggies, is biscuits and some salted snacks. So, that\u2019s the one reason. The second reason is that sharing a snack with your kids as everybody sort of cooked up in the house brings back a feeling of normalcy of togetherness calming everybody down, and we see them quote that as a big reason. And the third one is that there is some more experimenting going on. We see consumers \u2013 new consumers entering our brands. So, for brands like Oreo and Ritz, that was somewhere between 15% to 20%, but in some of our other brands like Fig Newtons or Nutter Butter, it\u2019s over 40% new consumers. So it\u2019s clear that the consumption is going up. The penetration is going up, and that\u2019s what we currently are seeing. And I believe, as long as we are in this uncertain situation, and as long as we are not having the same out-of-home consumption, our categories, particularly Biscuits, but also Chocolate will benefit from that. By the way, what I quoted here on the U.S., we see the same in Europe 50% of consumers there also say that they are increasing their snacking more occasions and more quantity, and particularly Biscuits, but also Chocolates has seen quite an increase there. So that\u2019s a little bit on that consumption that we\u2019re seeing in developed markets. And maybe, switch to emerging markets, I don\u2019t know, Luca, if you want to take that one? Luca Zaramella : All right. I can go if you prefer. Yes. Well, maybe we can \u2013 you start, and then I\u2019ll complement and I\u2019ll answer the Q2 part of the question. Dirk Van de Put : So, from an emerging markets perspective, what we\u2019re seeing is that, in March, the effect was driven by some of the very serious and severe lockdowns that started to happen in places like India, the Philippines, Malaysia. And then, they shifted gradually into Latin America and into places like South Africa. They \u2013 of course, since our business is more in the traditional trade there, the effect has been bigger because the consumers don\u2019t go through those stores, our sales force and distribution trucks are not always allowed to go there, and the owners often close their stores. That\u2019s starting to come back so April for sure we will see that effect. And I think that in May, we will start to see a significant easing of that situation, and then in June, we will gradually be back to normal. We are all set up to make sure that our route to market is intact. So we\u2019ve been working very closely with our distributors to make sure that they\u2019re ready to go and that they are in business and surviving, and we are planning to immediately go back. And even in the tough circumstances, the situation, for instance, in India at the beginning was much more severe than it is now. We\u2019re certainly not back to selling what we were selling before, but we\u2019ve improved quite a bit already. So I would say it\u2019s still a tough April, May improving, and I think June, we should see some return close to normal situation as it relates to visiting and selling into these channels. Luca? Luca Zaramella : Yes. And thereon Q2, I think, as you said yourself, there are clearly several puts and takes. Certainly in the last part of Q1 in March, and those will expand into Q2, and there is a page in the presentation in the prepared remarks where we discussed several factors as key drivers. How each one will play out going forward? It is quite difficult to predict at this point in time, and there could be both positive and negative impact affecting our quarterly earnings. At this point, quite frankly, we see the acceleration of our Q2 top line versus Q1, given that as Dirk highlighted, the impact of emerging markets was partial in Q1, and it is going to its full expand certainly in April and most likely into part of May. We also see some places that while supply chain is keeping up quite well, particularly in the U.S., and we are very proud with that, there are situations around the world where we have some capacity constraints, and one would be certain places in Europe in Biscuit, but might be potentially some capacity related issues. As we said very clearly, one of the elements that is coming up in Q2 is also the fact that we see higher cost to drive the business. But on the flip side, we\u2019re working quite intensely to find out any opportunities. We are not going to invest in places where we clearly are capacity constrained or where the demand pickup is very high, but has the exact intention is to go back in the second part of the year and actually spent the same amount of money that we had planned in our original plan. In this time of uncertainties again, it is difficult to make predictions, but we have to do certainties. As we said, we want to stay true to our strategy. We will continue to invest for growth. What Dirk said about more traditional brands being picked up by consumers these days as never before give us an opening to be able to introduce in a stable way. These brands seem to be referred to our \u2013 all of our consumers, and we want to take that opportunity very, very seriously. We also, as I said, are looking at all costs, and both tactically and structurally, we are making decisions that will affect the cost structure going forward trying to offset some of the cost implications that we clearly see in part of Q1. We will see more in Q2, and potentially some of that will stay also going forward. Dara Mohsenian : Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you, Dara. Operator : Your next question is from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, Bryan. Luca Zaramella : Hi, Bryan. Bryan Spillane : So, I just \u2013 I had one question. In the conversation so far, there has been a lot of focus on how the lockdowns are affecting your business in emerging markets right now, and maybe how it affected in developed markets, almost in a positive way? But I guess, as we get through this that we end up potentially with the recession in a period of elevated unemployment. Could you just talk about how that factors into sort of a recovery to normalcy? Do you have the flexibility to sort of adjust price points or do things to affect affordability? Just trying to understand how a recession potentially affects the ability to kind of get back to normal. Dirk Van de Put : Yes. So, probably the points to make here, and of course it\u2019s difficult to estimate because this is a very particular type of recession. We don\u2019t quite know how we\u2019re going \u2013 how fast and how we\u2019re going to get out of it. So we base a little bit our learnings on past recessions. So, our categories are durable, and they are not that much affected by these recessions we\u2019ve seen in the past, and I\u2019m talking largely about Biscuit and Chocolate. And in past recessions, they were affected, but they didn\u2019t go down in a major way. I would also say, our products are affordable and they are skewed to in-home consumption. And as we discussed before, this is really a recession whereby in-home consumption is benefiting from it. Even our chocolate, which is largely tablet chocolate, it\u2019s not like bar chocolate is largely in-home consumption. So I think we benefit from that. And then, also private label, which in other categories does well. Private label is penetration in our categories is quite low. Although gum is not our biggest part of our business, we\u2019ve seen in past recessions that that is usually affected and we see that already. So our estimates at the moment was that before all this started that our categories with grew 3% globally. We think that it\u2019s reasonable to assume that they may slow down to 2%, 2.5%, but we feel that we should try to make that up by gaining share. And as the recent periods showed that has been possible for us. The reason why we think we can do so good in share is that we are entering this in a position of strength. I believe we\u2019ve done well in investing in the last two years in our brands, they are stronger than in the previous year. Hence, the market share increased, the portfolios modernized, our communications are much more effective. We have seen in the past, wherein recessions we went in trying to protect in the first place, the bottom line in cutting investments, in brands and capability, that is not the right approach. Because that results in share loss and volume decline. So there is \u2013 we will try to play a much finer balance here between top line and bottom line going forward. And I think some of the issues we\u2019ve had in the past as it relates to execution, North America comes to mind two years ago. We don\u2019t have that at the moment, and I\u2019m particularly happy to see what we\u2019ve done recently in these months in North America or how China has come back. And I think execution is a strength for us. Now having said all that, we are making some adjustments that will make it easier for us during the recession. We are reducing our portfolio in the number of SKUs and also the number of innovation initiatives. We are working very hard on the right-pack sizes is doing, what we call, PPA on one hand to get the price points right in emerging markets. But on the other hand also, they have the right at-home facts. We are already looking at investments in overheads and going through all our ZBB pillars again and doing an extra round of savings there. We are doing the same in our supply chain and we are looking for efficiencies as it relates in our ways of working since the crisis showed that we can work in different ways. And maybe we don\u2019t need all the offices that we currently have around the world. So there is a major effort going \u2013 taking place as it relates to the costs in the business. So having said all that, I think that, yes, there will be a recession. It\u2019s going to be different by country. Some countries have seen devaluations where we will need to price more. Other countries, we are already set up well, and it\u2019s really about getting in front of the consumer and communicating. So, it\u2019s a mixed bag, but we feel confident that we have the right recipe to get through the recession in a relatively strong and fast way. Luca Zaramella : Yes. Maybe just one thing I would add to that, it is \u2013 Bryan. I just step back and you look at the broader strategy we had at CAGNY. We still see tremendous opportunities in emerging markets in terms of distribution route-to-market adjacencies. And I think, on the other side, there could be organic and inorganic opportunities as well. So, we are looking at everything and trying to be ready for maybe challenging times, but we believe we can emerge even stronger in those markets. Bryan Spillane : All right, thank you. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Bryan. Operator : Your next question is from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow : Hi. Thank you for the question. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, Robert. Luca Zaramella : Hi, Robert. Robert Moskow : I want to know about your developed markets sales in 2Q. And any \u2013 it looks like the sales trends are going to remain very strong because of at-home consumption. Have you done any math to figure out how much the first quarter benefited from one-time pantry loading? And maybe that can help us figure out how to think about North America sales growth in 2Q and maybe even Europe. I understand the emerging market guidance, I guess, but I\u2019m not sure how much to decelerate developed markets in 2Q. Luca Zaramella : So maybe I\u2019ll start, and then, Dirk, yes, sorry \u2013 do you want to go, Dirk? Dirk Van de Put : No, no, no. Go ahead, Luca. No problem. Luca Zaramella : I think, on the specific question on how much you\u2019re going to see into Q2, again, we see heightened consumption in North America and in some parts of Europe, I think, look, the simple way to answer this question is, before the breakout of COVID, our categories were a little bit north of 3%. And on top of that, we were gaining share. I think, both on positive and negatives, what you see as a difference versus the three category \u2013 the 3% plus category and the share gains is the difference that is attributable to COVID. And I would leave it there, high level because it is quite frankly very difficult to understand what would have happened otherwise. I mean, this is literally very different than we could have expected \u2013 any one of us. I think, on the other side, I would also tell you, when I look at January and February, those were great months for us. And in developing markets, in places like India as one example, we saw exactly the same trends as last year. Clearly, with the exception of China that got impacted earlier. So, it\u2019s very difficult for us to tell you what it would have been, but the reference point that I would have, if I had to make an educated guess is, 3% categories and share gains in line with what you saw in Q4 last year, to give you a little bit of the consumption understanding. Robert Moskow : Okay, thanks. A quick follow-up. You mentioned higher cost to drive the operations in 2Q. Can you help us quantify your overall COVID cost increases for the year, and how much it will be higher in 2Q versus 1Q? Luca Zaramella : Look, again, this is \u2013 the reason why we didn\u2019t give guidance is because we don\u2019t have visibility on some of these elements and particularly on the duration of the crisis, and some of the costs are related to unutilized assets or under-absorption, which clearly is a little bit of an element that will play-out in Q2. Just for reference, the extra COVID cost in Q1 was around about $40 million to $50 million, most likely closer to $50 million than $40 million, and all of these excludes the volume impact of COVID. So, purely cost in Q1, we had $40 million to $50 million. In Q2, we are going to see quite a bit of a pickup. And the reason being that, particularly in emerging markets, there is a lockdown that is impacting our sales force, there are standard cost, we continue seeing the extra bonuses that we are paying to the sales force and to people that operate in our factories. There is a higher level of absenteeism. And in some places, there is a little bit of temporary labor that we need. And in some cases, there is also lower output. So, I had in mind the number, but again it is very preliminary. We are trying to manage it down, and most importantly what you have to assume is that on top of that cost there will be a series of initiatives on the side that will try to minimize costs where it doesn\u2019t really matter in Q2 to spend with intention again to potentially reinvest some of those savings in the second part of the year. Robert Moskow : Okay. Thanks very much. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you, Robert Operator : Your next question is from Steven Strycula with UBS. Steven Strycula : Hi. Good afternoon. Luca, quick clarification, not to go back to Slide 6 too much. But I think what a lot of people are trying to feel out right now is the difference between deceleration in Q2 in sales versus decline on a year-over-year basis in sales. And then I think, what I am hearing is, given what\u2019s happening to developed markets, that should be able to \u2013 the math itself should be able to offset what\u2019s happening in EMs. That would be my quick clarification question. And then I have a more fundamental question for Dirk. Luca Zaramella : Look, again, it is really tough for us to give you a number at this point in time. What we see \u2013 we have regular calls with the regions, every single week, and we go to business unit by business unit. There is quite a bit of volatility week to week. What I can tell you is that if you ask me an educated guess at this point in time, we see continuation of the U.S. quite strongly into April and into the second part of the quarter. But we see material declines in emerging markets that has come to a standstill. All-in-all, I would tell you, it might be negative. But there might be a situation where that impacting is minimized. If we can keep up the \u2013 with the demand supply, particularly in Europe and in the U.S. So at this point in time, you\u2019re not going to see a high number in Q2. As you saw in Q1, it could be potentially negative. I don\u2019t know exactly how much, I don\u2019t expect it to be materially negative, that maybe bring you a little bit of color. Steven Strycula : Very helpful. And then Dirk, just wanted to think through a little bit more to maybe Andrew Lazar\u2019s question about emerging markets. How do we think about given the managerial changes you guys have made in the marketplace, how those brand managers are thinking about managing the business on both maybe like a 3 to 12-month view? How are you thinking about driving price pack architecture in some of those regions? Are they resourcing themselves a little bit differently in this type of environment to gain share and how do you think about pricing? Thank you. Dirk Van de Put : Yes. Yes, I think you got it right. So there is a number of changes that our marketing people need to go through. The first one is to understand the mindset of the consumers, and we\u2019ve already started to adapt the communication surrounding our brands in different places around the world to give you an idea, what type of form that takes is in China, as everybody was at home. We started to realize that cooking with Oreo was something that they really like to do. So we switched our communication to cooking with Oreo, and it had a great effect on our sales. So we are doing a number of things as you can imagine there is a lot of links to helping communities and so on and Oreo around the world is about staying playful. So that\u2019s one. Make sure that what our brands communicate is linked to what is on the \u2013 in the minds of the consumer or on the mind of the consumer. The second one is to understand that, which price points we need to be, and that\u2019s a lot of work in PPA, promotions, different packs. And the packs might be smaller or bigger as I explained between stay-at-home or home consumption and on-the-go consumption. There also we need to make sure that we linked to the different opportunities that we saw with the local brands. So what we\u2019ve seen is that certainly our local brands are getting an increased interest from consumers. I was explaining the inflow of new consumers into those brands. And so what we\u2019ve also asked them to do is to make sure that we give a good boost to those local brands. This might be unique opportunity for us to make sure that we get even more traction there. And then the last thing that I would mention that is much more we\u2019re doing, but this is a moment to really, what I would call it, attack the market, and be strong in the second half of the year. So between the cost savings that we are doing and then shifts within our marketing budgets, where we are shifting a lot of our investment to working media, we are hoping to see a significant increase of our media investment versus last year in the second half of the year, while keeping our P&L obviously within reason. And I think that could have a big effect on the consumer reaction in that second half. Maybe another thing that I would mention is that we are also using this opportunity to significantly reduce the number of SKUs to significant \u2013 we have always have had a lot of innovation projects, not always the most useful ones, I would say. So we are reducing significantly our innovation projects. So we are working on making our business simpler. So that gives you sort of the headlines I would say of what our marketing teams are working through at this stage in trying to adapt to this new situation and making sure that we really win in the second half of the year. Steven Strycula : That\u2019s great. Thanks Dirk Van de Put : Thank you, Steven. Operator : Your next question is from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Yes. Hey, thanks. Dirk Van de Put : Hi. Steve Powers : Again, maybe just to build on that, that dialog, Dirk, and you walked around the emerging markets earlier. I think you did a good job of paying the path toward top line recovery if I understood you correctly. But I guess my question is, from a profitability perspective, does the anticipated improvement run in parallel to that top line recovery with the reabsorption of some underutilized costs or is it likely to come on a slightly further lag given some of those investment initiatives you just spoke to in response to Steve Strycula\u2019s question that the leaning in to win in the back half and beyond? Can you just give us a little perspective that would be great? Dirk Van de Put : Yes, yes, and I\u2019ll maybe give you my perspective on it, and then Luca, I\u2019m sure will jump in also. So the thinking is that we do not have to invest a lot in the second half \u2013 sorry, in the second quarter, because there\u2019s still a lot of channel restructurings and sales restrictions. And for the consumers that are at home, we told you that the consumption is there. So, and on top, we are complementing that with a severe or a serious effort on costs that we\u2019ve launched immediately. The culmination of that will be shifting our investment to the second half and having a significant increase in our media spend. But at the same time, using those cost reductions, as we discussed to keep our bottom line, whether I would call within reason. I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s difficult for us to really forecast Q2. So it\u2019s even more difficult to do H2. But to have a year that we come out and we are ready to enter 2021 where we have invested in our brands. They are strong. We\u2019ve increased our market share. We\u2019ve done that through the moves that I explained, and we have a reasonable bottom line for the year, so that we feel that 2021 can be a real winning year for us. That\u2019s the thinking and we\u2019ve been working through the numbers to make that happen. We accompany that. Some of the cost work we\u2019re doing is \u2013 has to see with our supply chain, with some of our network opportunity. So you can imagine if you reduce your SKUs quite a lot, there is many benefits across the business for that. So some of the work also aims at keeping our supply chain costs under control so that our gross margins also benefit from that. So that\u2019s the thinking. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to achieve. Maybe Luca, you want to add a little bit to that? Luca Zaramella : Yes. I think to your question about the level of under-utilization of some of the assets as the market resumes in emerging market, there might be potentially a lag. I would also tell you one thing though, it is clear at this point in time that some of the trade stock in some of the emerging market is quite low. And so I think there will be a phase as we resume business to normalcy in some of these markets where we will have to make more volume. I think I expect then consumption and expectations from consumers to grow steadily as the thing was going before. So there might be a situation where we actually are able to resume production and get back to some of the levels before crisis quite quickly. As Dick said, emerging markets for us are a little bit of a mixed bag. I would say, if I take China as one example, the fact that we were able to deliver, I think the number was 3%-plus in Q1, that was with volume. And the concept here is, if China is the example of what can happen, and we apply that model to everything, I think it can be very fast. I\u2019m afraid, there will be situations where that will be the case. Others where maybe it will take more time, but we don\u2019t see a huge lag and we don\u2019t see under-absorption as we enter the second part of the year or even as we talk about Q4. Steve Powers : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is from Chris Growe with Stifel. Chris Growe : Hi. Good evening. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, Chris. Luca Zaramella : Hi, Growe. Chris Growe : Hi. Just a question for you, if I could, first will be around the second quarter outlook. Are you anticipating or incorporating some like pantry de-loading by consumers? So has the first quarter benefited unusually from this environment, pantry loading, and then we have some of the negative side of that, if you will in the second quarter. I know there\u2019s probably answer by country, but from a high level, I\u2019m curious how you see that? Dirk Van de Put : At this stage, we do a lot of research. We\u2019ve invested quite a bit in talking to consumers and understanding. At this stage, we do not have the impression that the consumer is sitting on a huge pantry full of our cookies. We\u2019ve seen \u2013 through these interviews, we\u2019ve seen some significant consumption. And so we are not necessarily thinking there will be an enormous pantry de-loading. Our products have a limited shelf life, not as limited as some other snacking products, but they are not good forever. So I think the consumer over the course of the second quarter, and certainly into the third quarter, will be inclined to \u2013 if they would have pantry stock, to consume it. So we are not expecting a massive effect on it. Chris Growe : Okay. And then I have \u2013 go ahead. I\u2019m sorry. Luca Zaramella : Yes, I will go ahead. I just want to make one clarification as Steve is exciting to ask. The comment I made about the top line as it relates to Q2, it was not only for emerging markets, it was for total Mondelez. When I said that might be slightly negative for Q2, but there is still a little bit of a level of uncertainty, and we don\u2019t know exactly how Q2 will pan out for the company. Sorry, Chris, go on. Chris Growe : That\u2019s okay. Thanks for that clarification. So just the second question will be in relation to the incremental pricing that you will need in the business to offset some of those currency induced cost inflation, if anything. I\u2019m just curious, does that start as quickly as the second quarter or you need to get again kind of these countries up and running before you start to implement pricing to start to offset some of the cost inflation? Luca Zaramella : Yes. Look, the reality is we are not necessarily going to face at least from a transaction standpoint the pressure right away. We have good coverage in some of \u2013 all our commodities. So actually went up during the crisis or are going up. And even in exchange rate we are covered quite a bit, and I would say also there are puts and takes. Imagine, we are also importing some staff from some of these markets that had been impacted by the valuation. So I think you can see expect that we are making decisions now to optimize independently from the pipeline that we have, the price realization and the volume implications of it. And so we are seeing some price increases already in some marketplaces. And in some cases, we are implementing, though we are following strictly some of the competitors. But the reality is, we have a little bit of time in terms of protecting our margins, and importantly, this is not about a pure line price increase. This is about what we call revenue growth management. And it will be a fine balance between getting productivities, creating the right price points for consumers and implementing the right actions in the marketplace through advertising, for instance, to ensure that volume is kept and scale is kept. We are working through those plans, literally as we speak. But again, you might expect that independently from corporates that we have, we might make some decisions in the second part of the year, in order to give a little bit of breathing room as we enter 2021. Chris Growe : Okay. Thank you for that very much. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Awesome. Hey, good evening, guys. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, Jason. Luca Zaramella : Hi, Jason. Jason English : Hello, a couple of quick questions from me, if I can. We \u2013 and I apologize if I missed this. You mentioned EMs down 1% or so down low-single digit, sorry down low-single digits throughout the month of March. But I think you also said that it decelerated substantially in the late part of March and remains at that much weaker level through April. What is that weaker level? Dirk Van de Put : Look, again, the \u2013 it really depends on a market-by-market. I give you one example. Take India, okay. India for us, as we have said is a great market. Obviously we all know the potential of that market. It is a $1 billion company for us. I would tell you that when the original lockdown was announced and by the way, there was an unofficial lockdown before that, the company went absolutely blank and it was impossible, given the fact that we have multiple plants to actually get people into the plant, and to have people from the distribution centers to be able to supply the distributors. And it was impossible to even get trucks. So the first phase of the crisis, we literally sold close to zero in that specific market. Today, I would say, we are recovering, and we are a little bit higher than half of the sales that we had last year on a more regular basis. So the situation is improving day by day, but these are the magnitude of the issues we are talking about. And again, the trade is absolutely empty. There is \u2013 so we have an opportunity as we go back to receive the pipeline, and we are absolutely right. And you can also imagine that given the strength of that market, we want to do exactly what we did in China. And so the recovery curve might be very close to China in that market. There are other markets like WACOM, where we sell predominantly through traditional trade and distributors where gum is an important part of the business and so is candy. That market again has been materially declining in the last few weeks. I think again, it can go back to normalcy, but it will take some time. So it is really a mixed bag and it is impossible for me to give you a number that is exactly in Q2 for emerging markets. Also that matter for the totality of the company. Jason English : Okay, okay. Well, I appreciate the effort on it. One more question. I\u2019ll pass it on. I imagine that many people are going to interpret your withdrawals guidance as an indication that the numbers you had put out there before are no longer achievable, that you\u2019re likely to earn something much less. As we run through \u2013 sort of the puts and takes the pros and cons, the balance feels, well, it\u2019s \u2013 just add a little more balanced. I\u2019ve got some tailwinds in DMs, I got some headwinds in EMs. I\u2019ve got some cost pressure, but you got cost cuts, I\u2019ve got promotional retraction. All these that are the offsets. Is it reasonable to assume that the numbers that were out there before at constant currency are indeed unachievable or is it just at the range of outcomes now? So why that you don\u2019t want to pin yourself down? Dirk Van de Put : I think it is really the latter. Let me give you a little bit of a perspective of where it\u2019s from \u2013 in terms of that. First of all, we are saying nothing around the year. So, saying nothing is saying nothing, it\u2019s not saying something and not wanting to say. It is really, we don\u2019t know at this point in time. But let\u2019s step back for a second, the first quarter was 6.5%. I told you that Q2 might be moderately negative. The average of the two quarters might be \u2013 I don\u2019t know, 3% or so. And again, I\u2019m guessing at this point, I don\u2019t know how long it will take to recover the situation in the second part. But I also told you that there might be a situation where we had to refill the trade. Now I think that is the top line as far as I see it. So there might be \u2013 may be a scenario where we might be close to the original guidance we gave you, which was 3%-plus. Now I don\u2019t expect it to be the 4 or plus percent that we saw in some quarters last year quite frankly. On the bottom line, I think the situation is different. The situation is the following. There are multiple puts and takes. The number one element that comes into play in Q2, and in the second part of the year is the ongoing extra running costs. I think if you take Q2, there will be, as we said very explicitly, some extra cost that we will incur. Now all these costs, most likely will not stay in the second part of the year, some of those will subside, some of those will stay. I think our job is to make sure that between cost savings and between incremental pricing, we create that space into the P&L to be able to invest and to offset part of this cost. So that\u2019s the framework we have in mind. I think again the idea for us is, how do we make all the developing markets, which are the most impacted, recovering with the shape of the curve that we saw in China. That\u2019s the challenge we have today. And we believe we will have to invest some money in the second part of the year, as we have said particularly in working media, to ensure that we protect our franchises and we protect all the share gains that we are seeing. We are winning in this environment. I mean the share gains that we\u2019re seeing at this point in time, I haven\u2019t seen never \u2013 suddenly in Mondelez and those share gains, it is our job to protect and potentially to expand going forward. That I believe the name of the game for us. Jason English : Understood. Thank you very much. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you, Jason. Operator : And your final question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Alexia Howard : Good evening, everyone. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, Alexa. Luca Zaramella : Hi. Alexia Howard : Hi Dirk, thank you for the question. So, just a couple of quick ones from me. Firstly, should we be concerned about European Chocolates in the upcoming couple of quarters? Are you able to give us a rough idea of how much on what proportion of that business is tied to on-the-go impulse type purchases that might be at risk in this kind of environment, where we\u2019re not on-the-go. And then the follow-up question is really, you talked a lot about these share gains in China and that potentially being a patterns of what you\u2019d like to see in other emerging markets. Were the competitors somehow compromised? What \u2013 was it just that you were able to outspend them with a particular channel dynamic? Can you just give us a little bit more on the case study of what happened that was quite successful there? Thank you, and thanks for the question. Dirk Van de Put : Yes, thank you. So Chocolate is doing quite well. Globally in the markets where we play Chocolate is growing at almost double-digit and where it grew mid-single digit in 2019, so Chocolate is also benefiting. Now there are channels, like we mentioned, the World Travel Retail and some of the away-from-home channels, i.e foodservice that are affected by this. But those channels are minor. So in Europe, for instance, 75% of our business is in the retail channel, so benefiting from that growth. Second data point is Easter. We were obviously quite worried about Easter. Easter is a big season for us, and the Chocolate category performed quite well again in the markets where we play. And the growth in the last period, which is the Easter period, the growth was double-digit for the category. And that takes into account the fact that Easter came earlier. So the Easter promotional period was shorter. You had the whole issue with the pandemic, which means less travel, less celebration with family and friends, which is very important. The gifting is very important. And we had the supply chains, which were affected by this. Our teams did an excellent job to get our sales in stores in strong ways, and we delivered record share gains. So in the UK, which is our largest Easter market, we gained over 4 points of share and we now have more than 50% of the Easter period. And even in Australia, where retails \u2013 where we already have very high market share, we gained another 2.5 points during the Easter period. So Easter in the end, we started promoting a little bit earlier, because we were worried that it might not sell-out, but in the end, it did quite well. But because of that promotion, I would say, year-on-year, the Easter period itself deducting the cost of promotion or so is the same as last year, which is an exceptional performance, taking into account all the factors that I said. So we feel pretty good about the Chocolates. It\u2019s a strength. There are areas, as I said, that are minor that are affecting us, but we are still seeing quite solid growth as a company, taking into account even those two channels that we virtually are seeing no sales at the moment. So while where we are, it\u2019s growing 8%, sometimes double-digit, for the company, it\u2019s growing close to about 3% if you deduct those channels that I was talking about. The reason why I think our Chocolate is doing well is that we\u2019re largely in tablets. And tablets are more home consumption than on-the-go consumption. They are family consumption, they are sharing, and those are all important in these circumstances. So I hope that gives you an idea on Chocolate. The second question, I must admit that I forgot the second question, Alexia. Alexia Howard : China. It was the China... Dirk Van de Put : Yes, China, China, yes. Alexia Howard : Yes. With the competitors, what happened? Dirk Van de Put : Yes. So the China situation I think is an effect of a number of things. First of all, our Chinese team took it upon themselves to say that they were not going to let this pandemic affect their performance for the year. And that\u2019s no matter what they were going to deliver the year. And so they went into this with an incredible vengeance, and they were absolutely convinced that they could do whatever they needed to do. So we had situations where there was no delivery trucks where our people loaded the products in their own cars and drove themselves to the stores to deliver. And so the first element is an incredible drive and passion by our Chinese team to make this happen. The second thing, which we see really around the world is that in these situations, consumers are going back to the brands they trust. They want to go to brands that have the image of being high quality that they really sort of have a respect relationship with an Oreo as an example or Pacific have that for us in China. And so we see a shift of consumers abandoning the lesser quality brands that they treat with a little bit more suspicious \u2013 suspicion shifting into the higher quality brand. And there\u2019s a real shift in the Chinese market towards quality. So those for me are the two big reasons that we were able to, in the last period, we gained 7 points of market share. So we do want to now keep on growing on that momentum. I think the consumer is helping us. And we now need to follow-up very quickly. Gum is a little bit less. We\u2019re doing very well. We\u2019re also gaining quite some market share in Gum, but that\u2019s the category which is more on-the-go consumption. And that in China up to recently were still quite affected. People do not \u2013 did not go out that much. The Chinese team tells me that that is changing quite rapidly. Restaurants are open again and so on. But Gum is going a little bit slower, but there also we see the same sort of gains that we are seeing in the Biscuit market for us. Alexia Howard : Perfect. Thank you so much. Appreciate it, and good luck with the second quarter. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Alexia. Dirk Van de Put : I think that\u2019s it, Shep? Shep Dunlap : Yes, that\u2019s it. Dirk Van de Put : Okay. Well, thank you so much for taking some extra time. We went an hour-and-a-half. But in these circumstances, I think that is appropriate. I hope we were able to explain you as much as we could, how we feel about the business and what we are expecting. We of course would prefer to give you a bit more guidance, but it doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s prudent at this stage. There is too many variations at play. But we are convinced of one thing that we will do well seeing the circumstances, and we have a lot of strengths to build on and we are convinced that we will come out of this much stronger and much better than before this crisis. Thank you, and talk to you later. Shep Dunlap : Thank you, everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Mondelez International Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Mondelez' management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to hand the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President, Investor Relations from Mondelez. Please go ahead, sir. Shep Dunlap : Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO; and Luca Zaramella, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the Company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. As we discuss our results today, unless noted as reported, we'll be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures, which adjust for certain items included in our GAAP results. In addition, we provide our year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. You can find the comparable GAAP measures and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of our presentation. In today's call, Dirk will provide a business update then Luca will take you through the financials and our outlook. We will then close with Q&A. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Dirk. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you, Shep. Let me start off by sharing an overview of our Q2 performance on Slide 4. Overall, we are pleased with our results, our business has been resilient, and our execution has been strong. Our first priority remains the safety and wellbeing of our colleagues and our communities as we navigate COVID-19. Because there still are areas of high risk, we are preparing the reopening or already have opened some of our offices around the world. And it is clear that the situation will remain volatile for at least the remainder of the year. Our second priority also remains business continuity. I am very proud of what our colleagues have and are doing to keep our operations running well. Here also, we need to remain vigilant because with the growing number of cases, the risk of business disruption continues to exist around the world. Our overall results for Q2 are good. Despite the fact that COVID has impacted various markets in quite different ways. Our portfolio of trusted brands as well as excellent execution have helped us to weather the high volatility reassuring us that our business fundamentals are solid. Particularly our execution in supply chain as well as our commercial operations have been superior in a very challenging environment. For instance, today, approximately 90% of our plants are running in line or above historical performance. Although we had already good market share momentum going into the crisis, this combination of the strength of our brands and our superior execution have helped to drive unprecedented gains. While the business environment globally remains very volatile, our strategy has proven to be a strength in these difficult circumstances, so we don't see a need to make changes, but we do see opportunities to double down and accelerate certain areas. For instance, due to our current momentum, some overall cost savings and our market share momentum, we are increasing investments in our brands in H2. That virtuous cycle of investment in our brand is an anchor stone of our strategy. Looking at the second half, we expect to see volatility continuing, but we are well positioned for several reasons. Overall snacking tends to be a very resilient category, even in times of recession, meaning we are generally in the right categories. Our brands are some of the most preferred brands in our categories, both local and global. Our geographical footprint is diversified, meaning that while COVID might impact one location, others might be doing better. And finally, our people are responding very well with agility and resilience, and our local-first culture is an advantage in this environment where decision-making needs to be fast and made with the local consumers in mind. Switching to Slide 5. Despite serious challenges caused by COVID effects on trade channels and consumers, we delivered solid results across the board, giving us confidence for sequential improvement in the second half as well as confidence to maintain the course of the strategy we announced almost two years ago. Our revenue growth was 0.7% in Q2 and is 3.7% for the first half. I consider this pretty good given that during the quarter, at one stage or another, every country and many trade channels were in lockdown. There are parts of our business that have slowed down significantly, such as the gum category, world travel retail, away-from-home and the traditional trade channel in some key emerging markets. At the same time, the grocery business in most of the world is well above normal trend. The combination of these two extremes give an almost 1% growth as an average, which we feel good about given the circumstances. Emerging markets were more affected than developed markets and declined in Q2. The good news is that they showed a sequential improvement during the quarter, and they exited the quarter with growth. We are maintaining or gaining share in markets, representing around 85% of our revenues in year-to-date 2020. This is driven by a number of key reasons. We are seeing consumers turning to brands and products they trust. We have many of these trusted brands around the world. Within our category, there is also a shift to segments that are better fit for at-home consumption. So we are stronger in these segments like tablets versus pralines or bars in chocolate. And our supply chain has kept functioning quite well throughout a shortage of labor or lockdowns providing us with a competitive advantage. Our adjusted EPS grew 16.1% in Q2 or 8% for the first half. Luca will provide the details, but despite the extra COVID-related costs, our operating income fell only marginally. Thanks to some offsetting cost-containment activities. We generated very strong cash flow. In the first half, free cash flow was $1.1 billion, and we raised our quarterly dividend by 11%. Transitioning to Slide 6. As mentioned, our long-term strategy does not change. But seeing our current momentum, we are accelerating some initiatives which will allow us to emerge even stronger from this crisis. As it relates to growth strategies, we are planning a significant increase in investments behind working media in the second half, capitalizing on the strength and demand for our brands and built on our increased market share. We are also making adjustment to some of our advertising copy and campaigns to make them more relevant in the current context. Seeing the fact that the consumer is driven more to our core offerings, it is an ideal moment to simplify our portfolio as well as our innovation pipeline to focus on our value-driving core. So we are removing 25% of SKUs which will simplify our supply chain, reduce our cost and inventories and increase our sales and our customer service. With the consumer probably focusing more on value, we are amplifying and accelerating our efforts on revenue growth management, and we believe there is significant potential to capitalize on the increase in e-commerce, particularly with many first timers buying their groceries online. In execution, we were always very cost conscious, but we're taking a fresh look at cost opportunities, reducing in areas like travel and office costs. Costs also benefits from a smaller number of projects and initiatives as well as the reduction of our inventory levels. Out of an abundance of caution, we've decided to only invest CapEx this year in essential projects. And we are accelerating a number of key supply chain initiatives which are aimed at improving our efficiency. Finally, all of these changes are enabled and underpinned by the continued evolution of our culture. Our local-first approach is enabling agile decision-making and adaptation in market. We also see we can evolve the way our people work, helping them with a better balance of life-work. For instance, going forward, we see more people working more time from home. Some of the changes due to COVID will be permanent. So we are redeploying resources to the areas with the highest return opportunities and areas that will be critical post COVID, as an example, e-commerce. Now moving to Slide 7. Despite the current volatile and unpredictable environment, we believe ESG is as important as ever, if not more so, and we remain committed to making progress in this space. In terms of social impact, we have now made cash and in-kind donations of more than $25 million related to COVID-19, through product donations, but also cash support as actions by brands and teams to donate PPE and other essential items. Our responsibility, the communities we operate in has also been highlighted by the recent attention on the racial justice and equality movement. Without question, there is no place for racism in our company or in our society, and it's critically important that we, along with other companies, show measurable action in helping to redress some of the injustices that exist in our society. My leadership colleagues and I have spent time listening to our employee resource groups and colleagues across the business. We've heard that colleagues want actions that are sustainable, impactful and generally make a difference. We want to build on our historical efforts in this area, and so we've organized ourselves across three pillars : colleagues, culture and communities. In our supply chain, we continue to advance our work on creating a sustainable supply of critical ingredients. One of the biggest challenges in this space is deforestation, and the result impact or the resulting impact on CO2. This quarter, we have launched as part of the Consumer Goods Forum, the Forest Positive Coalition with other CPG companies encouraging our suppliers to be more transparent on the land used to grow our ingredients. And finally, we are on track to meet our 2025 goal of 100% recyclable-ready packaging. I am proud of the fact that we've been continuing to work on these critical long-term ESG topics throughout this crisis. And with that, I hand it over to Luca. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Dirk, and good afternoon. Second quarter performance was solid in terms of growth, share gains, earnings and cash flow given the circumstances. We delivered positive revenue growth through a combination of resilient categories and superior execution despite facing significant disruptions and operating restrictions from the crisis. Our developed market continued to perform well, with strength in North America and Europe mass retail, confirming elevated momentum as seen in Q1. Emerging markets were significantly impacted by broad lockdowns, especially during April and into May. Despite this dynamic, we are doing well on a relative basis compared to peers as we are gaining share. I would like to unpack our topline cadence to give you some context of how we ended the quarter, as that might be more indicative than the pure Q2 number. Prior to COVID, we were seeing strong momentum in both developed and emerging markets, and that was both due to snacks categories, momentum and share gains. Once we move into late March and for the month of April, we saw significant divergence between developed and emerging. In developed markets, we saw a spike in consumption. And despite some challenges, our ability to operate was still okay. On the flip side, we enforced lockdowns and curfews in emerging markets. We encountered significant operating restrictions. These markets were most impacted in April with double-digit topline declines as high percentage of outlets were inaccessible to consumers and to us. As a result, total revenue declined low-single digits in April. As we moved into May, things began to improve. And in June, our emerging market turned positive and posted low single-digit growth. We expect this trend of improving growth to continue into July as the majority of these markets are on better footing. We also expect strong demand in North America and Europe mass retail, albeit not as elevated as in H1, but total company is trending better in July than in Q2. Turning to Slide 11. You can see that Q2 revenue growth was driven by positive volume and pricing. This comes despite some significant mix headwinds presented by lower revenue from world travel retail and gum. Biscuits is seeing elevated demand and led growth at more than 9%. Chocolate declined slightly, but this includes three points of headwinds from world travel retail. In addition, chocolate was also impacted by lockdowns in emerging markets, mostly India. It is worth noting that India was nearly flat in May and posted positive growth in June. Gum and candy declined double digit, primarily driven by gum as it skews toward away-from-home consumption and convenience. This channel has seen significantly reduced traffic during the crisis. Turning to category and share highlights on Page 12. Consistent execution, preferred brands and our investments in brands and capabilities continue to drive strong share results. Year-to-date, we have held or gained share in 85% of our revenue base, and our overall share is as high as it has ever been. Biscuits and chocolate drove the overall outcome. More specifically, we gained share in the latest three month period across a number of our biggest markets including U.S. biscuits, Europe, with U.K. and Russia and France standing out; in EMEA, China and Vietnam biscuits, but also Australia, New Zealand and India chocolate; in Latin America, we saw some improvement in Brazil chocolate and powder beverage share, along with Mexico. Our categories held up relatively well with the exception of gum. However, it is important to note that year-to-date category growth of 4.5% doesn't reflect unmeasured channels, such as convenience and world travel retail or the lag effect of some emerging market readings. Now let's review our profitability performance on Slide 13. As expected, our estimated COVID-related costs during the second quarter were more than $100 million, including over time, protective equipment, frontline bonuses, incremental logistics costs and lower cost absorption in emerging markets. Ex this cost, gross profit would have shown solid growth in line with last year's growth rate. In fact, volume leverage in both North America and Europe as well as cost containment efforts across the business enabled us to offset much of this on a gross profit basis as it declined less than $10 million versus previous year. Operating income declined 3.8% for Q2 due to the decline in gross margin, which was partially offset by lower A&C and higher overhead due to COVID as well as the other line impacted by some legal accruals. We continue to expect COVID-related costs in the second half, however, we believe improved leverage and cost mitigation efforts will more than offset these dynamics as we progress through the second half. Especially in Q4, with Q3 still somewhat impacted. Moving to regional performance on Slide 14. North America grew 11% driven by strong share gains and elevated biscuit consumption. Our DSD network continued to demonstrate its value in keeping shelf stock and enabling significant share gains. Gum was down double-digits. North America operating income increased by more than 20%. North America will continue to grow above the historical rates, but we expect lower growth than Q2 as we move throughout the year. Europe revenue declined 1.2% in the quarter. Headwinds from world travel retail, which was a drag of 2.5 percentage points as well as gum and the instant consumption channels, drove this dynamic. We saw strength and good execution in several key markets, including mass retail which grew high-single digits, and in chocolate, where we posted significant share gains in the U.K., in France, in Russia and Benelux. Although we expect continued challenges in world travel retail, we are more constructive on the state of convenience and traditional trade, which are expected to be much less of a headwind in the second half. We saw improved exit rate in June and good growth into July. Overall, we expect EU to return to growth in Q3, unless there is a material COVID relapse. Adjusted OI dollars declined as a result of significant COVID costs and unfavorable mix. These results should improve as we progress through the second half of the year. AMEA declined 3.1% with conditions that vary greatly by market. China continued to recover, growing double-digits. Southeast Asia grew mid-single digits. India declined double-digit due to significant lockdowns and store closures in April and May before it turning to mid single-digit growth in June. As we move into the second half, and based on the dynamics we see today, we are expecting this improvement to continue, unless there are additional shutdowns in key markets. AMEA operating income dollars declined by approximately 5%, due primarily to lower-than-typical volume leverage and additional COVID-related expenses. AMEA executed well on cost containment actions. Latin America decreased 11% due to traditional trade disruptions in most of the key markets, while Argentina posted growth due to inflation-driven pricing. Ex Argentina, Latin America declined by 15%. Mexico declined low-double digits due to a significant decline in gum and candy. In Brazil, we declined high-single digits due to significant disruptions in traditional trade. Our Western Andean countries, which were among the most impacted by COVID, also declined. We did see improving share trends in several notable markets. Adjusted OI dollars in Latin America declined by 78%, primarily due to headwinds associated with negative mix, under absorption and an accrual for a legal-related matter that accounted for one third of the decline versus previous year. We expect the environment in Latin America to remain challenging in the second half given the restrictions in place in most markets and the impact that those restrictions are having on economic growth. We remain focused on what we can control, which is executing our plans and driving better share performance. Now turning to earnings per share on Slide 18. Q2 EPS grew 16%. Operating gains in the quarter were impacted by COVID costs, which were north of $100 million which means more than $0.07 impact. I'll now move on to our free cash flow on Slide 19. We delivered free cash flow of $1.1 billion in the first half. Strong working capital discipline was a big driver as we improved our cash conversion cycle by eight days. We also had deferred tax payment for more than $200 million, which will mostly reverse in the second half as well as lower CapEx and cash restructuring. Our priorities for the remainder of the year stay clear, and we will continue to be disciplined. I wanted to provide some thoughts on our joint ventures, specifically our participation in the successful IPO of JDE Peet's. Prior to transaction, we exchanged our JV investments for an investment in JDE Peet's. JDE Peet's then went public for \u20ac31.50 per share at the end of May. The stock now trades at around \u20ac38 per share, which places the value of our stake at approximately $5 billion. This was a great result as it provides more flexibility and a public bar for this financial investment. Moving to Slide 22. As previously disclosed, due to the COVID pandemic, visibility remains limited at this time in a number of key markets. As a result, we are not providing a full-year financial outlook. However, we continue to expect the following for 2020. An effective tax rate in the low- to mid-20s; adjusted interest expense of approximately $380 million; and we now expect exchange translation to negatively impact our reported revenue by 3% and EPS by $0.05 based on current market rate. Although we're not providing full-year guidance at this time, I wanted to share some thoughts regarding how the second half will play out. We expect improving conditions in many markets that experienced significant store closures in late Q1 and Q2. In-home consumption is expected to be at elevated levels, which is helpful in developed markets such as North America. And we expect to make critical investments behind our brands to continue to drive momentum on a relative basis. On the flip side, we expect the negative impact to continue in some emerging markets, mostly in Latin America. World travel retail is expected to continue its negative trend. And although there is no way to know exactly how the pandemic will evolve, there will always be a potential for a second wave of shutdowns. In aggregate, we expect positive revenue and the sequential improvement in the third quarter based on what we see through month one of Q3. With that, let's open it up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Kenneth Goldman : Hi. Thank you, and good afternoon, everybody. Two for me, if I can. I wanted to first touch on your share gains. Some of these gains, I think, are due to your North America supply chain, which obviously is quite advantaged and some perhaps due to your competitor struggles globally. But you did highlight some brand strength, other positive factors in your prepared remarks. So just as you think about your expectations for market share in the back half of the year, can you walk us through what you think some of the more sustainable drivers are. I'm guessing higher marketing spend is one of them. And maybe what drivers could back off a little bit versus the first half. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, Ken. Yes, sure, with pleasure. If I maybe explain where are the share gains happening and then go a little bit into the drivers and then in what we think will happen. First of all, as we said in the presentation, we've gained share in 85% of our revenue base, so it's very broad-based. It is in biscuits. It's in chocolate. It's across the geographies, I would say, almost in every single market around the world and certainly not important markets. We see significant market share increase. For instance, biscuits China, biscuits U.S., biscuits in France, but also chocolate in the UK, chocolate Australia, chocolate India. And we also see it across smaller categories. So it's very widespread. And on top of it, we see that it's our global and our local brands. It's not just one brand. It's across our brand. And one of the interesting factors that our penetration of our brand is increasing overall, and also that we see some very good repeat of those new users. So what is the reason? I think fundamentally, during the COVID crisis there, there are three. First of all, as you alluded to, we have had a very good performing supply chain around to market. You could sort of say that not only in the U.S., but in other markets, we increased our share of the distribution points. Not so much because we increased our distribution, but customer service level and our on-shelf availability was better than our competition. And so for instance, in the U.S. or in other markets around the world, DSD is a key advantage. The other one is that we usually have sort of the strongest brands in our categories around the world. And consumers have been going back to the brands they know and trust. And so an Oreo, as an example, or a Milka or some of the other local brands that we have, have clear consumer trust. And we see that's why we see all of them increasing their share also. And then within snacking, if you look at it sort of category by category, we are in those segments within the categories that are benefiting from at-home consumption. For instance, tablets in chocolate do better than bars or better than pralines. And in biscuits, it's your more traditional biscuits that is a segment where the consumer is going to. I would say these are the three big drivers. When will they go away? Well, it's difficult to say. Supply chain, I assume that everybody is catching up on their supply chain. Although with what we are seeing in the U.S. and some other places around the world, having your supply chain perform is not as simple as it might sound. I do think that this trend to go to bigger brands and more known brands is here to stay for a while. And then the mix with the in-home consumption, I think that's going to last for a while, too. We are now clearly talking about this change to our lives continuing well into 2021. I would also like to point out that we have momentum before the crisis. We were already increasing our market share before this started. And so underlying, there is a fundamental share increase that was taking place. I also think the repeat rates of our brands of the new users, that's important to notice. And then I talked about that increase in working media with significant increases in the second half of the year, which should also give a good pull on our brand. And then I think what we're doing with our business, simplifying everything, eliminating SKUs, going to fewer innovations, all that will give us even more strength in execution. So overall, I'm pretty optimistic. I think that a big part of this market share will stick. Kenneth Goldman : That's helpful. Thank you. And then quickly on my follow-up, speaking of the higher marketing spending, you talked about in the third quarter I know you're not giving guidance today, but I wanted to poke it a little bit into what you were talking about to make sure I understood. You talked about better revenue into the third quarter, and you've talked about some simplification of the business. But you've also talked about ramping up your marketing spending, like I said. So just trying to get a sense among all these factors and maybe some that I'm missing. Is it reasonable to expect improved operating income in the third quarter as well in addition to better revenue? And the reason I'm asking is The Street's modeling an increase year-on-year in your third quarter EBIT. Is this reasonable given what you know right now? Or is it really just too early to say? Luca Zaramella : I can maybe I\u2019ll\u2026 Dirk Van de Put : Maybe Luca, you want to take this one? Yes. Luca Zaramella : Yes, I'll. Welcome back Ken. Nice to have you again on\u2026 Kenneth Goldman : It's good to be back. Thank you. Luca Zaramella : Yes. Look, I believe it is a little bit premature to give you a precise number here, but we gave you a few indications in the prepared remarks for Q3 enough to simply said, we expect North America to continue with increased momentum. Certainly, we are not going to see as high of a number as we saw in Q2. Having 11% topline was fairly exceptional and 20-plus percent OI. Europe is expected to return to growth overall despite world travel retail. And I would expect, for sure, better profitability and better leverage. Some of the COVID costs will subside. AMEA as well is expected to return to growth in Q2 in Q3. And there should be, again, lower COVID cost and better volume outcomes. Latin America is, quite frankly, expected to meaningfully improve, particularly on the OI line into Q3, but we are not going to see necessarily a positive year-on-year profit. So I would say that overall topline for Mondelez in Q3 is expected to be better than Q2. As we look at July, we see good numbers coming in at this point in time. But obviously, I have to make a disclosure here, which is that is absent a material relapse or issue in one of the biggest market or in more than one. As far as bottom line is concerned, I think there will be a sequential improvement in Q3 from where we see today. Whether it will be all the way to bright, I am not sure as there will still be some COVID-related cost and all the actions we are putting in place actually will come into full fruition in Q4. So you will see some improvements in Q3, but you will see even more in Q4 from what we see today. Kenneth Goldman : That's helpful. Thanks so much. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Ken. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please go ahead, sir. Andrew Lazar : Great. Thanks very much. Dirk, with some concern over economic recession in some key emerging markets, can you remind us of, I guess, Mondelez ability to manage through these sorts of macro events in terms of down trading, unit pricing and such. And the reason I ask is with global category growth year-to-date up around 4.5% and Mondelez holding or gaining share in 85% of categories. I guess, what realistically would hold Mondelez back at this stage from delivering at least 3% organic growth for the year, even if global category growth slows a bit from here, let's say, due to some recession? Dirk Van de Put : Yes, I can \u2013 first of all, good to hear you, Andrew. And yes, I can certainly explain that a little bit better. First of all, as it relates to that 4.5% growth in categories, those are the measured categories. And as we, for instance, explained world travel retail is not included in the measured channels and some of the foodservice and so on. So we think that overall, the category growth is not the 4.5% seen that those are the channels that are more severely affected by COVID. As it relates to our categories and our strategy in the recession, I would say that, first of all, we look back at history, and the history has shown that over biscuits and chocolate tend to be quite durable in a downturn in developed markets, but also in emerging markets. And in fact, biscuits, in general, are not affected by the recession, and actually sometimes accelerated during the recession because, again, there is this switch to more in-home consumption which biscuits benefit from. Chocolate is a little bit more of a mixed picture. Some markets, it went down. Some markets, it went up. But overall, I would say it's also quite resilient with a very fast recovery as the recession starts to fade away. Candy was solid, very little change, and it's gum that suffers in a recession in our case, as we currently are seeing, but that's more driven by the fact that gum is an on-the-go product and that a lot of these channels have been closed. But also in a recession since, again, there's more in-home consumption, gum suffers. As it relates to the price points, I think we've done a good job around the world. I'm thinking India or Brazil or Mexico of overall, making our products quite affordable and covering all the price points. And I think we are set up now to really play in the different segments that you will see. Another thing, I think, that's important in our categories as it relates to a recession, is that private label penetration, particularly in emerging markets, is very limited compared to other food categories. So let's say that we were expecting the categories to grow about 3% pre-crisis. It maybe that they slowed down slightly. But I think together with our market share gains and the opportunities that we have as it relates to adjacencies to our categories, we should be able to get to that level as you were talking about. I also think internally, we are stronger. We have invested more in our brands. I think our brands today are stronger than they were two, three years ago. We are modernizing our portfolio. We have communications that are more effective. Execution is good. In the past, our execution was maybe sometimes not as great. Now supplies in North America is an example for us. And so I don't see us as a company not being able to deal with the recession. I think we can enter it with a position of strength as it relates to execution and being present. And so I believe that overall, we have work to do, don't get me wrong. For instance, we are working quite hard on what we call revenue growth management to make sure that we get the right price points completely squared away. A lot of price pack architecture, understanding what will happen in the different channels, so all the business units are hard at work to prepare for that. But I do think that we are set up to do well. And if we can keep the momentum going on our market share, I would agree with you. I don't see a reason why we cannot deliver against our long-term algorithm. Andrew Lazar : Thank you so much. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Dara Mohsenian : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Luca Zaramella : Hi, Dara. Dirk Van de Put : Hi. Dara Mohsenian : So clearly strong organic sales growth in the U.S. in the quarter, can you unpack how much of that was true sort of underlying demand at retail? Was there any retailer inventory build? Or was this more strong retail sales growth? And just the sustainability of that sales growth going forward given it look like U.S. trend slowed a bit sequentially in the scattered data towards the end of the quarter would be helpful. Luca Zaramella : Yes. Maybe I'll\u2026 Dirk Van de Put : Okay. Luca Zaramella : No, go on Dirk. Dirk Van de Put : Okay. Well, I would say that the reason of the increased sales in the U.S. is driven by the Biscuit segment, and the Biscuit segment is heavily influenced by in-home consumption. And as long as the consumer will be more at-home and more consuming at-home, I think we will see an increase in our sales in the U.S. versus previous year. Of course, in the beginning, at the start of the crisis, there was some \u2013 a little bit of pantry loading, but that is out of the equation now. So what we are seeing now is continued consumption, I would say. And I would expect that sort of foreseeable future, not a change in that in-home consumption phenomenon. Now to be clear, gum is a contrary of that. It's very negatively impacted by that in-home consumption. It skews out-of-home, it's on-the-go consumption. And so that's going to be lower during the crisis. As it relates to the trade, if anything, I would say that the trade inventories at the moment are low because it has been difficult to keep up with demand. We significantly have reduced our assortment of SKUs just to provide a good customer service. And so if anything, I would say as our demand would slowdown a little bit, that will give us an opportunity to bring the trade stocks back in line with where they should be. So from my perspective, I feel pretty strong, certainly about Q3 and Q4 in U.S., I don't really expect, it might slowdown a little bit, but we\u2019re still in high single-digit growth rates, to my opinion, which is much better than it was in the past. Luca, go ahead. Luca Zaramella : No. I second all the points you made. And to be \u2013 by transparent as we usually are, where we can be \u2013 trade stock is lower in the U.S. than it used to be. And it is not the only place where we have lower trade stock. And just to give you another data point, you're absolutely right, that there was a little bit of a slowdown in consumption, but as we look at some of the numbers we have for July, it feels like there is still opportunities for us to grow as Dirk says in the high single-digit territory. So we feel good about what we see. As Dirk pointed out, it is true that gum is a little bit on a downtrend at the moment, but I would also say that it is sequentially improving. And the last point I'd like to make is, particularly in candies like Swedish Fish and Sour Patch, we are seeing quite a bit of growth at the moment as well. So all is pointing in the direction of continued momentum, albeit it might not be the 11% that you saw in Q2, might be a little bit lower. Dara Mohsenian : Great. Thanks guys. It's very helpful. Operator : And the next question is from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. John Baumgartner : Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. Luca Zaramella : Hi, John. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, John. John Baumgartner : Dirk or I guess, Luca \u2013 how are you doing? I guess what aspect of your revenue growth story over time is that penetration rates across emerging markets are still low and the white space opportunity can be still fairly impactful. So in the context of the fallout from COVID, to what extent is that kind of creating delays against the plan to enter new points of distribution or causing you to reprioritize your growth drivers over the next year or so? Dirk Van de Put : At this stage, it doesn't feel to us that we need to reprioritize. We feel that a lot of the slowdown that you've seen in emerging markets has really gone directly related to the COVID crisis, and the fact that consumers were already locked down or distributors couldn't operate or the stores were closed. And as we open up the channels, we will see through which levels we go back. If I would take India as an example, India, of course, in April was not that great. I mean May was back to flat versus last year, and in June, started to show a low single-digit growth versus last year. In July, they will be higher than that. Will India go back to double-digit growth in the coming months? Maybe not, but if India delivers us a 6%, 7%, 8% topline growth, that's more than enough for us to keep on going on our plan. We were planning to expand our distribution in India for the year in hundred thousand stores or more. We probably had to slow that down a little bit during the COVID crisis, but we are planning to pick it right up where we left it off and keep on growing. At this stage \u2013 and India is an example for what we see in other countries. So for me at this stage, there is no reason to change our strategy. We might have, at this stage, maybe a quarter of delay, but we will try to catch up as much as we can. And certainly for 2021, we are planning to keep on going in the direction that we had set. John Baumgartner : Thanks, Dirk. Thanks for your time. Dirk Van de Put : Okay. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please go ahead. Christopher Growe : Hi, good afternoon. Luca Zaramella : Hi, Chris. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, Chris. Christopher Growe : Hi, guys. I just had two quick questions sort of related, but I'm just curious, we know that the gum category was a pretty significant detractor from the quarter, the world travel retail and away-from-home. Can you say how much of those were dragging on revenue in the quarter? And then, I guess somewhat related, I'm curious if you look at \u2013 you defined the COVID costs, you also I think have indicated there's been some benefits from leverage and some of your own expense control to overcome that. Where would net COVID costs come off of the quarter, if you were to kind of put that against the savings you realized in the quarter? Thank you. Luca Zaramella : Yes. I'll start and then\u2026 Dirk Van de Put : I think that sounds one for you, Luca. Luca Zaramella : Yes. I'll take these. So Chris, I think you know that gum is around about 7% of our revenue and there was a material decline in Q2. It was in the tune of, I would say, 35%, 40% in total, depending on the market. It is somewhat driven by share, but 80% of it is due to market, quite frankly. The market is really being impacted by all these shutdowns. And we are told that it is very difficult to do with the mask as well in certain places. So we saw a little bit of an issue in that market. Having said that, as we look at July, we see it coming better. I called it out in the U.S., but it is also in other markets. I can tell you one notable one for us is, is China. In Latin America though, we still see a bit of a continued challenge particularly in Mexico and Andean. Then world travel retail, it is give or take, $0.25 billion business for the year and it was nearly zero in Q2. We expect it to improve particularly towards Q4, but it was a material drag. We called out in the prepared remarks, both the impact on Europe and chocolate, and it is 2.5, 3 points of a drag both on Europe, which declined 1% plus. So you can do the math of how much Europe grew, excluding world travel retail. And the same on chocolate that was almost flat, but it would have been much better. So as we look forward, as I said, we feel quite good about Europe in Q3. Europe was another one that was impacted a little bit by trade and stock in Q2 as well. So we see that coming a little bit back in Q3. And importantly in chocolate, across the board, we see a quite solid category growth at this point and share as well. The biggest differential in chocolate is going to be India coming back. And as I said, India closed the quarter in June in good growth territory. And as we look at July specifically, India is quite solid. So we would expect India to be in a good growth territory in Q3. So that gives you a little bit a sense of these headwinds and how they impacted the quarter for us. Christopher Growe : That was great. Luca Zaramella : On the COVID\u2026 Christopher Growe : Yes. Thank you. Luca Zaramella : So the COVID costs, look we had more than $100 million in the GP line, and we have another $20 million, $25 million in the overhead line. So I would call it for lack of a better number, $130 million plus of an impact. We did cut travel, clearly, but the biggest upside both in terms of switching from non-working media to working media, other promotional spending items, some cost containment actions that we are taking in our factories. They had an impact that if I had to guess it would be around about $20 million in Q2. The big upside for all these actions is going to come in the second part of the year and specifically in Q4. I think you will see in Q4 this cost savings being meaningful and total profit being materially better than it is today or in Q3 for that matter. Both because this will come to fruition also because the COVID-related cost in Q4 will subside in our current outlook. So we will see what those costs are exactly, but that's the \u2013 how we see things at the moment. Christopher Growe : Okay. That was very good color. Thank you for that. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Chris. Operator : You have the next question from Bryan Spillane, again with Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : Hey. Good afternoon, everyone. Luca Zaramella : Hi, Bryan. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, Bryan. Bryan Spillane : Hi. So I just wanted to go back to \u2013 I think it might be related to John Baumgartner's question. But Dirk, you \u2013 in the prepared remarks, you talked about SKU reduction and also, I guess a slowing of some of the new product introduction. So just wanted to know a) is that more of a near-term response? Would the SKU reduction at all in the near-term create any kind of drag on revenues? But then more kind of longer term, how does that square with the presentation you made at CAGNY, where you talked about channel expansion, adjacent categories as part of the growth agenda. So just trying to square a kind of SKU reduction and fewer new product introductions with how that sort of relates to the growth \u2013 you've presented back at CAGNY. Dirk Van de Put : Yes. Well, in a nutshell, it's all part of the same thinking. The way I would try to explain it is that if you look at our business, we have an opportunity to simplify our business and my experience in many other consumer goods companies is that in general, what has happened over the years is that people are chasing growth. And as a consequence, they keep on launching new products. And that gives you a short-term benefit. But at the certain stage, you need to clean that up. You need to look at your SKUs. You need to take a look at your innovation pipeline, and sometimes also at your brands and say, can these be simpler. But it's always a big discussion because the teams feel uncomfortable doing it. Although if you maintain the same shelf space, and I've done it several times in my career, what you will see is that not only do your sales increase because now the best selling items get more space. Your supply chain costs go down because of longer runs, less changeover, less inventory, less waste, and it also has a big benefit on your cash. So it's a good exercise to do. Just to think about us having thousands of SKUs, and every year, a few thousands of innovation projects, a lot of small ones, and to be frank it's \u2013 we were looking for a reason to break this chain because we do believe there is a much better way to do this. The reason why we want to do it now, we want to reaccelerate it now is that, I would say, the stars have lined up. The clients want great customer service. They want a cleaner shelf. They want to make sure that they can serve their customers. And we have the same initiative. So we were already obliged in this crisis to work with a much smaller set of SKUs in order to make sure that the key SKUs are on the shelf. And what do we see? Our sales are better, the shelf looks cleaner, and we get some benefits from it. So we're kind of pushing through using the opportunity to say, this is the moment we do it. Those 25% SKUs represent less than 2% of our sales. And I think we will see no effect from taking them out. Now it's not in one go. This takes a while. It's going to run over a few months. And we probably \u2013 out of those 25% of SKUs, somewhere at the beginning of next year. That doesn't mean that we will not do channel expansion and adjacency. The 25% is net. It means that we will launch a number of new items, particularly focused on price pack architecture to hit those price points that we need in specific channels and specific sizes for channels, or we needed because of the revenue growth management that we are applying. And we also will launch a number of items in adjacencies. So the 25% is net of all that. So I see it as part of the same strategy, and I'm really looking forward to be at the other end of this because I think we will have a much cleaner SKU portfolio, a much cleaner innovation portfolio, and hopefully, we can also clean up a few brands, so that we're lean as a company at the end of this. Bryan Spillane : That's great. Thanks for the clarity, Dirk. It really ties it together. Thanks again. Dirk Van de Put : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Alexia Howard : Good afternoon, everyone. Luca Zaramella : Hi. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, Alexia. Alexia Howard : Hi, Dirk. So a couple of questions for me. Firstly, you called out the negative mix impact of, I think, minus 2.6% this time. Could you help us understand what was driving that and whether that headwind is expected to continue into the second half? And then my second question is just around the e-commerce dynamics. As we think about the U.S., Europe and China, how fast is e-commerce breaking out in each of those areas? And do you expect that to continue? Thank you. And I'll pass it on. Dirk Van de Put : Maybe Luca, you do the first one on the mix and I'll do e-commerce. Luca Zaramella : Absolutely. Let's do that. Let's team up here. So on the negative mix impact, 100% of it is attributable to two categories, I would say, world travel retail, which is a business that has quite good margins. We sell predominantly Toblerone there, which is a great brand with quite solid gross margin, and that's the number one driver. And the other one is the gum category that, as I called out before, it declined 35%, 40%. I said about world travel retail that it was almost zero in the quarter, so I expect an improvement, particularly in Q4 around that business. And equally for gum, I expect a material improvement, particularly as we exit the year. I'm not sure it will improve dramatically in Q3. But certainly, as the situation stabilizes and trade starts to be open particularly in emerging markets, I mean traditional trade. We expect to see a gradual improvement compared to the current declines in gum. So the mix situation should improve throughout the year. And it has always been a fairly neutral number for us, I would say, as some emerging markets have a little bit of lower margins than some of the developed markets. And I was happy we were keeping it in control quite well. Obviously, gum and world travel retail are a little bit of a driver at this point in time. Dirk Van de Put : And then to link in with e-commerce. So the number on e-commerce are a growth of 91% in Q2, so e-commerce last year was about 3% of our net revenue. In Q1 of this year, it was 3.5%, and in Q2, it's 6%. The biggest increase we saw was in the U.S., close to 200% increase. And that was driven by the fact that people that already shopped online bought more online, but also a significant amount of first timers that started to buy their groceries online. And so the penetration of last year of e-commerce went from 4% to 9%. So we do expect that e-commerce will remain a large part of our U.S. business after the crisis. The growth rates are high across all platforms, click and collect and delivery. And also our market share we gained, for instance, about four points of market share in biscuits online. And so we had already a good momentum before the crisis, and we've doubled down. Of course in click and collect, since we had a very strong performance of our DSD operation and since they picked the products out of the store that has helped our performance. As we go to Europe, we're talking about growth in UK and France, which was 100% and 50%, respectively, so also very, very strong growth. And China, where e-commerce is already 18% of our sales, we had a growth of 20%, which is consistent with the growth that we saw in 2019. The penetration there is already very high compared to our other markets around the world. In fact, if I reflect on e-commerce, I think we've got good momentum. We are increasing our market shares. We have some PPA gaps. We cannot yet always offer the consumer the sizes at the prices that they want. So we will continue to launch e-commerce specific packs, which is a little bit more difficult in click and collect. And we are also further investing in people and in infrastructure. So overall, we see very strong momentum in e-commerce. Alexia Howard : Wonderful. Thank you very much. I will pass it on. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jason English : Hello and good evening folks. Luca Zaramella : Hi, Jason. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, Jason. Jason English : Thank you so much for squeezing in. I very much appreciated. I wanted to come back to the productivity comments, and it sounds like you have a lot of initiatives under way. Obviously cutting 25% of SKUs and the impacts on your supply chain can be quite robust. I think your productivity has been tracking south of 2%, net productivity fell up to 2% of COGS the last year or two. A) Is that right? And b) as we think about the sort of run rate into the fourth quarter, where do you think that figure's going to fall by the time we hit the fourth quarter. Luca Zaramella : Yes. Maybe I'll comment on this, and then Dirk can chip in. I think you got the number on about right. There have been quarters where the number has been a little bit higher, quarters where the number has been a little bit lower. And remember, the impact that is due to what we call supply chain reinvention is a little bit lower than it has been in the past. We count on volume leverage above all to get our productivities stepping up. We count on other small changes that we're going to make in some places and bigger one and others. And we count on this concept of continuous improvement. We have a new leader in supply chain, and she has developed quite a bit of a strategy. And I think we have what it takes to continue to deliver profit through productivity. To your point, obviously, when you look at some of the numbers across the board, you can realize that productivity in Latin America this quarter wasn't great because of clear volume declines. And if you talk about productivities, including COVID costs, productivities haven't been great in Q2 overall as we had to incur additional cost. You will see an improvement in Q3. And in Q4, you will see a full effect of COVID costs coming down quite a bit. And also on the flip side, you will see material cost savings that we are about to implement, and we have, for some part already implemented in terms of tightening the belt, not only in the supply chain, but also in the overhead area, so all of this should come to maximum fruition in Q4. Jason English : Okay. I guess what I was really angling at was it sounds like you're going to have a very large productivity year in 2021. Because if you hit the run rate in 4Q, that's a modest spillover. And it sounds like some of these initiatives. You're not even going to have fully impacted until you bleed into the early next year. So I'm going to try one more time to come back at that number. That legacy sort of 2%, what do you think it might look like next year in context of all these initiatives? Luca Zaramella : Look, it should be better than quite honestly, than that number. That is the expectation, obviously. Having said that, we don't know exactly how Q3 and Q4 will play out, imagine about 2021. But do we expect by lapping some of these extra COVID costs and the fact that, as you pointed out correctly, we are having a spillover impact into next year of all these cost savings. Do we expect the benefit? Yes, absolutely. I think the counter to that is, in some cases, a little bit of more inflation around certain cost areas. But overall, the simple straight answer is, do we expect that the productivities next year? At this point, I would say so. Jason English : Yes. Thank you very much. Luca Zaramella : You're welcome, Jason. Operator : And your final question is from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead sir. David Palmer : Thanks. And thanks for your earlier comments on Europe. It sounds like the trade shipment timing and the travel channel each hurt the second quarter organic revenue. You made also a comment. I think it was an answer to a question that you would get back to growth in the third quarter. Is that because of the shift in retail inventory? Or is there other consumer or channel trends that are giving you confidence into the second half in Europe? Dirk Van de Put : Yes. I would say that in Europe, if you exclude because for historical reasons, we've always added world travel retail into our European numbers. And so the number you've always seen includes world travel retail. Now world travel retail in this quarter is virtually zero because there was the duty free shops were closed. If you take that out, Europe was already growing low single-digit but it was growing. The reason why it was not higher than low single-digit is that they have a number of other channels, particularly foodservice, and impulse, so convenience, which are about 20% together with world travel retail of their sales, they were affected by the lockdowns and the consumer not being out and about. Europe is going back to normal, better than what we're seeing in North America. So we are seeing gradually those two channels coming back. We're even expecting world travel retail to start showing a little bit of sales in Q3. So that's really the effect we're talking about and why we feel that Europe will show positive numbers, including world travel retail going forward. David Palmer : And then just on products line \u2013 go ahead. Sorry, Luca. Luca Zaramella : And if I may maybe add one thing. I think the other thing that is more predominant now is our share gains and share gains are expanding in Europe in the latest region. So we see a benefit coming out of share and chocolate consumption as we look at Q3 is going to be quite good. So as Dirk said, there is a little bit of trade stock repiping, there is a little bit of an improvement in all these channels that created a headwind in Q3. But importantly, the underlying consumption in the rest of the business, due mostly to share, and I would say also solid category is improving in Q3 from where we sit today. David Palmer : And I think you just touched on it a little bit. I'm just wondering about the profit or the leverage line to this organic revenue. You said COVID costs and mix headwinds leading to that negative 11 or how much are those headwinds going away into the second half for that segment? Or do you expect that this topline growth will lead to a bottom line growth as well? Luca Zaramella : In relative terms, the supply chain in Europe has been the most impacted by COVID extra costs. You will still see an impact in Q3. And so profit will be better in Q3. Again, it won't be all the way to bright. You will see a much better profit number again from where we sit today and what we see into Q4 at this point in Q4. So there is a material cost. We have multiple plants that serve multiple countries in Europe. So logistically, it is more difficult for people to get into the plant as they come, in some cases across the borders. And it is more difficult as there was in some places, a little bit of higher absenteeism that we still see to a certain extent. And importantly, some of the cost that we saw to protect all our people have been for one reason or the other a little bit higher than Europe, and so you will still see an impact in Q3. David Palmer : Got it. Thank you very much. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, David. Operator : And there are no further questions in queue at this time. I would like to turn the call back to our speakers for closing remarks. Dirk Van de Put : Well, thank you for connecting. And I think I can wrap it up by saying, from our perspective, it was a solid Q2, particularly seeing the circumstances that we faced around the world. We exited the quarter with very good momentum, and we see a confirmation of that momentum in July. We have the fuel to invest in our growth within our P&L for the second half, and so we feel very confident that we will exit 2020 with some strength and are heading for a great 2021 also. So thank you again, and looking forward to talk to you in the coming quarters. Luca Zaramella : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Mondelez International Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Mondelez' management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondelez. Please go ahead, sir. Shep Dunlap : Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO; and Luca Zaramella, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website, mondelezinternational.com/investors. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the Company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. As we discuss our results today, unless noted as reported, we'll be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures, which adjust for certain items included in our GAAP results. In addition, we provide our year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. You can find the comparable GAAP measures and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of our slide presentation. In today's call, Dirk will provide a business update then Luca will take you through the financials and our outlook. We will then close with Q&A. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Dirk. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you, Shep, and good afternoon. We are very encouraged by our performance in the third quarter. Our execution was strong. We continue to accelerate our strategic initiatives and all of our regions were in growth. Our teams have been resilient and focused and we continued to prioritize safety during Q3, as we will for the remainder of the year. We continue to manage successfully through uncertainty and COVID-related challenges. And as a consequence we are outperforming our categories, continuing to gain significant market share. While our category outperformance is in most markets around the world that are very diverging markets in category situations, depending on how they are affected by COVID dynamics. Our largest categories biscuits and chocolate continue to perform well. Gum is still under significant pressures due to changes in consumer mobility and habits. And Candy while initially under pressure also improved. Meals and powdered beverages continue to do as well. Demand remained elevated in developed markets and we saw sequential improvement in emerging markets. In developed markets where more of our business is in the grocery channel and our Gum business is also smaller, we continue to be good momentum. In emerging markets, the majority of our markets grew in Q3, including key markets such as India, China, Brazil and Russia. But conditions do vary and some markets are still challenged, particularly where our portfolio skews towards gum and candy or where our sales are mostly in the traditional trade, which is mainly in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. Our long-term growth strategy remains unchanged. But during this crisis we have accelerated certain initiatives in order to emerge stronger and build further on our advantage position. First, we are simplifying our business in order to facilitate more growth and reduce costs. Examples of this would be SKU deduction and innovation streamlining. Second, we are accelerating a number of growth initiatives in order to maintain our momentum and build on our share gains. For instance, in H2 we are increasing investment in our brands and commercial capabilities. We've also focused more on momentum in e-commerce and the grocery channel. Third, in order to offset some of the extra COVID-related cost, we have advantage or advanced a number of strategic cost reduction initiatives. We also prioritizing stronger between CapEx projects. And forth, we are rolling out changes in our ways of working and optimizing our organization structures, while strengthening some new more required capabilities. Switching out to slide five. Q3 was a strong quarter across all key metrics. We delivered organic net revenue growth of 4.4%. We are holding or gaining share in over 80% of our revenue base. We had good momentum on share coming into the pandemic. And I'm satisfied that we have sustained share gains beyond the initial phase of the crisis. This demonstrates the strength of our brands and our supply chain. Our gross profit dollars grew strongly at 6%, despite the incremental COVID-related costs. An operating income grew strongly at 10.5%, despite the significant increase in our brand investments. And last, we continue to improve free cash flow generation delivering $1.7 billion year to date, up $0.5 billion versus the same period last year. I'm now on slide six. As stated we continue to believe that our growth strategy is the right one for this environment. Not only do we believe that our strategy is the right one, we have the ambition to emerge from this crisis even stronger than we were before. To do so, we are accelerating certain areas of investment and other initiatives within the current strategy in light of the current dynamics. Let me highlight a few of these areas where we are making strong progress. We are stepping up working media investments behind our brands in the second half of this year. This is possible because we decreased our investments during the second quarter when because of all the issues arising when this crisis just started, it did not make sense to invest. We are seeing good results from this increase in investment, for example, as one proof point, our market share momentum continued in Q3. Also our ROI on these investments has increased significantly. We now ranked in the Top Tier in our industry. An interesting to note is that we are skewing are spent digital even more. For the first time this year we will be spending more on digital than on TV. Another area of great progress is brand equity increases. Our marketing team have successfully adapted our brand communication to the circumstances, some of it is focused on purpose and human connections, others on staying playful while staying at home or some others are about reinforcing hygiene practices. As a consequence our brands are forging stronger connections with our consumers really connecting through their purpose. In another area we are on track to be 75% through our SKU reduction exercised by year-end. Our teams are focused on ensuring, we don't know shelf space or incurred too much waste while increasing sales, reducing inventory and increasing line efficiency. I do want to reiterate that while 25% SKU reduction sounds like a big number, this represents a very small percentage of our revenue. The fourth highlight is that we have successfully implemented cost mitigation programs that we expect to fully offset the COVID-related costs we incur in the second half of the year. While this helps to deliver an on-algorithm year this year, it also supports our plans to continue to increase our investment in brands and capabilities again next year, while continuing to deliver against our financial algorithm. As it relates to our new ways of working, the company is functioning very well in this new reality, with most of our office associates working from home for the foreseeable future. We've also optimized our organization, shifting people to where we need them most like e-commerce,, digital or RGM. Switching to slide seven. While the COVID crisis has been all absorbing, we are continuing to progress even enhance our ESG agenda. This quarter, three areas got particular attention. First of all, we are focused on and making progress against the enhanced diversity and inclusion commitments we made in September. I am particularly pleased with our recent appointment of a New Global Chief Diversity and Inclusion officer, Robert Perkins. Robert will help us increase minority representation in our business, and advise me, my team and the broader company on how to take further action to drive an even more inclusive culture at Mondelez. As it relates to sustainability, we're continuing to invest in creating a more sustainable supply chain for cocoa. We just unveiled a new Global Cocoa Technical Center in Indonesia, which will support sustainable cocoa farming practices, and drive positive change for farmers and communities. And finally, we are developing the sustainable futures investment program to amplify our impact in sustainability areas. Its role is to invest in innovative sustainability, and social impact solutions, mainly in our palm and cocoa growing communities. With these actions, even more so than before, we living our purpose to empower people to snack right. With that, I hand it over to Luca. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Dirk and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter performance was strong in terms of revenue grow, share gains, profitability and cash flow. As we exited Q2, we were already seeing signs of improvement in those business units that had been heavily affected by lock downs, and traditional trade grocers. And we were expecting a good quarter with a combination of sustained consumption trying to develop markets, but also returned to growth of our emerging market. We closed Q3 with overall growth of plus 4.4%. Our developed markets deliver a strong organic increase of plus 3.8%, while emerging markets return to more normal levels, delivering plus 5.3%. To provide more color, in developed market as far as North America goes, we continue to see elevated consumption versus pre-COVID levels, or be at lower rates than in Q1 and Q2. And for Europe too, we saw strong mass retail demand across all our key markets. In emerging markets, we saw good growth in 80% of the business unit revenue base, including in large businesses like India, China, Russia and Brazil, as operating restriction is enabling better mobility and access to traditional trade. Although the situation is better in the vast majority of our emerging markets, we expect some COVID restrictions and challenging economic circumstances to continue in parts of Latin America and Middle East Africa, and impacting disproportionately our gum and candy category. Growth this quarter included impacts of trade restocking, as demand spikes in North America and European retail, as well as traditional trade closures in emerging markets resulted in trade imbalances below normal levels as we exited Q2. This contributed approximately one point of growth. Turning to slide 10, Q3 revenue growth was driven by solid volume and pricing, mix was unfavorable due to world travel retail and gum revenues. As mentioned, growth includes approximately one point of pipeline refill. In terms of categories, biscuit continued to experience strong demand. We grow at nearly 8% driven by North America, EMEA and EU, with oil a key contributor and an important driver of our share gains in the category. Chocolate returned to grow at more than 5%. This was aided in part by large chocolate businesses such as India and Brazil, returning to robust growth, not overall. All key markets like the UK, Germany, Russia, Australia, France and Nordics did has a very good quarter. This result also includes nearly 2.5 points of headwinds related to world travel retail. Overall categories doing well and on top we are gaining share. Gum and candy declined double digit, primarily driven by gum, which improved from Q2 lows, but we still facing significant headwinds from social distancing and less out-of-home activity. And these particularly affected in some emerging markets like Mexico and Western Andean. Turning to slide 11, I wanted to spend a moment on e-commerce as this channel has clearly taken on more important. E-commerce revenue grew 78% on a reported basis in Q3, and represents 5% of our revenue base. In our top four market, we grew triple digits in the U.S., close to triple digits in the UK, and double digits in China and France. In some of those markets, our e-commerce share is greater than our offline share, while in others we have more headroom. We see multiple instances of significant e-commerce share gains this year, such as Yes [ph] Biscuit and UK Chocolate. Importantly, we believe e-commerce is driving incrementality as we look to meet and generate additional demand. This is also additive to our bottom line with profitability comparable to our offline business. Building on our existing trends, we are making substantial investments to take this business to the next level. This includes our increased investments in more digital working media, data driven engagement and improved online shopping site, ensuring we had the right packs and the right price, we did packs and bundles and testing new platforms to explore incremental opportunities in [Indiscernible] and direct-to-consumer. Turning to category and share highlight on page 12. Our effort to try meaningful and sustained share gains is succeeding, as strong as execution of our team's trusted global and local plans. And investments in more working media competitive ROIs are continuing to yield very good results. We have add or gain share 80% of our revenue based on the year to date basis. What we've shown this slide is rounded to the nearest 5%. But we were down 3% when compared to the last quarter as biscuits tick down slightly. Biscuits and chocolate were the big drivers once again as biscuits has gained share in 90% of our revenue base and chocolate has gained an 85%. Gum and Candy had gained 45%, notable share gains include the U.S., France, China, Russia biscuits, and UK, Russia and Australia chocolate. Many of the share gains such Yes in China biscuit and UK chocolate are quite significant in terms of their absolute size. Similar to our commentary last quarter, it is important to understand that the year to-date category growth of flat 3.7% doesn't reflect our major channels such as convenience and world travel retail. It also does not include the impact of our real business, which is performing quite well. Now let's review our profitability performance on slide 13. Overall, our profitability was strong in the third quarter. We increase gross profit due to volume leverage and productivity, as well as some promotional efficiencies. Operating income dollars increase more than 10% due to overhead reductions and simplification efforts, which helped offset COVID-related costs of approximately $60 million. COVID cost this year has been totaling so far about $200 million. Importantly, we continue to step up our work in media investment to further strengthen our brand. Stay top of mind of the consumers and position ourselves well going forward. Moving to regional performance on slide 14, North America grew 6.3% driven by elevated biscuit consumption and strong share gains. Ongoing investment in working media and strong DSP execution are helping us to sustain our growth they share gains. Gum was down double digit due to limited on the go consumption occasions. North America operating income increased by more than 18% due to volume leverage and cost control initiatives more than offsetting COVID-related costs and meaningful working media incremental investment. Europe revenue grew 3.4% in the quarter. We saw good category growth in chocolate, biscuits and meals. The breath of growth across key markets were quite impressive. With solid results in UK, France, Germany, Russia, Benelux and the Nordics. In terms of headwind, world travel retail continue to shine while below last year at circa 20% of 2019 revenue, and that as a headwind of more than 2.2 the EU. In terms of share performance, we drove notable share gains with UK, France, Germany and Russia. OI dollars return to grow as solid increases in volumes more than offset COVID-related costs and unfavorable mix. In addition, working media increase in the quarter. EMEA posted growth of 4.2% with growth across most markets as operating restrictions have become less onerous. China grew high single digit, following double digit growth in Q2 with significant share gains in biscuit. India returned to grow with a high single-digit increase for the quarter driven by chocolate and significant biscuit grow and the excellent execution of the team there. Australia, New Zealand and Japan posted low single digit growth. Southeast Asia grew mid single digits in Q3. But we did see some headwinds in certain countries such as Thailand and the Philippines, where towards the end of the quarter category slowed down due to more difficult economic conditions, which are expected to persist in the near term. Our Middle East and North Africa business decline low double digit as the economy there remains pressure. EMEA operating income dollars grew nearly 17% due to volume increases and cost mitigation effort despite meaningful increases in working media. Latin America grew 3.1% behind better results in Brazil, while Argentina grew due to inflation driven pricing. Ex Argentina, Latin America grew by approximately 1%. Mexico declined low double-digit due to a significant decline in gum and candy, which is more than 40% of that business, as out of home categories remained impacted by social distancing. The biscuit business in Mexico posted robust growth. In Brazil, we posted double digit growth in the quarter driven by growth in powder beverages, chocolate and biscuit. Underlying growth was mid single digits when taking into consideration the lapping of the supply chain related issues last year. Gum and candy remained significantly impacted by COVID, posting double digit declines. We feel good about the continued progress of our supply chain in store execution and market in this country. But we know that we have more work to do. Our Western Andean countries posted a decline as COVID continues to impact traditional trade channels. Gum and Candy as a category is down double digit, OI in Latin America grew 11% as pricing, cost containment measures and improve supply chain performance more than offset COVID-related costs. We also benefited from price hedges that are better than current spot rate. Our expectations is that part of Latin America will remain challenging in the near term. Given the restrictions in place and the economic environment in many markets. We remain focused on execution and targeted Investment to drive share gains, as well as cost controls. Now turning to earnings per share on slide 18. On a year to date basis EPS is up 6%, driven mostly by operating gain. Q3 EPS was strong versus previous years without breaking gains of $0.06 and taxes of setting them. I'll now move on to our free cash flow on slide 19. We deliver free cash flow of $1.7 billion through the first three quarters, an increase of almost $500 million versus previous year. Higher earnings more focused CapEx, lower restructuring and strong working capital management with a three day improvement in our cash conversion cycle have drive this result. In addition, deferred tax payments, some of which will reverse in Q4 also positively impacted this result. Moving to our outlook on slide 21. Disability still remains challenging in several markets. But we are providing an updated view of our expectations based on what we know today. We expect full year advantage revenue growth of 3.5% plus, implied Q4 would be broadly in line with Q3 when excluding the feeling of trade stock. We expect overall good EBIT growth in Q4, but below the three levels, particularly as we continue setting up working media, as we face some additional inflation in North America around transportation costs and that in Latin America, we expect the benefit of favorable currency hedges to subside. For the full year, adjusted EPS is expected to grow at 5% plus at constant ForEx. Free cash flow should be approximately $3 billion, ETR should be in the low to mid 20s. And adjusted interest expense is projected to be approximately $350 million. We are also planning to well take our share buyback program in the fourth quarter. Given the business is performing well, cash flow is strong and we have further strengthen our balance sheet. It is not expected to have a significant impact on EPS this year, given proximity to year end. For translation is now expected to negatively impact our reported revenue by approximately three percentage points, and EPS by $0.04 on the year based on current market trades. This is based on current conditions and does not factor in a significant degradation of the operating environment, that could be triggered by material gross and not COVID. This also incorporates the following expectations, a continuing level of elevated demand and in home consumption in certain developed markets, such as North America and Europe must repay. Headwinds in certain emerging markets predominantly in our Latin America region, the Middle East, North Africa, countries and parts of Southeast Asia and of our gum business. Continued weakness in world travel retail. With that, let's open it up for Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the one of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please go ahead. Andrew Lazar : Great. Thanks so much. Good afternoon. Dirk, as you pointed out in the prepared remarks, organic sales growth was withdrawn across all regions, perhaps you can maybe take us through your thoughts and how trends look currently in key regions as you enter 4Q? And then as a follow on, maybe you can extrapolate kind of 3Q results into 4Q and whatever you feel comfortable talking about now, regarding 2021 at this stage, because the company will obviously be lapping significant COVID costs, will have incremental brand investment, you'll be laughing, as well as incremental cost savings kicking in, right as you go into next year as well? Thanks so much. Dirk Van de Put : Okay. Thank you, Andrew. Maybe what I can do is, is do a little tour, maybe through categories and regions, because the two are quite linked. And then Luca can talk about Q4 and 2021. Andrew Lazar : Right? Dirk Van de Put : And so, if you look at the categories, categories are affected by the mobility of the consumers. So, I would say that 80% of our revenue is coming from advantaged categories that are performing very well. And in top in those categories, we have strong Mondelez brands and we are increasing our market share. So biscuits is the main driver at the moment. The demand remains very strong globally. We had high single digit revenue growth in Q3, and we had very strong share gains. Chocolates came back in Q3. It accelerated versus Q2, largely because of some of our emerging markets came back like for instance, India. And the 5% growth that we're seeing in Q3 is despite the world travel retail headwind, which squeezed off two points of the growth of chocolate, and yeah, world travel retail, as you can imagine, at this stage is still lower than 20% of what it was used to be. I think we do see that chocolate grow because we have a very advantaged portfolio which is skewed to at home consumption. In the emerging markets, we have a low unit price. We have good affordability in our chocolate and middle of the road with the right price points. But the one that remains very challenged is gum. We knew that in recessions or in moments that gum is affected, it recuperate slowly, but it's probably recuperating in a bit slower than we would have anticipated. And that has to see everything with the consumer mobility, the 75% of gum consumption is on the go. And even if we're not in lockdown anymore, or unfortunately about to go back to lockdown in Europe, the consumer is still not as mobile as before. And then meals and powder beverages are doing quite well. So if you keep that in mind, and then you go through the regions, and you know, more or less what the mixes of the regions gives you an idea of how we're doing. So North America 80% biscuit, demand of biscuits, as I said, remains very elevated. Our execution has been very strong, very strong share gains, consumers are snacking more at home, still well above the pre-COVID level, not as high as in March and April. But still quite increased consumption. And so, North America is solid. And seeing where we are with COVID and the fact that we probably will get more recommendations to stay at home, we expect this elevated consumption to continue for a while. In biscuit [ph], same in Europe in mass retail, but our business there is more also on the go with away from home. And world travel retail is consolidated in our European number. So apart from that Europe has very strong mass retail. And now that we go back in lockdown, we can expect that to remain like that. And we did see an improvement in the convenience channel in Europe. But as I said before, the world travel retail still remains very soft. And then in emerging markets, two thirds of our markets, which we had already mentioned in the Q2 call bounce back quite nicely. Talking about China, India, Brazil, and some of the European emerging markets like Russia, the Q2 was disrupted, but they're all coming back high single digit growth. At this stage, we do not expect a repeat of the disruption that we saw the beginning of the crisis. I think it's impossible in those countries to do the same sort of lockdowns that they did, because it led to severe economic effects. So we continue to see those markets recuperating with bit bumps, it's not going to be one nice road of birth, that depends a little bit on the local situation and what the government does. But overall, I would expect the emerging markets to gradually keep on improving. And then, there is one-third of our emerging markets that are in situations where the macro effects are more pronounced. On top, unfortunately, those markets are having a high mix of gum and candy in their sales. And so they are severely affected. And those are the ones that that are having more serious problems, talking about Mexico, Central America, talking also about the Middle East and parts of Africa, and also a few countries in Southeast Asia. So that gives you an idea where we are. I think that situation will continue in Q4, and even stretch out in the beginning of next year. I don't see a huge change taking place on the on the regional situations as we see them today. Maybe Luca, you can talk a little bit about Q4 and 2021. Luca Zaramella : Yes, sure. Hi, Andrew. So building on what they've just said, we had line of sight at this point to as we said, it fully of revenue outlook number that this 3.5 plus percent. And importantly, as Dirk just said, all the underlying trends that have been discussed so far up are probably unchanged into Q4 and certainly as we start November. And that is why we see a Q4 in terms of top line that is 3% or so bro [ph]. As far as EBIT goes Q4 should be another strong quarter, I want to reiterate. That is more in line with that last year growth rate. We will continue investing in working media. We'll see the benefit of that, Dirk alluded to higher ROI and the share gains up there to testify the merit for continuous investment. There will be some effect, but lower than in the past in terms of COVID costs, as well as and we are very pleased with the positive effect of the cost initiatives that we are putting in place. We have put in place as part of the emerge stronger. .: First of all, we expect to retain our share gains and to continue to invest not only in working media, but in marketing and sales. We've talked many times about the distribution opportunities we have around the world in emerging market as one example, despite COVID costs subsiding into next year, and we emerged stronger initiatives that in our mind will carry the benefits into 2021. We will reinvest the upside in the business to sustain the material share gains that we see potentially to weather and more recessionary environment. Biscuits and chocolate from what we see today will continue to do well. But as you say, we would be lapping some elevated growth in 2020, particularly in developed markets and biscuit. But on the flip side, I think there should be recovery of the most impacted called categories and countries. Talking about costs, commodities and ForEx inflation is in those stock [ph] aligned to what we have seen in the last few years. In some cases, for instance, in chocolate and cocoa, and in some countries, for instance, Brazil, there will be high inflation. But overall, we are in the neighborhood of what we have seen in the last few years. The sum of all of these, again, should lead to a 2021 that should be an algorithm. We will have to stay tuned and I'll give you more flavor and updates as we post the Q4 results. But needless to say that there are still someone knows, like Brexit or the potential tax change in the U.S., or in particular the lapse of COVID. And so I think it is important that we stay agile and we'll talk to you more about the situation if there is evolutional of what we know. Andrew Lazar : Great, thanks, everybody. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Andrew. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Dara Mohsenian : Hey, guys. Luca Zaramella : Hi, Dara. Dara Mohsenian : So what is impart for you. So, the market share results have been very impressive for you guys this year. And biscuits and chocolate obviously had some momentum pre COVID, but it's ramped up even more during COVID. So just wanted to get your thoughts on the sustainability of Mondelez market share gains as you look out to 2021, particularly as you have to cycle these difficult COVID comps and perhaps how the higher ANC spend might play into that? Dirk Van de Put : Yes. First of all, this quarter, the areas where we are gaining or holding share is at 85%. It's about three points lower than it was the previous quarter. That's minor. And so overall, I would say we've held on to our shares, geographically speaking and in revenue terms very well. What's more important, which we don't report here, but which we know is that the size of the market share gains is quite significant. And it seems some of the more important areas like in China gum or Germany chocolate or biscuits in the U.S., China, Brazil Germany and so on. If we analyze what happened is, in the beginning, I would say, at the beginning of the COVID crisis, it was our supply chain and our route-to-market that partially helped us. Because we saw an increase of our total distribution point. We saw very good customer service level seen the circumstances and, and so on. And we have DSD in some parts of the world. We also know that consumers in this crisis tend to go to trusted brands, they want to feel safe. So they go to the brands they know and trust, particularly the big heritage sort of taste of the nation brands around the world. And then we are accompanying that with increased media, and adapted messaging on our brands, as much as we can to the COVID situation. And that all seems to play very well for us. We've done a number of very successful adaptations of our brands. We can see the equity that we have in our brands increasing. And then the third factor I would say is, since there was more at home snacking, our range that we have in the different categories, our range of products is better suited. We are in more in the classical biscuits and crackers I would say, which is very well suited for home consumption and also in the tablet category of chocolates. And that's really helping us. So going forward with doing a number of actions to sustain those share gains. We increase our working media in the second half. But going into next year, we're continuing to do that same -- the same thing. And so yes, as Andrew was mentioning, we lap a number of things that that will be beneficial for us. We also have some cost pressures, obviously. But we are also increasing again, our AMC investment. Our algorithm allows us to do that. And I think it's critical in a situation where there might be a recession and the consumer might still be a little bit unsure. I think we need to keep on supporting our brands. So we think that will help. We are doing a lot of work on in-store visibility starting Christmas early, probably they'll start Easter early. We've got some very big team activations coming up for next year, some very exciting stuff. And so I feel that we probably have the best activity plan related to our brands that we've had in a number of years coming up for next year. And then we are working very hard on our promotional strategy. We're keeping an eye on value, and any value plus strategy that we need to do like no two-bites or family packs or whatever is needed for the at home consumption. And then the last thing we're doing is that we we've done a number of launches of innovation, innovation in certain countries like an expansion of the Milka spread the launch of the new biscuit brand in Germany and so on. And based on all these things, and the fact that we have momentum and when we seen great connection of our brands with the consumer, we are confident that on top of the elevated level of this year, we can increase our market share further next year. Dara Mohsenian : Great. Thanks. Okay. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Dara. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Ken Goldman with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Ken Goldman : Hi, good evening. You have taken down your exposure to joint ventures this year. I wanted to ask a little bit about this. Dirk, you've previously qualified these JVs, maybe a little bit more as investments than core strategic assets. Can you get us how do you see these investments today in respect to maybe some other opportunities you have out there? And does the sort of sale or partial sale of your equity, just say anything about your longer term strategy if anything? I guess I'm just trying to get what's the plan here going forward for some of these assets if you're willing to talk about it? Thank you. Luca Zaramella : Yeah. Thank you [Indiscernible] maybe I'll take that. I mean, we reiterate what we said many times. We remain optimistic about both assets. They have clearly a long term potential. To start with, they compete in a strong categories. They have solid fundamentals as categories and these companies are equipped to get more traction on key trends like on demand coffee as one example only. They are gaining share. They have a clear strategic direction. They are executing quite well. And there are strong management teams that can even enhance the advantage of the categories are in brand that both companies have. So there are all the ingredients in our mind for long term top and bottom line and cash flow potential. We are not able to really to talk specifically about JV and the results so far. But I think you saw a strong quarter for KBP continued momentum, top line between consensus, gaining penetration, strong share momentum, EPS, and really strong outcomes across all metrics, and they continue to be leveraged and create cash flow. So we believe that the value is higher than what the current stock price would say for both companies. And not in consistent with other companies as well in the broad CPG world. We made a series of moves, quite frankly, were more tactical than anything. And if you look at our balance sheet, we have showed the top quite well since the beginning of the year. So on KDP we are comfortable around current levels of ownership. And if we make further trades, there will be at the right value for us and we will try to coordinate with other major shareholders. And on JV, clearly, we are a major shareholders. We own 22.9% of the company. We did welcome the IPO that is giving us an avenue for optionality. And having said that, though, we are committed for the long term success of the company, you might expect some trades from us in the coming quarters that should improve the current limited flow. But we will remain disciplined both in JV and KDP. And under current circumstances, we want to retain the presence in both stocks. So what you have seen recently was more tactical than anything. We took advantage of certain stock price levels. I will remain committed to these companies and we'll did believe in the potential. But as you said over time, we want to replace those with snaking assets. Ken Goldman : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Bryan Spillane : Hey, good afternoon, everyone. So maybe just a follow up on Luca, the comment you made in response to Andrews question related to algorithm next year. And more interested in at this point in cash flow. So I guess two questions around that. One, would you expect that free cash flow would also be or free cash flow of conversion would also be sort of on algorithm. And then maybe connected to that, part of the algorithm has been returning cash to shareholders via share repurchases and dividend increases annually. So, would we expect that that would be part of the equation again in 2021? Luca Zaramella : So, the straight answer to the last part of the question is absolutely, yes, we remain committed to dividends to what we said several times about dividend growing in excess of EPS. I think the last dividend increase reflects that. Share buybacks should continue absent in a acquisitions or things that at this point might happen or not. And so I will say yes, there should be share buybacks. And final your free cash flow, free cash flow, there is no reason to expect a slow down into next year. Having said that, I think, you know, we went public with JV that reset the base for tax purposes in Europe. And there is a tax component that is going to be track [ph] into free cash flow next year. But I feel like at this point might not be going up from this year, but considering some of the tax one time as I just thought, I think you can think about a three plus billion dollar cash flow unit for next year. That's the plan at this point. Bryan Spillane : Okay, terrific. Thanks, Luca. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Bryan. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please go ahead. Chris Growe : Hi, good evening. Thank you. I just had two questions if I could. The first one would just be in relation to the SKU rationalization program. Just want to get a sense of does that start here in the quarter? Does that ramp up in the fourth quarter in the next year? And I guess, I'm also curious like where you see the benefits of that coming through? So as you come behind that with more innovation, is it just better volume growth? Is there mix improvement, that sort of thing? And then just a quick question, if I could on inventory levels, you had some benefit this quarter from shipping inventory. Does that are you back to where you want retail inventories to be or your own inventories? Are there more building to go as we move in the fourth quarter of next year? Thank you. Dirk Van de Put : Okay. Maybe I'll do the SKUs and Luca can do the inventory. So the SKUs, the timeline on that is gradual, largely driven in the negotiations with the trade. And around the world, there are certain moments you can make these changes. And for instance, in Europe, that moment is the beginning of next year. So we are preparing for it now. But the implementation will only be beginning of next year. So roughly I would say, if you look at it around the world, we should be 75% done by year end. And then the rest would be done in the beginning of 2021. You have to think about this as part of a broader simplification program that is meant to drive both the top line and the bottom line and cash flow. It's a simplification of SKUs, the number of innovation initiatives, and also looking at our brand portfolio. So we do not expect the negative top line impacted. They represent -- 25% represent 2% 3% of our revenue, but we think we will easily replace that with higher velocity on the remaining SKUs will get more shelf space. And then the benefits, as I already mentioned, more sales, we expect our inventories to go down because it's those SKUs that take a lot of the inventory. In manufacturing, it is less complexity, less downtime, fewer changeover. So it gives us a benefit on our costs. And then on the customer side, we give them better customer service. It's going to be easier for them to manage their shelf, and so their costs go down still. So it's just a support to deliver our long term algorithm. This is not meant to be transformative from a margin perspective. But it does help us to deliver on the top and the bottom line and the cash flow of our algorithm. Luca? Luca Zaramella : Yes. On inventory levels, there are obviously puts and takes. I would say, we got to a more normalized level at the end of Q3. Overall, I think we are in a decent situation. As I said there might be places where we need to do a little bit more other way we are fine. I wouldn't expect if we pick up due to inventory replenishment in the courses to come. And obviously we want to end the year with the right level of inventory as we have always done. Chris Growe : Thank you for those answers. I appreciate it. Luca Zaramella : Thank you. Operator : And your next question is from a lot of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Moskow : Thank you. Just wanted to make sure I understood the implied sales guide for 4Q. It seems like it's below 3%. Year to date year at 3.9%. So just wanted to understand why it might be lower than year to date. And then also can you think more specifics about cost reduction plans, the efficiency plans? It looks like a quarter they work in LatAm and they work in AMEA. And is that where most of these cost reduction plans are going to take place? And if so, does that make it more difficult to capitalize on the growth as they recover? Thanks. Luca Zaramella : We said it is 3.4% plus on the full year. So the implied growth rate as I said, it is an about 3% for Q4. I wouldn't read too much into different number than 3% in Q4. I also clearly said that there is one point of growth in the 4.4% that you see in Q3. So again, we are not mind so as you think about Q4. Importantly at this point with the right level of trade inventory. And as we look into next year, again, we want to write all the initiatives that will allow us to read here that on our way. I think that's a simple way to think about it. In terms of cost initiatives, I would say they are pretty much across the board. The most stronger initiatives, the initiatives we have taken in terms of designing our cost packages in terms of pushing net revenue growth, in terms of working to reduce non-working media and increasing working media. Those are effects that you see consistently throughout the regions. Yes, there might be regions like the U.S. where or North America where are we read a little bit more in terms of revenue growth management, but overall, again, they are fairly consistent across the board. Robert Moskow : Okay. Thank you. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Robert. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Alexia Howard : Hi, there. Good evening. Can you hear me? Luca Zaramella : Yes. Hi. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, Alexia. Alexia Howard : Two quick questions. Firstly, on immerging e-commerce. You talked about now [Indiscernible] presumably [Indiscernible]. And then my follow up around [Indiscernible] full of a ton coming in for the Yes [ph]. You're talking about a new center I believe. Are you thinking about changing [Indiscernible] sourcing code? Or is about how that strategy? Thank you. Dirk Van de Put : Thanks, Alexia. It was very broken up. So I had difficulties understanding what you're exactly as there was an echo somewhere on the line and made it difficult. I think you were asking -- I heard it was about e-commerce, but I don't know what the details were. Somebody did look at the look or maybe you try again. Luca Zaramella : Yes. I didn't understand the second part of the question at all. I mean, I know the first part was about e-commerce. The second part, I have no clue. Alexia Howard : Can I try? Can you hear me? Dirk Van de Put : Yes. There still.. Alexia Howard : Let's try once again. Is it clearer now? Dirk Van de Put : Yes. Alexia Howard : Yes. Perfect. All right. So on e-commerce, you mentioned that you are under represented in some areas and overrepresented in e-commerce, different regions, obviously, areas where you're underrepresented relative to your motor sales that might be the area where you've got more headroom. Could you just give us an idea of which regions those are where you think there are real opportunities? And then the second question was on cocoa sourcing. I'm just curious about whether you might be changing your regional approach to cocoa sourcing given your -- you put a new center of excellence in Indonesia. Meanwhile, there's coke $400 a ton and cocoa, tax is going in, in some parts of Africa. Are you thinking about changing your regional approach to where you're getting the cocoa from globally? Hopefully, you could hear that better? Dirk Van de Put : Yes, yes. Yes. Now it worked. It was not you it was the technical side of things, Alexia. Alexia Howard : Understood. Dirk Van de Put : On ecommerce. Yes. First of all, we're seeing a very good growth in e-commerce, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks. Roughly, you could say that our e-commerce headspace is largely in China and in the U.S. The rest, the two other big countries we have are the UK and France. But I would say the biggest gap we have in China, which we are catching up, we're working very hard on that. Overall, we've seen market share gains, largely in most of the areas around the world with the exception of France at the moment. And we've also started to enter into smaller countries. And that is going to give us some extra gain also. Overall though, if you take globally our shares on and offline are similar. So we have some headroom here and there, but then we are over represented somewhere else. So that's a little bit the situation on e-commerce. Going forward, it's about expanding our assortment to meet the channel need. Its about recreating impulse experience. It's about developing our data as it relates to the consumers and getting better connections with them, it's about putting more investment in there. And then, experimenting with to other areas that are that are developing for us in e-commerce, which is e-business-to-business and direct to consumer. So also important to mention is that our margins are similar online and offline. So that's the situation on e-commerce. If I go to cocoa, we are not --we are experimenting with cocoa in other regions. But at this stage, we are going to continue in large part to continue to source from Ghana and Ivory Coast. We source in Latin America. We source in India. We source in Indonesia. But we are one of the biggest cocoa buyers in the world. And so it, those regions do not offer us enough quantity to shift and shifting, developing real cocoa sourcing takes years. So we're working on that, but it's not going to happen next year, not with the amount of cocoa that we need to buy. On the other hand, we have already started to reflect the extra LID or the living income differential into our pricing. And so, we are fully set to absorb that next year. And we feel good about supporting what the government in those two countries are trying to do. We think it fits in our ESG approach. And at the same time, we keep -- we want to keep on going with our own program Cocoa Life, which is complimentary to that. We think it's the right thing to do, because we want a real sustainable future for cocoa. And farmer income is really critical. And we were making sure through Cocoa Life we can actually see that and monitor what's going on. So we are planning to have 100% of our cocoa volume by 2025 being sourced through our Cocoa Life program. So I would say that is the answer on cocoa. Alexia Howard : Perfect. Thank you very much for the color. I'll pass it on. Thank you. Dirk Van de Put : No problem. Luca Zaramella : Thank you. Operator : And your final question is from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Palmer : Thanks. Good evening, just a follow up on emerging markets and a question on the marketing or grocery investments. On EMs, you had nice improvement in Russia, Brazil and some other markets. And you mentioned in the previous question that you expect emerging markets to continue to improve. I think you also said in your prepared remarks that there was some late quarters slowing into Asia outside of China. So maybe just some clarification about where you feel like the momentum is in continuing to improve across emerging markets would be helpful. And then it just in terms of your growth reinvestments you guys don't have -- sort of just a windfall this year, such that you're spending a ton of money in advertising. So I expect this to be somewhat of a measured plan about what you're doing. And you said, advertising or working media, as you said it will be going up particularly in digital. So could you talk about that gross spending, where you're spending it? What's -- where you're getting this high ROI, and do you think that's going to continue into 2021? Thanks. Dirk Van de Put : Okay. I'll take the first part and you will do the second part, Luca. Luca Zaramella : Yes. Dirk Van de Put : So on emerging markets, I would say the temporary headwinds in our mind do not hamper the long term prospects. We feel that we're executing well. We have an advantage network. We have deep distribution. We have good from momentum pre crisis. We're coming out of the crisis in most of the emerging markets very fast. I'm thinking about India, Brazil, we have share r gains that we see. And obviously, we can only focus on what we control which is execution, cost management, selective investment. We remain confident about tutors as I mentioned, and those are the markets where we're seeing good momentum, China, India, European, sorry, emerging markets, Brazil little bit of the parts of Africa. We feel that they're already back in positive territory. We're confident that they will keep on growing. They were performing very well for us before the crisis, if anything, I think we've improved our position during the crisis. And we have very strong teams on the ground. Where we are cautious and where we need to work hard, because we are hampered by the local situation that's more in Latin America, thinking Mexico, thinking walk down for us, which is the Central America and the Caribbean, and Colombia, and some of the Middle Eastern and the Southeast Asia countries. That's where gum and candy is big for us. And the recuperation of gum and candy is going to be critical for us. So we're doing a lot of work on how to promote gum consumption in the time of COVID, where people are more spending more time at home when they're wearing masks, and so on, which is, which is contraindicated for gum consumption. And we are trying to make sure that for next year we see good momentum in that category. So that's the part where I would say that we are a bit more careful. Luca? Luca Zaramella : Yes. So now may you see David, the way you have to see it these putting in Q2, given the circumstances we pulled back. And so we double down in the second part of the year. And as we said, many times, the share gains that we're seeing, they are truly broad based. They are across multiple brands, multiple countries with the exception, I would say of gum, we are extremely pleased with the share gains we have seen in this case in chocolate. And so we want to retain those and that we will continue to invest into 2021. So between the fact that COVID cost will subside between the fact that in Q2, we will be lapping lower energy spending. I think you will see an algorithm that in terms of EBIT and EPS expansion should be in line with expectations for next year. Don't expect the same material impact that we are heading in the second part of the year in terms of working media into next year. As A, we will be lapping a lower Q2. And B, we will have other labors into the P&L, including COVID costs that will subside, to be able to fund these incremental investments. By realities, the more we can retain those share gains, the better even in a context where maybe categories will be slightly impacted by a potential recession. David Palmer : Very, very helpful. Thank you. Luca Zaramella : You're very welcome, David. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you. I think with that's no further questions. Operator : Okay. And there are no further questions. At this time, I would like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks. Dirk Van de Put : Okay. Thank you, Angela. Well, thank you for connecting. As you can see, we had a good, solid third quarter. We feel good about the where the fourth quarter is heading and how we will close the year. We've given you a first flavor of what 2021 looks like, which we also feel pretty good about. And obviously in the next call, we will give you the guidance for the year. If that is possible, because you never know what happens in these COVID situations. Thank you for your interest. And thank you for your questions. And if there's anything else, feel free to connect Andrei or Chef, we can give you more information. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Mondelez International Fourth Quarter 2020 Year-End Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour including remarks by Mondelez management and the question-and-answer session.  I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondelez. Please go ahead, sir. Shep Dunlap : Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO; and Luca Zaramella, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides which are available on our website. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you, Shep, and thank you everyone for joining the call today. I am pleased to share our full year and Q4 results with you. 2020 was a successful year for Mondelez International marked by strong performance even in a challenging external environment. In response to unprecedented conditions caused by COVID-19, we took decisive and swift actions to position the company for continued success in 2021 and beyond and we delivered on all of our financial commitments for the year. I am proud of our achievements and particularly grateful for the efforts of our teams, including those on our front lines who helped us to achieve these milestones. First of all, we sustained the top line momentum we have achieved since launching our strategy in 2018, delivering another year of 3% plus organic net revenue growth. This led to record market share gains as consumers chose our products and made us clear winners in our largest categories of biscuits and chocolate. Despite COVID-19, we continued executing against our strategic growth agenda and increased investment across our business, in particular, in working media and capabilities like e-commerce. We added two very exciting bolt-on acquisitions, Give & Go and Hu, which give us more exposure to fast growing snacking adjacencies. Our continued investments were supported by an effective cost mitigation program that offset many of the COVID-19-related costs and helped simplify our business. In spite of the increased investment and costs, we were able to grow operating income faster than revenue and faster than 2019 through volume leverage and cost discipline. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Dirk, and good afternoon everyone. Our 2020 performance was strong in terms of revenue growth, share gains, profitability and free cash flow. We delivered volume-led revenue growth for the year and the quarter of plus 3.7% and plus 3.2%, respectively. Developed markets grew 4.5% for the year and 2.8% for the quarter, underpinned by strong execution and share gains. Emerging markets increased 2.3% for the year which includes a mid-single digit decline experienced during the height of COVID disruptions. For the quarter, we posted growth of 4.1%. Some additional color on Q4. In developed markets, we continued to see elevated consumption for our biscuits category in North America, albeit growth has slowed down versus first half. In Europe, we delivered strong Q4 in both chocolate and biscuits, consistent with Q3. In emerging markets, we delivered good growth across the majority of our revenue base, including double-digit growth in Eastern Europe and mid-single digit growth in AMEA emerging markets. A small group of markets continue to face economic challenges and headwinds related to higher Gum & Candy exposure. This is predominantly in Latin America, which grew just over 1% in Q4. Overall, we continue to feel good about emerging markets and their future prospects, and in general, they have recovered quite well after the lockdown impacts in Q2. Now on Slide 11 and portfolio performance. This is an important page as it shows how well the vast majority of our business is performing during the pandemic. The strength of biscuits and chocolate, meals and powdered beverages shows that we have an advantaged portfolio with a good geographical footprint and that our execution resulting in meaningful share gains has amplified growth above category rates. Biscuits grew nearly 9% for the year and 7% for the quarter. North America was a big growth driver due to elevated demand and brand investments. Europe and EMEA also delivered strong Q4 results. Oreo was a clear standout worldwide growing double-digits and mainly Local Jewels too posted high growth this year and increased penetration. Chocolate grew more than 3% for the year and 5% for the quarter. This includes nearly 2 points of headwinds from world travel retail in the full year and the negative impact of lockdowns in Q2. But overall, this is a great category to be in, and on top, our brands continue to perform very well both in DMs and EMs and continued to gain share. Operator :  Your first question is from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please go ahead. Andrew Lazar : Hi, Andrew. Two part question, if I could. First maybe Dirk if you could describe maybe some of the key puts and takes that you see regarding the 3% plus organic sales growth guidance for '21. I'm really just trying to get a sense for the level of visibility and maybe if there is some flex there, given how dynamic the environment remains? And then secondly with respect to Mondelez lapping some of the significant COVID costs of last year and benefiting from the initiatives and the accelerated initiatives that you've talked about. I guess would you see room for potential upside to the high-single digit constant FX EPS growth guidance, and if not just curious what the offsets might be? Thank you. Dirk Van de Put : Okay, all right. Thanks, Andrew. So the 3% plus for next year. The first thing that we want to keep in mind is that it's very difficult to predict what's going to happen. While I think we delivered quite nicely on our financial commitments in 2020. Under the surface, there was a lot of puts and takes and it looks like that environment at least for the first half will continue. So it's very early in the year, we will see what happens with the vaccines and the mobility of the consumer and the at-home consumption in emerging markets. So we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. We do feel confident enough to say that this will be a third consecutive year of delivering on-algorithm, and as you might remember, that is a significantly step up from where it was before 2018. If I break it down, as Andrew asked, the tailwinds that we see is, first of all, the biscuits and chocolate categories are performing very well, and on top of that, we have broad-based significant share gains. So despite lapping that in 2020, we believe the categories will continue to perform well and that we will still continue to gain market share. The second tailwind, I would mention is that, we have very solid momentum going into '21. Our H2 growth rate was above 3% and so we see that continuing. In H2, we also invested quite heavily, that would be the third tailwind for me, with a big step up in working media, we are going to continue to do that in 2021, so that should also give us a push. And then, we can't neglect that we will be lapping a weak year in Gum & Candy, in world travel retail and some of the smaller emerging markets, so we believe that that will help us also. As it relates to headwinds that we will see, I would separate them in geographies, channels and categories. To start with the categories, for us, it's about the Gum category and how fast that category will come back, it's largely based on mobility of the consumers, we haven't seen much movement in the second half of the year, so we are not assuming that there will be a big movement in the first half of next year or this year, sorry. So we want to plan prudently there. As it relates to channels, it's about world travel retail and on-the-go consumption. And for the time being, we've also assumed that in the first half of the year that is not going to come back at a very high rate. And in geographies, we feel that the BRIC markets and other larger emerging markets are performing well and we see them quite nicely coming back in Q4, but there are some smaller markets like Mexico, LATAM, North Africa, where we will likely be challenged for a while longer largely because they have a big gum business. So I would say at this stage, we feel comfortable with 3% plus. We will see how the situation evolves, but we want to be, yeah, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves and see how the first quarter comes along. Andrew Lazar : Thanks very much. Shep Dunlap : The second question. I might hand over to - thank you, Andrew. The second question, I'm going to hand over to Luca about the EPS and what we see there. Luca Zaramella : Yes. Thank you, Dirk. So maybe let me step back for a second and give you the key puts and takes on the profitability line. We count in 2021 on continued volume growth and the leverage effect that is associated with that. You remember, that in our algorithm, volume is, together with pricing, a critical component. We want to continue to be disciplined in our pricing approach and we will leverage all elements of, what we call, revenue growth management to offset what these relatively higher cost inflation than what we saw in 2020. I said quite a few times that inflation in 2021 will not be materially different than previous years, but it is moderately higher than what we saw before. And there are certain peaks around currencies, commodities, I mentioned a few times, cocoa, grains are expensive cost types and certain transportation costs and packaging. So we are good for most part of the exposure that is well covered. So I don't expect this situation to spiral out of control, but reality is, as Dirk said, there'll be top more cost pressure. On the other cost lines, we will continue to deliver productivities in line with what we have seen in the last couple of years. COVID costs will be more moderate in 2021, we called out that there will be roughly one-third of what we incurred in 2020. And most of the emerged stronger benefits will carry through 2021. The degree of freedom, so to speak, Andrew is against investment. And whether we deliver better profit, we will take that upside and we expect to invest even on top of what we had at the current level into 2021 as we really want to sustain share gains and make strides into the strategic agenda that we have. On tax and interest. I think we have been fair in terms of assumptions and hopefully that were clear. So I think high-single digit EPS is what we are going to get. I think importantly on cash flow just to round up the answer, we have to pay some taxes related to coffee transactions and what we call a $3 plus billion is actually an underlying free cash flow that is roundabout $3.5 billion. So good numbers also there that clearly rely on profitability and continued working capital management. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Ken Goldman : Thanks, everybody. I wanted to ask about the guidance about or regarding currency being a $0.10 tailwind to the bottom line this year. I just wanted to make sure I understood is that $0.10 what you're expecting to flow probably through to the bottom line, is that the maximum possible and you may reinvest some of that. I just wanted to get a better sense of how we should think about modeling that, just given your history of sort of reinvesting those additional earnings, so to speak? Luca Zaramella : Yes, I'll start and it is translation and it is based on current spot rates. So whether they stay here or they improve or they worsen, we are not going to change our stance on the investment posture. At this point in time, the $0.10 is pure upside to EPS. Ken Goldman : I'll follow up offline on that one. And then my second question is, I was a little surprised to see the guidance for $2 billion in share repo. I know that's flexible, but you do have, I think, $3.5 billion on the balance sheet, you're expecting to generate another $3 billion. Why shouldn't we look for a little bit more aggressive buyback in 2021 and what that $2 billion implies? Luca Zaramella : Because we keep guidance consistent in terms of what we say in terms of EPS and share buybacks, you are right. We're saying that provides us great flexibility, should cash flow be better, should we decide to do something more with our coffee and might not have some acquisitions coming along, we will be flexible and we fine tune the number. I think the way you have to look at it is should the circumstances stay the same as today at least we will do $2 billion. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Steve Powers : So I mean - this question maybe for you, Luca, I don't know, but I guess I was looking for a little bit more of a bridge in the year-over-year moving gross margins in the quarter? And then as a follow-on what you're assuming about those moving parts into '21 because in the end, what I'm really trying to understand is, I know you don't manage the gross margin, but it seems with the inflation that is building even as you catch up on pricing versus inflation dynamics in Latin America, as you mentioned, it seems like the gross margin being up in '21 could be ambitious. So I'd love some color around that. And if you don't think you can improve gross margins, you are not planning on it, then I guess that also curious as to what the sources of G&A efficiency might be in the coming year that will enable the EPS flow through as well as the higher working media investments that you called out? Luca Zaramella : Yes. So clearly in the cost line, there was an impact due to COVID extra costs. And I think when I look at the year and I strip that out, what I can tell you is that overall gross profit and gross margins, they were pretty much in line with expectations. There is a big catch and the catch is the fact that particularly Gum & Candy suffered a decline that was around about 20%, that category is a category that is quite profitable and stripping out 20% of the volume in 2020 resulted in a sub-scale type of category with under absorption on a few P&L lines. In that regard, what I would say is, if I take out COVID and Gum & Candy, I think the level of profitability is sound. We have a couple of things that we need to bear in mind, we were afraid that we would have a subdued Christmas season which didn't happen. We had record high shares in Christmas but we spent a little bit more in making sure that the stock was rotating, that's one impact. And the second thing is, we haven't fully implemented pricing actions in quite a few places around the world as we run out of coverage particularly in Latin America, the exchange rate impact was quite material and we priced ahead of running out of coverage and we will price afterwards in an attempt to know what consumer prices are. So in structural terms, I would say that there is nothing that is concerning me at this point about gross profit. I think you will see a P&L that makes sense in 2021. The level at which we will see gross profit in 2021 will obviously depend on the level of recovery of Gum & Candy, which happens to be something that we don't fully know of and we don't fully control. But in terms of structure, I think gross profit is sound, we have announced pricing actions around the world. We have visibility to the commodity pipeline for the vast majority of it and ForEx recover. We delivered excluding COVID costs, sound productivities in 2020. We count on the same level in 2021. And by the way, when I look at the overhead line, excluding A&C, we did a terrific job in 2020 reducing overhead by almost 50 basis points and we want to continue cost pressure and keeping the costs in control. So from my side at this point, I would say, I feel overall good for 2021 GP, there might be a little bit of timing effect in Q1. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Jason English : Thank you for sliding me in and congratulation for successfully navigating a pretty crazy year behind us. Let's hope this year is a little less crazy. It's - thank you so much for the incremental color or all the details you've given about the underpinning assumptions here at your guidance. Based on the conversations I have with investor is I'm guessing the one area of debate that sort most hotly debated is your comment on sustained share gains next year. There is a lot of people who look at your market share performance this year and believe there is a degree of transitory benefit from the reality that you have a DSD organization versus a North America DSD against some others with warehouse allowing superior service levels, I mean the scale of your supply chain also once again allowing superior service levels and that those benefits naturally unwind and you're going to see share pressure in North America or Europe or some of these DMs where you gained so much. What do you think is - where do you think that argument is fault so or the way we get asked what gives you confidence in your ability to sustain those share gains next year? Dirk Van de Put : Yes. I would say, there is a number of arguments. The first one is, if you look at the share gains that we incurred in the second quarter of '20. And then you look at what happened in Q3 and Q4, we - our share gains didn't fade, they remained quite strong, and so we could already have expected that sort of effect that you are describing, Jason, in Q4 of this year. The largest categories that we are in - continuing to shine and our performance in there is pretty good. It's not just our gains with our DSD system in the U.S., but we have 80% of our revenue base around the world where we are gaining and holding share plus the share gain itself is quite substantial. The share gain in '20 was much higher than in 2019 where we also had a share gain. So if I look going forward, what are we going to do to make sure that effect doesn't happen? First of all, we have investments and then are substantially going to increase into '21, our financial equation can afford it, you've talked a little bit about that we constantly reinvest whatever we would over-deliver in our bottom line, and for the time being, we are planning to continue to do that in order to push our growth up. Second, we are having some very good channels effect particularly e-commerce. We are also preparing to move very fast away from home, which will give us a boost, world travel retail and also convenience stores. So that will also give us an extra boost and we will make sure that we move faster than anybody else there. Our customer service is good and it's very good. We had our supply chain perform really well, but there is still room for improvement because it was good in the times of COVID, it was not as good compared to normal time. So we think we will still have an upside from our customer service. And then we are doing a lot of work on RGM in order to protect our key price points and retain consumers. We've gained a lot of new consumers into our brands. We were quite curious to see what was going to happen again in Q3 and Q4. We were able to retain them and we're counting to be able to do that again into next year. And then we have a very strong program probably the strongest that I've seen since I'm here in innovation and also in activation. So because of all those reasons, I feel pretty good about our opportunity to come - to continue our momentum in market share going forward. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Dara Mohsenian : So the clarity on market share was helpful. I was just wondering could you parse down the 2021 organic sales growth you are expecting. How much market share gains are you expecting after the strong gains we saw in 2020? Is it a similar magnitude, it sounds like maybe perhaps it's continuing but smaller? And then second just on category growth, are you expecting an acceleration in category growth overall in 2021 relative to 2020. Obviously, there were some areas like gum or chocolate and travel retail that were down, significantly there are other areas like biscuits that improved sequentially in 2020. So just sort of curious for overall category growth? How are you thinking about that growth in 2021 relative to 2020 and if you see any acceleration there overall? Dirk Van de Put : Yes. Well, I would say, as it relates to organic sales growth and share gains, we are planning to continue share gains, but not to the magnitude that we've seen in 2020. We don't communicate on the magnitude, we just give the countries where we have gained or increase our market share, but we expect that the share gain will be of a lesser magnitude, I can tell you that and I think it's a reasonable assumption. As it relates to the category growth rates, in the measured channels, it was 3.1% for 2020 which was a slight decline versus 2019 where we saw a 3.6%. And then of course you have the unmeasured channels, which were declining like away from home and world travel retail. So likely if you would add those channels to it, you were probably looking at the total growth very, very minor growth and most of our outperformance of the category was driven by our market share gains in 2020. I think in '21, what we are expecting at least is some reversion to the norm with the customers going back into the unmeasured channels from the measured channels, and so as the restriction ease, so that the - that will mean that the measured channel growth will slow next year, but that the combination of the two will remain about the same, maybe slightly less. And so we don't have to count on as much share gains to get to the growth that we are talking about. I hope that's helpful. Dara Mohsenian : And then just one other question on the A&C line, clearly you guys ramped up in the second half of the year after a pullback in the first half. Did - I'm wondering did you see the same efforts in terms of increased ad spend generally from competitors? How are you feeling about your share of voice in the marketplace on the ad spend front in the back half of the year and leaving 2020? Thanks. Dirk Van de Put : I don't know, if Luca wants to say something about our investments, but as it relates to competition, I can quickly comment on that. Yes, they are also increasing their spend, so I would say that our share of voice has remained about the same. And everybody has done a little bit the same, I would say, didn't spend that much in Q2 and came back in H2. So I don't see any major differences there, but I cannot predict what's going to happen in the beginning of the year, I just know what we are about to do. So maybe Luca you want to talk a little bit about our overall investments. Luca Zaramella : Yes. So in terms of investments, Dirk, you are right, we stepped it up particularly in the second half, but I think you've seen the material we called out that working media is growing 17%. We plan to keep the same level of increases in 2021. So we are building on a continuous investment in working media which importantly comes together with improved ROI, which means high quality media we are putting behind our brands. We are investing more in digital, which in general terms commands a little bit more ROI than other regular channels. And third, again the essence of diverting nonworking media into working media improves the overall spending ROI. So there is a compounded effect between increasing investment and having a better return on what we spend. And again, I think we said it well, when we look at market and share in Q4 we didn't slow down overall for the company, and what that means, is that, yes, we had clear advantages in terms of supply chain at the beginning of the crisis, but as the situation normalized for us and for other competitors, people continued to favor our franchises to others. And I think one of the drivers is clearly the fact that we have invested more, that we have more meaningful innovation and that we are activating effectively at point of sales. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Bryan Spillane : Couple of quick ones from me. First, Luca, I don't know if I missed it or not, but did you give guidance for '21 on capital spending? Luca Zaramella : No, I didn't, but I think it is 3.5%. That's the number you have to have in mind. Bryan Spillane : And then again second one just with regard to kind of modeling out revenues for 2021, in 2020 emerging or developed markets grew faster than developing and emerging markets. I mean in particular you grew over 8% in North America. So we're kind of thinking about contribution and that balance in '21, would we expect that to flip, are you expecting emerging - developing and emerging to grow faster than developed? And then second, North America, given how strong that comp is, is that something that actually grow off of in '21? Luca Zaramella : We usually don't provide segment guidance and I would like to stay away from that, but I think the - what you are saying makes sense. Now I think you have to bear in mind that within developed market, Europe wasn't stellar in Q2, that Europe has world travel retail in it that got a material impact. So I expect Europe to grow. I think in the case of North America, obviously, we are lapping a 13%, 11% I believe respectively in Q1 and Q2 so that would be the toughest comparison. But then in the second part of the year, numbers are easier and hopefully as gum comes back, we will have a positive impact. We are putting together and we have put together actually quite good plans for the three acquisition platforms that we acquired in the last few years. And so I think there is more to come from North America in developed markets, but I wouldn't draw the conclusion that it is all bundled together because North America grew double-digit in the first half. In emerging markets, again, I'm really happy about what I'm seeing. China grew nicely in Q4, almost double-digit, it was just shy of double-digit. India grew more than 10% so did Russia. Brazil grew high-single digits so I'm positive about the evolution of developing markets overall. Clearly, there are some of them particularly in Latin America that are impacted by Gum & Candy. But again as we start lapping Q2 numbers, that should be better. I think as you step back and you look at 3.1% category growth in 2020, we have always said categories will grow 3% or so. I think you should expect the same type of category growth with all the puts and takes, clearly, biscuit being a little bit lower but Gum & Candy being much more positive, you should expect category growth in the neighborhood of 3% and on top of that towards shares. Operator : Your next question is from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. John Baumgartner : Luca, two part for me. First off, reinvestment has been a big theme behind the top line improvement over the past two years and again here in 2021. And I'm wondering if you could speak to what's driving the higher return on spending for media investment. How much do you attribute to just straight cost improvements from agency consolidations and then how much from other aspects, whether it's better quality programming from the local first or even better in-store activation that better leverages that media spend? Luca Zaramella : Yes, maybe I'll let Dirk take this one. I mean I have a point of view, but I think Dirk is the expert here. So yeah, Dirk. Dirk Van de Put : Yes. Well, first of all, we have been shifting around in our A&C budget. What we've done is we have increased our working media and the balance was, to my opinion, a little bit off. So the net effect in media has been significant, as Luca was commenting in last year, and we have continuing that effect in '21. On top of that, we are increasing our overall budget and so we have increased the percentage of A&C of net revenue in '20 and we're going to do the same in '21. The third driver of our increased ROI is a bigger switch to digital. So we are now well above - 50% of our investment is in digital and we know that we can drive a much better effect and much better targeting of our consumers. And then the last effect, I would say, for our increase in ROI is the fact that we've done a lot of work on our brands, worked on purpose, we worked on communication, we have done a number of things that really have had a big effect, call it, Oreo, Cadbury, Milk, really some big strides, for instance, to mention the Lady Gaga Oreo that's going to hit stores today. I think that's generating a lot of buzz and we've done many of these things. There is some effect, but it's minor, well minor is maybe a big word, it is not the biggest driver on agency rationalization, if I can say it, and some margin negotiation. So there is some of that in there, but that is not - certainly not the biggest driver of what we've done. John Baumgartner : Thanks Dirk. I'll look for the Lady Gaga. I appreciate that. And then secondly, just a follow-up there. Going back to FX, we've seen FX headwinds for a number of years now and I'm curious, to the extent that those may now reverse in your favor for translation yes, but also maybe even driving some trickle down benefits operationally where maybe you'll leave some of them to take pricing in foreign markets. To what extent do you think the market doesn't fully appreciate the potential benefits from that on EPS or even volume growth in your stock valuation? Luca Zaramella : Yeah. Thank you, John, for the question. Clearly, we leave it to the stock market to determine the fair value of Mondelez. But let me provide some perspective. The pickup of $0.10 in EPS due to translation clearly adds to be great progress we have made as a company I believe over the last three years. And it is fair to say that while the valuation has improved in the last three years, we still stand behind in terms of peer average and best in class. And so that gap hopefully over time will close. When I consider the brands that we have, the geographic portfolio, the category exposure, our track record over the last three years, I would say, that we are well positioned and I would assume that over time that should be reflected in our valuation and the same conclusion quite frankly is with some of the parts. So I think when I step back and I look at the quality of EPS, the $0.10 of EPS that we're adding at current spot rate, I think there should be upside, but obviously I leave it to the market to decide. I think you had also a point about transaction ForEx, what we call transaction ForEx, and that clearly transaction ForEx is a benefit for all the businesses we have around the world. But remember, we are covered entities embedded into the guidance we gave. So hopefully, I addressed a couple of points you were asking. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please go ahead. Chris Growe : I just wanted to ask you, if I could and I have just been following on the discussion you've had around costs and pricing. I guess just from a high level, do you expect pricing to offset inflation for the year, you did talk about pricing kind of catching up with costs? And then just to think about would pricing as it's been typical represent roughly half of your organic revenue growth for the year, would that be a reasonable assumption for the year? Luca Zaramella : Yeah. Maybe there would be a little bit more - a slightly more component of pricing, given the fact that, as we said, there is a timing effect in Q4 that should be fully recuperated into 2021, but I don't think it is going to be a major one, I think the 50-50 split is still something that is plausible, maybe in Q1, it will be a little bit less. I think to your question about are you offsetting all your costs. I think the number one qualifier should be with or without COVID. And without COVID and the fact that COVID is subsiding, we would be fully expecting the cost inflation over time as we enter the year and as we get close to the end of 2021, I expect the run rate of gross profit to be at the same level as we would have been without COVID, so that has always been the intention. Over time, we want to be price disciplined, we will price our inflation and we believe that is one of the building blocks of us being able to invest more in the company. Chris Growe : Okay, thank you for that color. And then I just had a quick follow on. You've talked about implementing a pretty meaningful SKU reduction program. And I just want to get a sense and maybe perhaps this fits in with that answer, but does that provide - is that occurring as you expected and is that a of volume weight for the year, but you're seeing a much better mix improvement, I just want to get a sense of where we stand on the SKU reduction program? Dirk Van de Put : Okay. Yes, the short answer to that is, yes. We are on track and it's really part of a broader simplification program in order to drive both top line and bottom line. So it's a reduction of SKUs, reduction of the number of innovation initiatives, we are doing bigger innovation initiatives and then also a strategic review of our brands. We are aiming for 25% reduction in every region, there is no SKU to one category or another. And so in the sense that what we have stopped manufacturing so we don't make any more - we've already achieved a double-digit reduction in '20, I need to take into account for instance that in Europe those changes can only be done in the first quarter of the New Year so they are going to do their SKU reductions right now. And we also have to do reduction right now because we are protecting our shelf space and try to minimize waste. And so we will - going forward once we reach the level we were aiming for - to keep the lower SKU count and we're going to apply a very strict one-in one-out approach to new products. We - important to mention is probably that we are not expecting any negative top line effect since this 25% only represent 2%, 3% and keeping our shelf space we should be fine. And going forward, there is a number of benefits as it relates to less complexity in manufacturing, for instance, better customer service, reduction of our inventories. And so we - and also more sales we - which seems to have more space for our top selling SKU. So it's going to support the delivery over the long-term algorithm. It won't be transformative from a margin perspective to our opinion though. It will help, it will improve, but it's not that you will see a massively improved gross margin. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Rob Dickerson : Thanks so much for fitting me in. Dirk, I guess this is a broader question kind of just in terms of portfolio position going forward, obviously you continue to do very well with the brands that you have, but at the same time we've seen some new innovation with gluten-free cookie, gluten-free Oreo recently and then obviously the full acquisition of Hu, you continue to call out that well-being, sustainability is obviously a focus. One could argue that kind of over time even if your core brands to do well, but there's still a lot of opportunity in distribution opportunity kind of more in that kind of well-being side. So just kind of, maybe if you could just spend a little time just providing some color kind of how you think about that internally, how do you leverage your capabilities in R&D survey work, what have you to kind of always make sure that you are on trend going forward with the brands you have, but now also with the new brands and then maybe if you could kind of tie-in then how you will also be thinking about go forward acquisition opportunities kind of, of course of the core or still kind of maybe a little bit broader on the well-being side? And that's it. Thanks. Dirk Van de Put : Okay. It links in a little bit with that question about SKU. So the way we look at it is if we launch new SKUs or new sub-brands or new brands or by brands, they need to have a certain level of sales right now and they need to have the potential to grow to a certain level. So as you do that analysis, there is certainly an amount of health and wellness in that mix, but it certainly wouldn't be, to be honest at this stage, the majority of what we do. Every year, it's more, but we are trying to very carefully manage the balance between more indulgence and more health and wellness to - over time in order to keep our mixed growth rate, if I can call it like that, because what you have is that health and wellness is growing faster but it's smaller. And so if you look at mixed growth rate, we need to do both and at the moment we need to do a lot more of indulgence. As it relates to how we are thinking about it from an innovation, R&D and an acquisition perspective, clearly, we want to continue to increase our exposure to health and wellness. And particularly if we think about the next 10 years, let's say, I do expect that that mix shift between indulgence and health and wellness will continue to balance more and more versus health and wellness, we will accompany that mix and so we need to launch more and acquire more in that sense. The big areas that we are looking at internally with our R&D team and also externally is, one is an example of Oreo gluten-free, has to see with the ingredients, the nutritional composition, what can we improve, how can we gradually get products that the health-conscious consumers are more interested in. So it's sort of an upgrading of our current portfolio. And then we do have a number of products in market very, very small tests with products we developed our sales in-house, completely new, breakthrough type of products, new brands that will take time to develop, but we are also in there and that goes much further than sort of cleaning up your ingredient or improving your ingredient panel. And then the we use mainly acquisitions to really take a big foothold in some of the big health and wellness space, so perfect bar is considered one of the healthiest bars in the market, then Hu is very particularly focused on the paleo vegan segment and we will continue to do that in the U.S. and around the world. And those are sort of the big lines of what we have - we're trying to do. There is a number of other areas that are going on, so for instance, portion control we think is part of health and wellness, so over time, we are trying to reduce the portions that we sell or that the consumer consumes, we talked about the better for you credentials but all natural is another one that is quite big, local sourcing in a way the consumer is considering as healthy and then there is of course the functional benefits, energy bites and things like that. So what I would say the big groups of what we are focused on health and wellness were the ones that I was going through before. But yeah, you will see a very balanced approach and gradually introducing more health and wellness products from our side. Operator : And there are no more questions at this time. Dirk Van de Put : I think that's the end. Yes, sorry go ahead. Operator : And there are no more questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back to management for closing remarks. Dirk Van de Put : I was jumping the gun here. Well, thank you very much for your time, your interest in the company. We feel good where we've ended 2020. We feel good about 2021. We have momentum. We feel we are coming from a position of strength. And so we hope to be able to provide you some good news as we go through the year. Thank you. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, everyone. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day and welcome to the Mondelez International First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour including remarks by Mondelez management and the question-and-answer session.  I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondelez. Please go ahead, sir. Shep Dunlap : Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van De Put, our Chairman and CEO and Luca Zaramella, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides which are available on our website. Dirk Van De Put : Thank you, Shep and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. We had a strong start to the year despite lapping our highest growth quarter in 2020 and Q1 reconfirmed that we are emerging from COVID even stronger. Our performance demonstrates that our strategy is working and that we have clear growth opportunities in front of us. We are driving a virtuous cycle and producing a consistent track record of growth. As we continue to deliver on our commitments, we are also strengthening our business by accelerating investments, reshaping our portfolio and simplifying the business while maintaining cost discipline. We are well positioned to accelerate long-term revenue and earnings growth. On slide five, let me walk you through the headlines of our financial results. Top line growth was 3.8% underpinned by broad based share gains, and excellent execution across all geographies, categories and brands. Our teams around the world delivered amazing results with events like Chinese New Year and Easter being clear standards. In turn, the strong volume and price driven top line translated into gross profit dollar growth of 5%, also aided by our emerged stronger cost initiatives. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Dirk and good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter performance was strong across all key financial metrics, building off the strength and momentum of 2020. Revenue grew 3.8%, driven by broad based growth and a healthy balance of price and volume. On a two-year average basis, we grew for 5.1%. Emerging market performance was strong with growth of 10% for the quarter and more than 7% on a two-year basis. Quarter-one marks, for emerging market, a solid comeback from the impact of COVID and proves that our geographical footprint is a long-term sustainable competitive advantage. These results include double-digit growth in Brazil, India and China, as well as high-single digit increase in Russia. In developed markets, we continue to see solid consumption and are pleased with our performance given the elevated demand in the previous year quarter. These markets were in positive growth territory for the quarter while the two-year average growth was 4%. Turning to slide 14, and performance by category. Biscuits grew plus 3.4% in Q1 and plus 7.6% on a two-year average. Each of our BRIC countries delivered double-digit growth during the quarter, while our large US business posted low-single digit growth against very elevated growth from the previous year. The Oreo brand once again was a clear winner with nearly double-digit growth. Chocolate grew more than 10% for the quarter, with a two-year average of 6.5%. Our large chocolate countries such as India, the UK, Germany, Brazil and Russia, all turned in strong results. We are particularly pleased with our Easter performance, considering that mobility restrictions are still in place, for instance, in Europe. From a brand perspective, both Cadbury Dairy Milk and Milka grew double digit. Gum and candy continued to see the impact of restricted mobility. This business declined approximately 16% during the quarter and 8% on a two-year basis. Comparisons will become easier as we move into the second quarter, though we are expecting a gradual recovery. Now, I'll cover our market share performance on slide 15. We continue to see good share performance. Given the unique impact of COVID on results, we have switched to a two-year cumulative for percentage of revenue gaining or holding share, as we feel it better depict how we are truly doing. In Q1, we had or gained share in 80% of our revenue. Biscuits and chocolate were the big drivers holding or gaining share in 85% of our revenue base. Gum and candy helped or gain in 35%. Operator :  Your first question comes from a lot of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please go ahead. Andrew Lazar : Great. Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. Luca Zaramella : Hi, Andrew. Dirk Van De Put : Hi, Andrew. Andrew Lazar : First off, maybe Dirk, can you talk a little bit about how you feel about the durability of the emerging market performance, given the strength that you saw in the quarter, obviously, with all that is going on in so many of those emerging markets currently? Dirk Van De Put : Yes. Well, just to put the numbers back in front of us. So it's about 10% of growth in the quarter and then 7% on average for the last two years. It was broad based with double-digit growth in Brazil, in India, in China and in Russia, or high-single digit in Russia, sorry. And the contribution to the growth was coming from our global brands and from our local brands. So I would say strong across the board. Maybe some of the countries where we have gum and candy business a little bit less, but we are talking about Mexico or some of the Central American countries or Thailand but not the big emerging markets. Obviously, the big question is what's going to happen with COVID in these big markets, and is it going to affect the consumer? So if I go through them one by one, China is operating well. COVID is under control, I would say. There is a return to mobility and if there is a rise in COVID cases, they lockdown quickly an area, contract trace and then - contact trace, sorry, and move on. So I think China, we can be relatively sure that that is going to continue. The next one, India, the performance was very strong in the first quarter. But at the same time, we've seen near the end of the quarter and then into the second quarter big rise in cases driven by religious festivities, state elections and probably some fatigue. At the moment, the restrictions are only about 10%, so 10% of the population is under severe lockdown. And these lower type of restrictions do not materially affect the access to our products. But if the restrictions would be more expanded that could give us some pockets of disruption to our opinion, but overall, I think life continues. People clearly have migrated to our brands, which are trusted brands and they offer a lot of food safety also. So we're expecting a strong quarter in India, even in the current circumstances for Q2. And then Brazil, as you know, Q1 was heavily affected by COVID. We still have a serious impact. But we see chocolate and biscuit consumption clearly growing. But of course, the gum and candy is still impacted by the lockdowns. In Brazil, just like in the other countries, we're seeing very positive trends in our market shares also. And then Russia, I would say is also in a relatively difficult COVID situation, but it does not affect consumption. So I feel confident that in these four biggest BUs and then some of the other ones, we will be able to sustain growth and there's a number of underlying factors that will drive that. One would be, for instance, distribution expansion in China, we've added 500,000 stores over the last two years. In India, we've done about 360,000 stores. We have huge opportunity in getting to more stores, as I was talking about in the call before. And then India is entering to the choco of bakery space to where we think there's a big opportunity and our biscuit business is growing very fast. So I think also based on those factors that we feel we feel strong about the emerging markets. Andrew Lazar : Thanks so much for that. And just this - oh, yeah. Dirk Van De Put : Maybe, one thing Andrew, because this is maybe the moment to talk about COVID and the India situation, as a side remark. But obviously, our hearts go out with everybody in India and the struggle that the country is going through. The safety of our colleagues is our number one priority and we are giving all the supports we can to a local team. And this week, we are going to donate at least $2 million to the government and to the healthcare workers to provide critical medical infrastructure like oxygenators and other equipment. So I just wanted to make sure that we are aware of what's going on in India and as a company, we are planning to do whatever we can to help. Andrew Lazar : Yep. Of course, thank you for that. And Luca, just a quick one, given 1Q organic sales growth was obviously very strong and above the full year expectation and it was against the toughest year ago comp, I guess could the 3% plus full year organic sales growth outlook prove potentially conservative, and I guess, potentially also give you more comfort, obviously, in your margin expectations, in a rising sort of inflationary environment? Luca Zaramella : Yeah. So we are clearly encouraged by the strong start to the year and the quality of our results. It's remarkable to see share gains continuing volume and price, both contributing in a meaningful way to top line and profitability and free cash flow are ahead of last year. As Dirk just said, we are very happy with emerging markets that has truly come back since the peak of the COVID crisis last year in Q2, and the last three quarters over there had been aligned in terms of trends to the pre-COVID levels or even better. And same goes for developed markets that, for which consumption is higher than the 2019 baseline. So we are optimistic about the fundamentals and the ability that we have to execute a 2021 plan. But we know, as Dirk just said in India, there is some volatility and we want to make sure that we don't get ahead of ourselves and so reaffirming our original plan, at this point, we believe is really the right approach. Having said that, you're right, we are going cautiously optimistic about the ability to over-deliver versus the original guidance. But I want to make sure that we don't get ahead of ourselves, it is early in the year. But just to reassure that we have all the investments aligned in the plan. And actually, we have unlocked some additional investments, particularly in places where I think the situation is experiencing great momentum. In terms of inflation, there is more inflation coming. And so profitability is great in Q1, we believe we are going to hit the numbers as we had originally in mind, but the higher inflation will require some additional pricing and some additional productivities to offset the impact, which I believe at this point is absolutely manageable, given that all these positions are pretty much hedged for 2021. And so as I said, profitability should be good, in line with what we told you at the end of last quarter. And we feel like we can price away the inflation and commit again to a high single digit EPS as per the original guidance. Andrew Lazar : Thanks so much. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Andrew. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ken Goldman with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Ken Goldman : Hi, thank you. Luca Zaramella : Hi, Ken. Dirk Van De Put : Hi. Ken Goldman : Hi. You've done a number of bolt-on acquisitions in the last couple of years, you highlighted them today. Nothing on the larger side and I understand, you've been pretty clear, you're not really looking to buy anything sizable. But if a larger asset became available, would you consider it or is it really something that's not on your radar right now? Is it just something where you're still committed to those smaller size targets for now? Dirk Van De Put : No, we remain on our strategy, which is the snacking world basically. And we want to execute any acquisition, small or big, clearly, as it should help us to accelerate our overall growth rate. So we want to stay in snacking and we want to accelerate our growth rate. So we know where that needs to come from. It has to come from the adjacencies, some of the geographical whitespaces, and some of the fast-growing segments that we have in our current market. So if there would be a larger acquisition that would provide us the opportunity to get bigger in snacking or get an accelerated - and/or get an accelerated growth rate, we're certainly open to it. But it's just very difficult to find and we're hesitant. We would probably be open to get into other areas of snacking but we are hesitant to get into other food categories, which are showing less growth. And so that makes it much more difficult to find the right sizable acquisitions. But it's absolutely not the case that we are not open to it, we're totally open to it. Ken Goldman : Understood. Thank you for that. And then very quickly, you mentioned that the February storms hurt your operating margin in North America. I don't think you quantified that. I know it's tough to be precise sometimes. But is there any way we can sort of think about how much that affected your margin this quarter? It's important just as we think about what the non-recurring versus recurring impacts were? Thank you for that. Dirk Van De Put : Yeah, it had a disruption in February. Unless you wanted to go Luca? Luca Zaramella : No, no. Go ahead, Dirk. Dirk Van De Put : Yeah. Yeah. We had the disruption in February from the Texas storm, but we had a good stock rebuilt in March. So I would say that the effect for us has been limited. I mean, at the moment itself in February, we saw it clearly. And so those sales that we lost there will not come back but it's not going to have a major impact on the year, I would say. Ken Goldman : Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Robert Moskow : Hi, thank you. I noticed that Brazil had much better numbers than what we're used to seeing and I remember you put new management in place in Brazil. Can you give a little more color on what you think the team is doing right there? How sustainable those improvements are? And is there any kind of a model for your other LatAm countries to follow here or do you think just the environment in Brazil is just more amenable than the others? Thanks. Dirk Van De Put : Yes. Yes, Brazil has been doing better, like Luca said already, for several quarters now. It grew double digit in Q1 and we are expecting good growth again in Q2, and all that within a situation where COVID cases are increasing dramatically. One thing to keep into account before I talk about all the good things that management has been doing is that the composition of our product range in Brazil is fundamentally different from a Mexico or what we call VACAM , which is Colombia, Peru, Chile and Central America. Those Mexico and VACAM have a very important share of their business is driven by gum and candy. And as a consequence, they suffer more in this crisis. Brazil has a bigger biscuits and chocolate business, and they're doing quite well, increasing market share. We've stepped up investments. We've also improved our customer service. I think the team also has increased or improved their internal process in a big way, made the business much simpler to manage. They've brought in some extra talent. So yes, clearly management is driving a change in the way the business is operating and it's showing in the results. I would say for the other businesses, the problem is different from what we had in Brazil. We were not performing in the Brazilian market in biscuits and chocolate. It's largely in Mexico and VACAM, we need to make sure that the gum and candy business comes back. And so we will see how that goes. We see it come back step by step, but it's going to take a while. Robert Moskow : Okay, a follow up on chewing gum. Is there any kind of earnings dilution number in your head that you would find acceptable, if you were to divest your developed market chewing gum business? And also how would you go about splitting it up that by keeping your brands in DMs and also, if you were to divest, exit the brands in DM, in developed markets? Dirk Van De Put : I can let Luca maybe talk about the dilution that. Our developed market business is not that big and he can talk about that. But splitting it up, I don't think is from a brand perspective, a major issue, it exists with many brands that one company owns a brand in one area and then owns it in another area. It's probably a little bit more difficult but doable, as it relates to the supply chain and where the products are being produced. But we think that those factories can stay with the different regions. And then R&D, I think an agreement can always be made that our R&D team continues to provide service and any innovation we do on our brands in one part of the world, we can extend that to the other part of the world, if needed. So I think from an operational standpoint, splitting it up, it's doable. It's not - I mean, it's not a walk in the park, but it's something that I think our teams can manage quite well. Luca? Luca Zaramella : I think on dilution, quite frankly, it is a little bit premature to talk about what it could be. I mean, we are assessing multiple options and even within certain scenarios, it might be not an outright sale and so we have multiple options ahead of us. And quite candidly, we are assessing all of them. So we haven't decided yet. It is 2% of the business, 5% overall, 2% when you look at only emerging market. And we believe, in general terms, that if we had to go down the path of a sale of the business, the increased focus and the outcomes that we could drive through our existing biscuits and chocolate business will overtime offset and obviously, we're not going to sell anything below the key value. Those are key fundamental principles that we apply all the times and we will apply even this time. Robert Moskow : Thank you for the color. Appreciate it. Luca Zaramella : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Dara Mohsenian with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Dara Mohsenian : Hi, guys. Dirk Van De Put : Hi, Dara. Luca Zaramella : Hi, Dara. Dara Mohsenian : So a couple questions. First, you mentioned your ability to price to offset higher commodity costs. I'm wondering if the pressure continues to build incrementally on those fronts going forward. Can you talk about your ability to take pricing in emerging markets where in theory, there's a weaker consumer post-COVID and just how you think about that on a regional basis in some of the key emerging markets relative the pricing power in developed markets in the US and Europe? Luca Zaramella : Yeah, maybe I'll start. So I think we are overall starting with a position of strength in our franchises. We have invested quite a bit in the last few years with our consumers and our customers and we are delivering value for both consumers and end customers overall. We have a strong portfolio of brands. We have invested in working media in - that is going double digit, sales execution, route to market and in capital in our facilities. Having said that, there is higher inflation in the marketplace and if you look even at this quarter, the composition of pricing and volume, pricing is a little bit more pronounced than it has been historically. So we are pricing more and we are pricing away inflation. We are not necessarily going all the time with least price increases, we use a lot of revenue growth management techniques within the company. Those provide a better impact for consumers an elasticity. We will protect pre-price points, particularly in emerging markets. And that price-backed architecture is a key element of price increases throughout both emerging markets and developed markets. We are clearly optimizing promo spending. We are optimizing mix, mix is still negative in quarter one because of gum and World Travel Retail. But when you strip that out, and you look at biscuit and chocolate, it is better than it has been in the past. And also, we want to improve trade deals ROI. So to cut it short, we feel confident that we can price away inflation. And we are never going for the big bang, depending on what the current situation is in terms of commodities and ForEx. But it is a gradual implementation of pricing over time. And obviously, given where we stand in terms of overall inflation, as we go into next year, we would have to price. Dara Mohsenian : Okay, that's helpful. And then from a market share standpoint, it looks like the momentum continued in Q1 on a two-year basis. Can you give us a little more of a near term update of what you're seeing in March and April, as you cycle some of the incremental share gains from last year? And are you seeing any competitive response in the marketplace to the share gains you've seen recently? I guess indirectly that ties the first question around pricing but I'd be curious for competitive response and what you're seeing from competitors. Thanks. Dirk Van De Put : Yes. So overall, I would say, for this year, we are expecting modest gains on the back of the very strong gains that we had last year but we do expect to continue to increase our market share. In Q1, on a global basis, we continue to increase our share, not as strong as last year, but still quite good, more than then it has been in the past. Of course, as we get into March and April, and in some countries, we don't have the full results yet. That's where we start to lap some of our largest step up in share gains that we had last year. And so it's a bit too early for us to say how that's going to pan out. But overall, we do expect a good year. And the reason being is that some of the things we're doing, like distribution increase, execution against seasonals, increase in our investments, the ROI you're seeing on some of our marketing is all pointing in the around - sorry, in the right direction. And so we believe that the basis there is to continue gaining shares. Another one that I didn't mention but there is increased penetration of our brands. In the last 12 months, we have about 150 million households globally that are now consuming our products. So I don't think that's going to go away right away and that is going to be the base that is going to help us to continue to gain share. We think it's more helpful since we have a big step-up last year and we will in some markets give back a little bit, I'm assuming in the coming months. So I think the net result of the two years is what is most important. That's why we thought it would be better to start showing the two-year cumulative share. As I said before, we have all the right things in place. We saw in a continuation of that in Q1 and we think that we still will have a good year. Dara Mohsenian : Great, thank you so much. It is helpful. Dirk Van De Put : Yeah. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : So I wanted to just follow back up on the question around - the questions around portfolio and the gum business and I guess two questions there. First one is just the slide where you've, you've talked about a billion dollars of revenue from the acquisitions, are they're contributing a billion of revenue? Can you give us a sense of just what the profit contribution is and where - maybe where that stands relative to what you thought you were when you made the acquisition, just trying to get a better understanding of just how accretive it's been to returns or contribution to profit growth? Dirk Van De Put : Yes, so the - I would say, the group of acquisition is all along strategy, but it's very different of where in the development these different brands are. So the profit contribution is largely depending on how big and where we are in the development. So to give you the two extremes, potentially Give & Go, mature business, strong profitability, growing high single digits in the first quarter, so a big contribution to our profitability. On the other spectrum, I would say, Hu, smaller brands, still investing in getting distribution, in getting the brand build up. Huge potential, biggest or fastest selling chocolate brand in Whole Foods, but we need to build up distribution, so for the time being, we probably going to run a loss on Hu, as we build up the brand. All the other ones, I would say, if I think about Perfect Snacks, Grenade, and Tate's, they all have strong EBITDA, in line or above with the EBITDA of the company. And they are in sort of the 100 million to 150 million mark in sales. And so they all have huge distribution opportunities, which we are continuing to build with them. And so our expectation is that they are profitable, that they will contribute to our overall profitability but that's not the main role, their main role is to grow as fast as we possibly can. So hopefully, that gives you an idea how we think about it. Bryan Spillane : Yeah, that's helpful. And then, Luca, maybe just the follow up on Rob Moskow's question, as we're thinking about the potential options for gum, just tax leakage or cash, cash tax return or cash returns, because your model has been very effective at existing businesses in a very tax advantaged way over time. And so if you could just kind of maybe give us a little bit color, how we should think about those considerations? Is that - the cost basis in this business goes all the way back to when Cadbury bought Adams, right? So I don't even know what the cost basis is but as we're thinking about exit vehicles, we really think about tax efficiency and maybe those types of structures. And, again, this is a business that could be worth, I guess, a billion and a half or more. So just trying to understand how we should think about cash, the cash inflow potential. Luca Zaramella : The situation varies upon the structure we're going to use and it will be different between the US and in Europe. I would say, overall, the tax leakage is manageable if we had to go down that path. And I want to reiterate, it's not a foregone conclusion at this point but there will be some tax leakage potentially. Again, in the big scheme of things, I think it is something that we can handle. And it will depend upon the structure we might end up using and how the value is located between Europe and US. Bryan Spillane : Okay, thank you. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Bryan. Operator : Your next question is from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. David Palmer : Thanks. You cited how you've been gaining share in most of your business but you also cited that the core category growth has been 3% or so. So it's not too far behind where you have been. In other words, global sweet snacks has been extremely resilient during this entire pandemic. Could you speak to that? Do you think that there's parts? You know, obviously, you've talked about gum and World Travel Retail as being headwind areas, but there might be others that are tailwinds, like, Oreos in the US, for example. Roll it up for us. Do you think that this pandemic has been a net headwind to your business, and something you can get back in future quarters as a tailwind and I have a follow-up? Dirk Van De Put : I would say the Beauty of our businesses that despite everything that that happened, we're very balanced. And if you look at it, we grew 3.7% last year. We are growing 3.8% in the first quarter of this year. Last year, we saw big gains in biscuits and in chocolate, but we had gum and candy really going the opposite way. We had emerging markets slowing down but developed markets stepping up. So the balance, the net balance, and I keep on referring to that, the net balance has been that in the end for us, there has not been that big of an effect and that continues into Q1. Now thinking it through what's going to happen going forward. I believe that it could probably be a tailwind. And the reason why and I'm talking, let's call it, two years from now, in emerging markets, things will come back, mobility will come back and we see big growth in snacking. This quarter, as they came back, emerging markets were growing close to 10% for us. So I think there is momentum in emerging markets, emerging markets are growing 7% on average over the last two years. There is momentum there. And as they get through COVID and the consumer gets back in into their normal life, I think we will see a benefit to that. In developed markets, I think consumers will use this as a change in the way they live. And they will not spend as much time in the office and they will spend more time at home. And we clearly know that, as a consumer spends more time at home that benefits are categories, particularly biscuits but also chocolate. So if I think about it, not immediately in the next year, because there will still be a lot of ins and outs, but during the crisis, it was kind of a neutral effect. Getting out of it, I think it's going to have a tailwind for us. David Palmer : Thanks. That's great. And you have such a multifaceted growth agenda. You've talked about a lot of this stuff during the slides, brand bolt-ons, underpenetrated channel push and global Oreo expansion, adjacencies and like. Is there - it's been a kind of a wild year even already with inflation ramping up and you've heard about supply chain disruptions, whatever, and obviously, the COVID cases in some of your emerging markets. Are your plans at all changing about what you are pushing harder on this year in leaning into? And I'll pass it on. Dirk Van De Put : I mean, overall, we feel that our strategy that we laid out in the second half of '18 still is very valid. We've made some adaptations to it during the crisis. And at the moment we are reviewing it to see if we can build on sort of another level of sophistication and an understanding of what really drives it but the basics are still there. I would say that the areas where we we've been working on, for sure, is simplifying the business more. We have too many SKUs, too many small innovations and so on and that makes life really complicated for our teams and for supply chain, so we've been focused on that. We're also starting to understand our marketing approach better and better. Our brands are really thriving. I think teams have done an incredible job in better understanding purpose of our brands and really then making it come alive. We get great returns on our investments. And so I think we're going to continue that and try to lift that to the next level. As it relates to channels, for sure, we have to adapt our strategy, e-commerce 77% growth in the first quarter after already a big boom last year. So e-commerce, I think in the coming years, will continue to grow very fast. We think discounters is another area that will be important. And we will have to see where the balance between grocery and big stores versus on the go and away from home will pan out, and that might require some adaptations. So I would say, overall, the list of opportunities that we have to grow has not changed and has reconfirmed itself. We might change the sort of the weight or the priority of it, but the ones I went through in the presentation are still very valid. And the enablers of the growth are still very valid and are working for us. So it's more about prioritization than changes to my opinion. David Palmer : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Alexia Howard : Hello there. Luca Zaramella : Hi. Dirk Van De Put : Hi. Alexia Howard : Hello there. So, first of all, on the last earnings call, I think to remember, gross margins were down, I think about 80 basis points year-on-year and there was some trepidation expressed about how gross margins would develop this quarter. Clearly, they came through better than expected, flat year-on-year on and adjusted basis. Could I ask just what happened that came through better than you anticipated? Was it just pricing relative to input costs in Latin America or was there something more to it? And then I have a follow up? Luca Zaramella : Yeah, I mean, as we saw inflation spiking, we have been doing a little bit more pricing and optimizing the overall revenue growth management mix and so that's part of the answer. We have delivered the great quarter in terms of productivity. The colleagues that we have around the world working on supply chain have done a remarkable job. And, the goal for us is really to make sure that while protecting all employees around the world, COVID costs are pretty much absorbed by productivity and happy to report that in the quarter, the COVID costs were only inverted commas, obviously $25 million. And then I think overall, when you look at the composition of profitability, we are very pleased with increasing profitability, you see, not only in Latin America, which I think is quite good and that is on the back of our teams in Brazil, for instance, optimizing returns on Easter, that are this year, at historical lows compared to last year. But also and importantly, all the volume leverage that came through EMEA, which is again proving to us if we didn't know that, while this company has tremendous potential in revenue, that revenue, if it comes to the right mix of price and volume, it delivers tremendous upside to the bottom line. And also, as you saw Alexia, in terms of cash flow. So, it was better than we anticipated. I think it was better because again, we priced a bit more, productivities came in strongly, and importantly, particularly in EMEA, but not only volume was strong and it was also the case obviously in EU and in the US when you look at the two-year stock on profit. I think we can call ourselves happy with the delivery of that. Alexia Howard : Great. And just as a quick follow up. You called out unfavorable mix as a negative on the organic sales growth. Was that specifically just gum related or was it also World Travel Retail, just curious about how those - that mix is likely to develop over time. Luca Zaramella : Overall, when you look at total mix, it is because of gum and it is because of World Travel Retail. Then obviously, North America commands a little bit higher profitability than other places and obviously didn't go as much as other places this quarter. But overall, I would say when you look at the fundamentals of mix management, we feel quite good, both in chocolate and biscuit, and hopefully gum and World Travel Retail will come back certainly, we will start lapping better numbers in the second part of the year. Alexia Howard : Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Alexia. Operator : Your next question is from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey, good evening, folks. Thank you. Luca Zaramella : Hi, Jason. Dirk Van De Put : Hi, Jason. Jason English : I think - look, I think you partially answered this in the answer to last question, but I want to make sure I got it right. On EMEA, this is the highest margin I think we've ever seen from that business with substantial growth. If it's all volume leverage, is it fair to underwrite like this is a sustainable profit level, maybe not every quarter, but this is not sort of unusual that we have to reset lower. And then on the flip side, it's been a couple of years since we've seen an EBIT margin below 20% in North America. It sounds like in an answer to Ken Goldman's question like this, whether disruption was kind of a net loss, what drove the margin pressure there? Thank you. Luca Zaramella : So, Jason, the simple answer on EMEA and the remarkable 37% increase that you saw, it is because we have good profitability in India and China that delivered amazing growth in Q1. When we look at the P&L structure of these two companies, it is a sound P&L that allows for reinvestment. And so that came after we invested more in advertising. And again, I want to stress the fact that emerging markets can be profitable, can be cash accretive and EMEA is the point in time. We come from a place where we have invested in supply chain and we have great state of the art facilities in both India and China, as a specific example. And putting volume on top of it is, is just going to yield great results also going forward. So that's really, when we say emerging markets in action, you look at the EMEA P&L and you realize how that can really come to fruition not only in this quarter, but for the years to come and so it is a structural advantage. We just have to keep on being disciplined in pricing and delivering volume. And I think things will take care of themselves if we continue investing in route to market and Dirk gave you the idea of the opportunities that we still have in these places, whether it is biscuits, for instance, in India or whether it is number of stores in China and chocolate, obviously. I think in North America, I wouldn't get overly concerned about the margins. I think North America obviously this quarter is facing some additional pressure in terms of logistics costs. And you will all know that edible oils, sweet, et cetera, they had been going up in terms of cost. But we are taking the necessary measures to optimize profitability and total dollar delivery a little bit more. Again, I don't want to take away the fact that only two-year average, when you look at the net benefit versus '19, it is still a 17% - 16% OI increase versus the 2019 baseline which again, I think is quite good. Jason English : For sure. Thank you. I'll leave it there. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Jason. Operator : And your final question is from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please go ahead. Chris Growe : Hi, good evening. Thanks for the time here. I know we're getting overtime. I just had two follow on from earlier questions. I want to ask first of all, we think about the organic revenue for the year, it's clear, you're taking a little bit more pricing due to the inflation picking up. As we think about the balance of volume versus pricing, it sounds like price is going to be a larger contributor. Have you given a little more color around how much that could contribute to organic revenue growth for the year? Luca Zaramella : So we come from a place last year where if you look at the numbers, it was 50 :50, I think it will be slightly more. Again, I think we need to look at the fundamentals of how we want to run this company. Volume is integral part of the incentive scheme for the countries and for us obviously at the center and for the regions too. It is clearly a key contributor in places like EMEA where we have tremendous leverage potential. There might be other places where we will have to price a little bit more and there will be some volume consequences. So I think you will see still volume growth, it might be slightly less than what happened last year. And importantly, both volume, market share and gross profit dollars are critical part of the incentive scheme. And so it will be the optimization of the three elements that will eventually determine how much we will deliver in pricing versus volume. Remember, also in the second part of the year, we will start lapping meaningful volume declines in gum and World Travel Retail and the simple year-over-year comparison should have that partially offset potentially by tougher comparisons in developed markets, particularly in North America. So I feel quite good in telling you that the balancing will still be there. Maybe it will be a little bit more tilted to price this year. Chris Growe : Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. Then just one quick follow on. We've talked about high growth segments and adjacencies. Most of your M&A activity has been in the US for those six transactions you outline there. Is there a more heavier focus for you outside the US? You had one recently in the UK, is there - are you looking outside the US for more of that sort of high growth segment or adjacency for the business and that's all I have. Thank you. Dirk Van De Put : Yes, in fact, we did. In this year, we did three and two were outside of the US; one in Australia, one in Europe. I would say the focus that we have is as much internationally as in the US, there's no clear preference. Probably in the past, things have moved faster in North America than in the rest of the world but we see a good pipeline, good conversations going on. So in the end, you can expect a good balance between the two. Dirk Van De Put : I think that's it. Well thank you very much for your attention to our earnings. Thank you very much for your investment in the company and for your interest in the company. We obviously look forward to a great continuation of the year and looking forward to talk to you in the coming weeks. Thank you. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, everyone.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Mondelez International Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Mondelez management and the question-and-answer session.  I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondelez. Please go ahead, sir. Shep Dunlap : Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. With me today are; Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO; and Luca Zaramella, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. Dirk Van de Put : Thanks, Shep, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. Firstly, I want to acknowledge our colleagues, our suppliers and our customers around the world who continue to navigate through the pandemic, particularly in markets where COVID vaccines are not yet widely available. We continue to work hard to accelerate access to vaccines for our colleagues, and sincerely appreciate everyone's efforts to maintain the supply and availability of our products. We had a strong first half executing our strategy well and leveraging our advantaged enablers to deliver against our growth drivers. The strong first half gives us the confidence to raise our full year revenue growth outlook to 4%-plus. We are seeing improving mobility trends in many places, helping to drive recovery in areas such as world travel retail and Gum & Candy that was negatively impacted last year. We also see continued strong demand for the categories and channels that experienced elevated demand last year due to COVID. Once again, this quarter, we have demonstrated that our strategy is working as it is driving a virtuous cycle that is consistently delivering a profitable, volume-driven top line and bottom line growth, as well as good returns to our shareholders. We are leveraging our revenue growth management capability which is particularly important in this inflationary environment to generate fuel for continued investment in our brands and capabilities. And we continue to reshape our portfolio to further increase our focus on snacking as well as to accelerate our long-term growth rate. To this end, we announced in Q2 an agreement to acquire Chipita, which I will speak more about later. After this strong first half of the year and strong previous years, I remain even more confident that we have the right strategy and are taking the right actions to deliver continued and accelerated growth. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Dirk and good afternoon. Our second quarter performance was strong across the board. We delivered robust topline growth, healthy gross profit dollar growth that allowed reinvestment in our brands, and attractive free cash flow. Revenue for the quarter increased by 6.2%. Growth was broad based and volume-led. Pricing, which was favorable across all regions, was also a key contributor. Operator :  Your first question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Ken Goldman : Hi, thank you. Dirk, you mentioned that your plan remains prudent. You talked about global volatility. I'm curious, though, how you see the situation today in some of your key emerging markets and what your outlook is for the rest of the year. Again, I know you don't have a crystal ball, but are there any areas of the world where you might be more optimistic? More concerned? Just trying to get a sense of that? Dirk Van de Put : Okay. Thanks, Ken. And yes, a pleasure to go into that. You probably saw that we had a strong emerging market performance in Q2 with 16% growth in the quarter and now a 5% growth on a 2-year average basis. It would have been probably higher but we have disruption in India. COVID caused in May. And so if you look around I would say, look at the big markets. We have strong double digit growth in all the BRICS countries. So Brazil and Russia and then the high single-digit growth in China. So there's nothing there. I would say of those countries, there's always a potential maybe, except for China, that COVID will cause some volatility, particularly a country like India looks more susceptible to it. But overall, they seem to be on a path of a gradual increase. China, I mean, operating well. COVID seems to be under control. They are returning to mobility and we've seen a constantly improving category performance. And on top, we have strong share gains, sometimes like in Gum 3 points year-to-date. If I look at India, they bounced back in June of the crisis of April and May, and the daily cases are now at 10% of what the peak was. So, the short-term risk of further disruption remains significant due to the slow vaccine rollout and new variants. But if I look at the long-term prospects, I believe they still are very strong. And our team there is executing the strategy very well, doing more investment, increasing the range and driving more distribution. And then Brazil had very strong growth, double-digit net revenue and now also double digit on a 2-year CAGR. The COVID nervousness is still there. And then the chocolate and biscuit consumption is growing while the Gum & Candy, which, as you know, is very heavily affected by COVID, is still negative by the reduced mobility. In Brazil, we see the vaccine rollout accelerating and it's starting to have an impact. And so we expect mobility in Brazil in the second half to be quite strong. And we also see some share gains in biscuits in Brazil. So, in the big markets, I cannot say, apart from what I just said, that there would be major surprises. I would say, at this stage, Southeast Asia is particularly affected, and so that's going to take a few months probably. We have transmissions peaking in Vietnam and Indonesia. Q2 was flat against 2019, so we have to monitor that very closely. And then the Middle East and Africa, in general, they are in growth on a two-year basis, but that's also a part of the world that I would say we need to remain careful, and I don't think they have fully recovered. If I look at Latin America, the smaller markets, Mexico, slight growth on a two-year basis now. They had a tough year last year, coming back quite nicely. The rest of the smaller markets, probably not quite there yet, still below the 2019 levels. That's also driven by the fact that our Gum & Candy business is quite important in those markets. And then the European emerging markets, apart from Russia, they remain strong. So, I would say overall, there are smaller markets that are affected at the moment, but the big emerging markets are doing well. Volatility remains, but I would largely see that in India and Southeast Asia and potentially, Africa. But overall, I think the mix of our emerging markets, over time, will keep on showing more stability and a gradual increase versus 2019. Ken Goldman : That is very helpful. Thank you, Dirk. And then quickly, Luca, I was just thinking about the phasing of the third quarter and the fourth quarter from a top line perspective. As we model each of those quarters, are there any onetime maybe headwinds or tailwinds that you'd like us to consider or keep in mind? Luca Zaramella : I mean the straight answer is no. Clearly, we are very happy with the strong first half. And the 4%-plus guidance, which implies at least 3% growth for the second half, is evenly spread, I would say, between Q3 and Q4 the 3%-plus or at least 3% in the second half might appear conservative, and maybe it is given the first half trend. But as Dirk just finished talking about emerging markets, we know the situation is still volatile in certain parts of the world. And we do not know to which extent Gum & Candy and World Travel Retail will recover. So we feel quite good about the 4-plus percent. Expect the growth to be evenly spread between Q3 and Q4. Ken Goldman : Thank you. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Ken. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Good evening everybody. Luca Zaramella : Hi Andrew. Andrew Lazar : Hi there. Maybe to start with, you talked about how you obviously expect better organic revenue growth for the year and or kind of standing path on the EPS growth outlook. And I guess it's a combination of reinvestment and some additional inflation. But first off, I was hoping, Luca, you could break down those two for us. Is 1 of those two maybe a significantly larger portion of the impact to the incremental impact to margins in the back half of the year. And to the extent it's reinvestment to kind of hold up market share, given you're starting to lap some of the unprecedented market share gains from last year. What are you seeing that helps inform your ability to hold on to some of these share points or these share wins as you go forward? Thank you. Luca Zaramella : So maybe I'll start with this last one. In terms of share gains, the peak of the share gains were last year in Q2. And as we said many times, each were expanding consistent across the board. Our top countries now were middle size countries in both chocolate and biscuit posted tremendous share gains. And obviously, the 75%, 80% share gains that we're talking about, don't give full justice to the absolute amount of shares. And so, by lapping the peak last year, what I can tell you today is that, we are fairly happy with the overall result over the 2-year period. And we intend to keep it as it is as of Q2 and potentially slightly growing those share gains in the second part of the year. In terms of dynamics, the amount of A&C that we are going to invest for the second part of the year is pretty much in line with what you have seen so far in the first half. Obviously, Q2 last year, we kind of cut a little bit A&C because we were impossibilitated to do business in certain places, particularly in emerging markets. But when you look on the face of it, the increment in the second part of the year will be lower. But in terms of run rate and absolute numbers, it is absolutely in line with the first part of the year. In terms of pricing and inflation, I would say, there is going to be more in the second part of the year. To start with our pipeline of commodities and ForEx has been advantageous in the first part of the year, and we expect some commodities and ForEx impact to be relatively higher in the second part. So, there will be some more pressure in Q3 specifically. But we will continue to be very disciplined in terms of cost and pricing. And the overall goal for us is to enter 2022; A, with some strong share momentum; and 2, with some GP level that will enable continued investment. So, as I said Q3 will be more pressured than Q4. But I think at this point in time, have line of sight to incremental pricing. We have line of sight to incremental volume. And we have line of sight certainly to more of what we call RGM, which is critical for us as we continue to support our brands and with the ultimate goal to again, as I said to enter 2022 with a strong momentum. Andrew Lazar : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Nik Modi : Yes. Good afternoon everyone. So I just wanted to follow up on Andrew's question regarding share gains. And a year ago, we were talking a lot about consumer trial and household penetration? And Luca and Dirk, I was hoping you can maybe provide an update on the retention. What you're seeing from some of these new consumers. Maybe that can help us provide some perspective around the sustainability of share gains? Thank you. Dirk Van de Put : Yes. So, if I look at the household penetration in the last 12 months, globally, we have an increase of about 150 million households which we are holding on to. That is not falling back. The other area that I see is not necessarily going to lead to share gains, but I think it will lead to strong categories is this combination of an at-home consumption that is lower than it was -- slightly lower than it was last year but still significantly higher than it was in 2019. But that is then sort of buildup or there's a build-on from mobility increases. And the impulse channel coming back and giving a strong growth in Gum & Candy as well as in biscuits and chocolate. And so that, I think, would be a second factor that will influence this. And then I -- as Luca was saying, we are lapping the highest share increases that we had last year. That was, of course, a combination of our brands and the performance of our brands, but also the fact that our supply chain last year kind of worked better than some of our competitors. That effect we knew over time was going to go away. But in the second half of the year, those huge increases driven by our supply chain performance last year are gone, so we'll be lapping market share increases that are milder. And on top, we're expecting, as we did in the second quarter, but also in the third and the fourth quarter to continue to increase our working media spend in a significant way. So, I expect that also to contribute to the market share gain. So -- but what we expect to happen is that by the end of this year, the market share gains that we had at the end of last year will have retained or potentially increased a little bit. Nik Modi : Excellent. That's very helpful. And then just one last question. As we start seeing a surge in cases in the US and obviously, other pockets of the world have been not as favorable as what the US has been, are you seeing retailers behave any differently? Are they -- is there this fear that supply won't be able to come to the market if people start stocking up so they're buying inventory in early. Any context around that? Dirk Van de Put : Not really at this stage. We haven't really seen anything. It was a little bit, but not really significantly, I would say. Now, if the news continues to worsen like the CDC is saying today that even vaccinated people in certain circumstances should start to wear masks again. The fact that consumers might stay at home longer because the returning to work is not as evident after Labor Day at the moment, I think we might see a sort of a repeat of previous situations. I don't think it will lead to massive stocking at home. But the increased consumption at home, I think, will continue for a while. So, at the moment, for instance, the food consumption at home still shows a 15% spend increase versus 2019. I think that will continue well into the third quarter and potentially, in the fourth quarter. And the out-of-home eating is still not quite there. It's still 5% down, the spending there versus what it was in 2019. But the consumer is venturing out more, which also helps our snacking category. So, I think overall, our categories will benefit. But I do not expect that we will see massive sort of stocking and retailers struggling with replenishment. Nik Modi : Excellent. Thank you so much. I'll pass it on. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : Hey good afternoon everyone. Hi. Just wanted to ask a question about investment levels. I think you talked about part of the -- what's contemplated in the guidance for the full year in '21 is some incremental investment, and wanting to be in a good place to invest for '22 as well. So, I guess 2 questions around that. One is just where is the -- where are you making those product categories or which geographies? And then second, just if you give us a sense of what types of investments those are. So are they product and packaging? Is it marketing? Just trying to get an understanding of kind of where and what the investments are? Luca Zaramella : It is a combination of the strategy we had all along since the launch of the new strategy in 2018. First and foremost, it is around global brands, but also about local brands. And so, the local jewels we have around the world are all benefiting from increased A&C. It is about more working media than anything else. And so, we are reducing consistently over the last couple of years, the amount of nonworking media that we have in our plans and in our numbers. We are consistently pushing the envelope on renovation of some of these brands. And we continue investing in new packaging, in new quality, etcetera. But the overwhelming part of the investment is around working media. It is more skewed towards biscuits and chocolate, but we are also increasing, particularly in some places like China and Latin America gum investment because we want obviously to reap the benefit of increased mobility. And so, I think it is all around all these global and local brands. And that's I think paying back in terms of share gains and certainly in terms of volume and revenue growth. Bryan Spillane : Thank you. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Bryan. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow : Hi, two quick questions. The first is, have you experienced higher freight and logistics costs, did that occur in 2Q? I didn't hear it called out. And if it is, is it showing up in SG&A or is it in COGS? And then the other question was, I just want to confirm about the guidance. It's high single digit off of a higher EPS base, by about $0.03 following the restatement. So, I know you said there's a lot of reinvestment, but are you also saying that some of it -- some of this top line benefit will drop to the bottom line because -- around the order of $0.03? Thanks. Luca Zaramella : So logistics cost and freight cost is a pressure point already in Q2, and it is reported into COGS. It is, for the most part of it, a phenomenon that we saw in North America, but it is not only limited to North America. Ocean freight are really on the rise everywhere, and it is impossible pretty much to cover for a long period of time. And so we are facing pressure particularly in that area. Obviously, given the fact that we have in the US a DSD system, which is a captive system, which is on-lease trucks, etcetera, we are somewhat more insulated than others, but it is definitely a pressure point. We called out in general inflation because there is more than logistics and freight. There is also some packaging costs that is high. And in general, commerce and co-pack are rising cost with us. In terms of EPS, we have been guiding to high single-digit, that is of the base that has been restated and there is a little bit of an upside driven by the incremental revenue. But the most part of the upside is being reinvested back in the business. You might imagine, Rob, that as we might implement more pricing around the world, and given also the high share that we are retaining, we want to enter 2022, A, with strong share momentum; and B, with a level of profitability that is allowing us to continue to reinvest. And if we implement more pricing, obviously, we need more support to our brands. Robert Moskow : Great. Thank you. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Rob. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Alexia Howard : Good evening everyone. Dirk Van de Put : Hi Alexia. Luca Zaramella : Hi. Alexia Howard : Two quick questions for me. I think you mentioned in the press release that you were getting some benefit from manufacturing productivity, I'm curious if that's just operating leverage or whether there is specific manufacturing cost savings that you're seeing around the world? And if so, where those are and what's going on? And then my second question is really around just the commentary on the negative mix on both the revenues and the gross margin. I was just wondering if you were able to quantify that and qualitatively describe what's happening? Thank you. Luca Zaramella : So, in terms of net productivity, with the exclusion of commodities and ForEx costs, we include everything else in net productivity pretty much. So, labor inflation and any other type of inflation that is in there. We are benefiting from the fact that volume is growing 4.4% in the quarter, and that is providing leverage in our factories as well, obviously. But I think it's fair to say also that all the actions that we have put in place in the last few years in terms of simplification, for instance, of the portfolio, the fact that we continue to invest our CapEx mostly behind productivity initiatives is giving us benefits. And that is particularly evident in places like Latin America and EMEA that have a good rate of net productivity. Clearly, in the US, where, as I said, logistics inflation, which is part of productivity is higher is somewhat muting a bit the benefit that we are having in conversion costs. In terms of mix, I called out during the prepared remarks that as you think about World Travel Retail, which is a $0.25 billion business in 2019 or a little bit less, it is still running at 40% of what we used to be in 2019. And this is a business that runs with a much higher gross profit because it is mostly World Travel Retail, which is Toblerone and it is sold at a very premium to the rest of the portfolio. The other one, obviously, is gum. I said that it is 80% of what it used to be in 2019. It is 5% of the total revenue that we have. And again, that is a line of business that runs with a GP margin that is relatively higher to the rest of the portfolio. So I don't want to embark in giving you an exact mix number. What I can tell you is that, if we restore the business to the levels of 2019, it will be a material impact and positive impact in terms of dollars that will drop to the bottom line. As I said, think about gum running at 20% higher than it is today or world travel retail running at 60% higher than it is today, that will be a material benefit to the bottom line and to the profitability. It is fair to say that you haven't seen a big impact last year or this year, because we have been able to offset it through a lot of cost measures that are embedded into the P&L. In fact, when you look at the overhead line, we are very happy with what we have. And I think that is the reason why we're holding profit at good levels and increasing it by 10% in the first half, despite double-digit A&C. Alexia Howard : Great. Thank you very much. I\u2019ll pass it on. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Alexia. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Chris Growe : Hi. Good evening. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, Chris. Luca Zaramella : Hi, Chris. Chris Growe : Hi, guys. I just had two questions for you. The first one would just be with -- in relation to the degree of cost inflation, I'm just trying to get a sense of how it differs, if it differs between developed and emerging markets. And I guess related to that, I'm seeing very strong pricing in Latin America, a little bit more in Asia, but very limited pricing in Europe and North America to start to see that pricing pick up based on the inflation in the second half of the year. Luca Zaramella : Look, it's difficult for me to make statements about future pricing, as it boils down to segment pricing and profitability. What I would tell you is, we are seeing pressure in the commodity market. And so, what we see in commodities like sugar, edible oils, packaging material, resins costs, et cetera, those are common to all markets around the world. To that, I would add that in some developing markets, ForEx pressure is compounding. And so, if you think about the Russian ruble, there is more cost pressure in some of these developing markets. Certainly, in the US, when we look at labor costs, when we look at packaging costs, when we look at edible oils and logistics and freight, there is clearly a material impact. As I said, I don't want to start making comments about future pricing. But what I can tell you is that, in general terms, A, we have developed great capabilities around revenue growth management, and North America is most likely leading the pack in that area. And second, I will tell you that, not any different than any other segment we operate in, all the business that we have is trying to enter 2022 with a level of profitability that allows continued investment. And I would leave it at there, because, as I said, I don't want to give any indication of future pricing by segment. Chris Growe : I understand. Thank you for the color you can give. And just a quick follow-on in relation to Brian's question earlier about the investment, I think you just said about how you're trying to be in a position to be able to reinvest again next year in 2022. I assume, you're going to reinvest every year, frankly, and I think that's hopefully going to help drive the strong revenue growth. I just want to get a little more color, as you\u2019re thinking about 2022. Is it a heavier rate of reinvestment you foresee? Or is it just the normal course of continued investment that you're calling out for next year? Dirk Van de Put : No. we are -- in general, what we're trying to do, of course, is a little bit up or down every year is to take half of the extra gross profit that we generate in dollars every year and reinvested in the business. That's the ideal format, let's say, that we're trying to achieve. And we're not planning to change that next year. As you can imagine, we will have to deal with the inflation that we see as Luca was explaining, so we will have to do more pricing, and we might have a little bit more pressure on our gross profit line. So, we -- for the remainder of the year, we are expecting that we will do better from a topline perspective, we will see significant growth in our gross profit line. But we are expecting that most of it, we will have to reinvest in the business. That's what we mean to get ourselves into the ideal position at the start of next year. But then next year, we're expecting to do exactly what I explained. Continue our current way of looking at things, and no expectation of increasing investment significantly next year. Now, on a year-over-year basis, that's usually a seven to eight, sometimes double-digit increase of our investment that formula I was talking about. Chris Growe : That makes sense. Thanks so much for your time today. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you, Chris. Operator : Your next question comes from the Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Michael Lavery : Good afternoon. Thank you. Dirk Van de Put : Hi. Luca Zaramella : Hi. Michael Lavery : Just wanted to follow up on innovation and SKU rationalizations and maybe try to tie them together a little bit. One, just could you give a sense of your progress on SKU rationalizations? I know the 25% you were cutting is big, but it clearly hasn't slowed the organic growth. Just then also curious a little bit related to that on innovation, if it's -- what your learnings are from that process. And if it changes how you think about screening or gating your launches and just what implications it might have as you look at new products. Dirk Van de Put : Yes. First of all, on SKU rationalization. There's really three levels of how you should think about SKU rationalization. First of all, there is stopping production. And so not reducing certain SKUs anymore. Second is then having those SKUs not in inventory anymore. And then third, having those SKUs not in the store anymore. So, those are the three levels. Where we are at the moment is that of that 25%, most of it, the production has been stopped. We're gradually running out of inventory. We didn't want to write off the inventory, which would give us a big cost effect. And then it's now starting to show up in-store. In-store, we're not yet down 25%, but it's increasing rapidly. The effect of that sort of trickle reduction is going to be that I don't think you will see an effect on our topline, and that is really should go by almost unnoticed that we have 25% less SKUs. Keep in mind also that, that 25% was kind of 2% or 3% of our total net revenue. And if we manage it well in-store and keep the same shelf space and replace those 25% with faster rotating SKUs, we could even gain sales. On innovation, in a business like ours, innovation is kind of three things. It's, first of all, what we call renovation, it's existing SKUs that we have to renovate, update, make more interesting. Second, there is then innovation within the core news flavors and so on. And then there's what we call innovation beyond the core, which is new to market type of segments or new types of products. What we have been aiming for in our innovation approach is that renovation part and that sort of new flavors part. That's where we believe we can reduce a little bit the amount of activity that we have, and we've been doing that also around the 25% mark. And that has led to bigger renovations or bigger sort of within the core innovations. And we're seeing the benefit from that. And it's clearly showing up in the way our net revenue growth is being composed. Where we still have work to do is, what we call beyond the core. We're working that hard. We're trying to shift some resources to that. That requires a longer lead time, requires more investment, but over time, can give a significant growth for the company. So, what I would say here also, the 25% reduction has given an upside to us. And we are very happy with the way our innovation contribution to growth is panning out at the moment. Michael Lavery : Really great color. Thank you so much. Luca Zaramella : Thank you. Operator : Okay. And your last question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Ken Zaslow : Hey good evening guys. Luca Zaramella : Hi Ken. Ken Zaslow : Just a couple of questions. One is, what have you seen with price elasticity to customers. And how is this different than in the past. Second question would be, when you think about your acquisitions, all your tack-on -- your bolt-on acquisitions, how much incremental sales growth do you think that's added? And how much will it add going forward? Dirk Van de Put : The first question, Luca, do you -- Luca Zaramella : Elasticity. So, if we see elasticity numbers that given prices raises -- Dirk Van de Put : Okay. Yes. Okay. Sorry, I can't -- I didn't understand the question the first time, it was a bit interrupted for me. But from an elasticity perspective, our categories are showing what I would say, an average elasticity from what I've seen to other food categories. And it depends a little bit where you are in which market around the world. In developed markets where most of the sales are through supermarkets and done in larger packs, there are price points, but they're probably not as solid. And for instance, in Germany, the price per kilo is extremely important, while in France, the exact price point where that pack normally is sold is much more important. And so, it's a mixed picture. But I would say, we can more easily move things up or down. And then again, when we talk about pricing, you should not just think about direct price increase. It's also what we call price pack architecture. It's the amount and the depth of promotions that we have and at some of the trade activities that we deploy. So pricing is a big word or is sort of a grouping of a number of activities, which might not necessarily immediately translate in a lasting effect for the consumer who suddenly sees the price change. In emerging markets, it's slightly different. There, it's really about price points and you need to maintain those price points. So in general, what we do there is we work much harder on productivities, reducing of packaging, improving the cost of our ingredients, improving the cost of our distribution and so on. Also making sure that we work hard on price pack architecture and so on. So that's a bit more of a difficult approach, where you need to stick to the price points. And usually, when you have to move away from a price point, the elasticity effect shows quite considerably in your volumes. And so, the game is played slightly different there. So I hope that explains a little bit the two ways that we manage elasticity. But I would say, in North America and Europe, in general, the way we're doing it, and as you probably heard in previous discussions, our price movements are bigger than previous year but not massive. And that's thanks to that RGM approach, I would say. We are able to deal with the elasticity that comes from it and an example is a 4%-plus volume growth we've seen in this quarter. As it relates to acquisitions, acquisitions that we've done so far have added about $1.5 billion to our top line. The idea is that they grow high single digits, and so you can probably calculate what they add to our top line growth. I would say, it's probably in the order of 0.3% growth. Our plan is to continue to do bolt-on acquisitions. It's difficult to say how much and when and at which growth rate. But, in general, when we announced our strategy, we always said that we were counting on a 3%-plus organic growth, and then we would complement that with growth through acquisition. In that thinking, we were thinking that about 0.5, 0.6 of growth would come eventually from acquisitions. So that's more or less what we have in mind. We haven't done that many acquisitions yet, and it will probably still take us a few years before we got a significant math that would lead to that 0.5, 0.6. But that's sort of our thinking as it relates to the contribution of acquisition. Ken Zaslow : Great. I appreciate it. I just had a quick one, just to add is, at what level of sales growth would you not reinvest that would fall to the bottom line? And I'm not guiding you anywhere, but if it was 5%, would you drop it down? Is it 6%? Is it 4.5%? And then, I'll leave it there, and I really appreciate your time. Luca Zaramella : So the idea is to -- the algorithm we have in mind is 3%-plus on the top line. It is under normal circumstances, 4% to 5% GP dollars. And then we take half of it, we reinvest it and half of it we drop it to EBIT. And then, that should deliver the EPS growth of high single digit. Clearly, as you look at this year, we are ahead on top and bottom line. But as we said very clearly, what we want to do is to sustain the market share gains and potentially additional pricing that is coming and enter 2022 with the level of confidence that we can still have this virtuous cycle we are in and that we want to protect. Ken Zaslow : Great. I appreciate it, guys. Thank you. Dirk Van de Put : Okay. Thank you. I think with that, we can conclude the call. We'd like to reiterate that it was a great quarter, solid top line growth, good gross margin and gross profit growth, significant reinvestment in the business and I think a strong bottom line. Going forward, we will see a bit more inflation pressure. And our intent is that we will deliver a higher topline growth, 4%-plus, as we said. And that any additional margin that we have that we would reinvest in the business so that we can enter to 2022 with a great share position as well as a great margin position, which would allow us to continue our virtuous circle in 2022. Thank you for the interest in the business. Looking forward to take you through the results of Q3 and Q4. And thank you, of course, for all your questions. And that's it. Thank you.

Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Mondelez management and the question-and-answer session.  I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President Investor Relations for Mondelez. Please go ahead, sir. Shep Dunlap : Good afternoon and thanks for joining us. With me today, are Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO, and Luca Zaramella, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements about the Company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements of risk factors contained in our 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.  As we discuss our results today, unless noted as reported, we'll be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures, which adjusts for certain items included in our GAAP result. In addition, we provide our year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. We're also presenting revenue growth on a two-year CAGR basis to provide better comparability, given the impact of COVID on 2020 results. You can find the comparable GAAP measures and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation. In today's call, Dirk will provide a business and strategy update, then Luca will take you through our financial results and outlook. We will close with Q&A. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dirk. Dirk Van De Put : Thanks, Jeff. And thanks to everyone for joining the call today. Q3 marked another quarter of high quality top-line growth for our business. These result was marked by a continuation of the solid volume growth that we are used to, as well as higher contribution from pricing as we successfully executed pricing actions in multiple markets in light of the inflationary environments. Demand for our categories remains very strong across both developed and emerging markets, and within those categories, our market share remains higher than pre COVID as a result of strength in execution, activation, and innovation. As you know, like the rest of the industry, we are currently operating in a very dynamic environment that poses multiple challenges. These include input cost inflation globally, as well as labor and truck shortages in markets like U.S. and the UK. We are taking the appropriate actions to navigate these, including further rounds of pricing and cost control. You will hear more on this in a moment from both myself and Luca later in the call. Despite the current operating environment, we remain focused on and confident in our long-term strategy of delivering accelerated growth through a virtuous, top-line driven cycle, which requires continuous investment in our brands and our capabilities. Let me turn to Slide 5 and the consumer.  During Q3, consumer confidence stabilized in general with a notable call-out of improved confidence in Western Europe, India, and much of Latin America as consumers are now more optimistic about job prospects and personal finances in those geographies. Mobility continues to rise, which provides a boost to gum and candy, as well as the travel retail channel, but both are expected to remain below pre-COVID levels at least through 2022. Ongoing uncertainty is fueling the desire for comfort and indulgence, which has been a consistent trend throughout COVID, and of course this is benefiting trusted brand like ours. All of this means that our core categories are growing faster than they were pre-COVID, and that our portfolio, which skews towards in-home consumption is benefiting. Demand is strong in developed markets, but especially so in emerging markets. Not withstanding a few smaller markets like Vietnam, which are suffering from continued COVID lockdowns. On top of all this, we have gained share during the COVID period. The elevated demand for our categories is contributing to price elasticity below historical levels. Consumers are willing to pay more for essentials or affordable treats as they spent less on eating and drinking outside the home. Let me spend a moment on the current operating environment on Slide 6.  Like other companies, we are experiencing cost inflation globally, particularly on transportation cost and packaging, which are most pronounced in U.S. Costs have moved higher in the second half of the year relative to the first half, and we expect inflation to persist in 2022. There is also an element of volatility in the supply chain due to labor shortages at third-parties, combined with a significant gap between demand and supply of trucking capacity and containers in places like U.S. and the UK. In addition, there are energy shortages in China as demand has outstripped the supply of electricity in many areas. And as you might be aware, we also had a strike at 3 of our plants and 3 distribution centers in the U.S. The strike is now resolved, but impacted our production output in the quarter.  The good news is that the new contracts give us flexibility and unlock additional capacity to support our growth ambition. COVID-19 continues to cause disruption in certain geographies. This was felt most acutely in Q3 in Southeast Asia and resulted in a temporary closure of our factory in Vietnam, for example. Although challenging, we are managing through all these dynamics. We believe we are well equipped to continue to deliver against our objectives, given the strength of our brands, our continued investments, pricing as necessary, and our focus on execution. Turning to slide 7, you can see that our strategy is continuing to drive a virtuous cycle.  And the results support our ability to consistently deliver profitable, volume driven growth, pricing as needed and return of capital to our shareholders. We grew revenue by 5.5% in the quarter and 5%, sorry, 5.1% year-to-date, a lapping 3.9% growth in the first 3 quarters of 2020. Gross profit growth was impacted by cost inflation and supply chain volatility in Q3, but continues to be well over 4% year-to-date, which we consider to be a very healthy indicator of our ability to deliver the high single-digit adjusted EPS growth that is part of our 2021 outlook and our long-term financial algorithm. Our year-to -- year-to-date working media investments have increased double-digit versus last year.  And combined with our advantage portfolio of brands and our execution and activation capabilities, mean that on a 2-year cumulative basis, we are gaining or holding share across 75% of our revenue year-to-date. And in terms of cash generation and capital return, we increased our year-to-date free cash flow by approximately $400 million versus last year. And we returned $3.1 billion of capital to shareholders. Adding the Q3 revenue growth to our track record of performance since launching our strategy in late 2018, you can see on slide 8 that we are now averaging a 4.1% quarterly growth rate.  And we believe we can consistently grow in line or in excess of our long-term algorithm of 3% plus based on the long runway of growth opportunities we show on Slide 9. And the advantage to enablers, we have to realize them. These enablers include, for instance, increased brand investment, higher quality and purpose-led marketing, and pricing when necessary. This quarter, we continued to make progress against our key growth drivers. These include continuing on our journey to grow Oreo by $1 billion by the end of 2023, with activations like Oreo Pokemon, which became our fastest selling addition of all-time in the U.S., surpassing the previous records set by Game of Thrones and Lady Gaga Oreos.  This also includes expanding our presence in key channels like digital commerce, which grew 25% this quarter on a reported basis, lapping 80% of growth in the previous year. And also emerging markets where we continue to gain distribution in places like China and India with another 120,000 and 80,000 stores added this quarters. And finally, this includes increasing our exposures to high growth segments, where we are underrepresented. For example, well being, where we announced breakthrough innovation this quarter on our largest brands with the Cadbury Plant Bar in the UK, which is suitable for vegans, and our Oreo Zero sugar in China, which has the clear potential to expand to other geographies.  Turning to Slide 10, let me update you on our sustainability journey. Climate change is a critical issue facing our planet and we must do our part to help. We also know that if we want to deliver consistent long-term growth and shareholder returns, we must be a sustainable snacking Company. For those reasons, we recently announced that we will take the necessary actions that we believe will allow us to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. This is a major target that applies to all greenhouse gas emissions across scopes 1, 2, and 3.  This target also sees us join the United Nation's race to 0 campaign, as well as the science-based targets initiative business ambition for 1.5 degrees where we are strengthening our position from our previous commitment of well below 2 degrees. We plan to deliver net 0 by focusing on the highest contributors to our carbon footprint. In our case, that our raw materials which contribute 71% of our emissions. We will amplify our existing programs like Tolko life and harmony wheat in Support of this. And we will focus on leveraging emerging low carbon technology at our owned operations.  Alongside working towards net-zero emissions, we will continue to advance all other pillars of our ESG agenda, including sustainable ingredient sourcing, diversity, equity, and inclusion, and net-zero packaging. We are excited to continue our journey to build a sustainable snacking Company. With our proven strategy, our preferred brands, our executional excellence, our compounding investments, and our enhanced ESG agenda, I'm confident that we are well-positioned to deliver strong performance for years to come. With that, I will hand over to Luca for more details on our financials. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Dirk, and good afternoon. Our third quarter performance was strong across the board. We delivered top-line trends, good operating profit dollar goal, including significant branding investment and excellent free cash flow. Revenue grew 5.5% underpinned by solid volume growth and pricing that we have been implementing to counter unprecedented cost inflation. Emerging markets continued with accelerated growth, displaying the resilience of our categories and strong execution. They grew more than 12% for the quarter, and nearly 9% on a 2-year basis. Our emerging markets results include double-digit growth in Brazil, Mexico, and India, as well as high single-digit growth in China, Russia, and Africa. These markets are attractive growth engines for us. As consumer purchasing power continues to grow, as we feel, white spaces, as we pursue distribution expansion and that's consumers trade up.  We continue to invest behind them in a big way. For the quarter developed markets growth remains solid at 2% with a 2 year average growth of 3%. Demand and consumption trends are robust in these markets. Albeit, supply chain restrictions limited our growth, specifically North America. Turning to Slide 13 and portfolio performance. Biscuits grew 2.7% and more than 5% on a two-year average. Brazil, Russia, and Mexico posted double-digit growth, while India and China grew mid-single-digits. Oreo continues to be a standout performer.  Chocolate grew more than 11% with a two year average of more than 8%. India, Brazil, and France grew double-digits. The UK grew high single-digits, and Russia grew mid-single-digits. Cadbury, Milka and Lacta all delivered robust volume-led growth for the quarter. Gum and candy posted double-digit growth, resulting from a continued improvement in mobility. Moving to market share performance on slide 14. We continue to see good share performance. On a 2 year community basis we have held or gained share in 75% of the business. These skits and chocolate heads or gain in 80% of our revenue base.  Notable share gainers on a 2-year basis include the U.S., China, Russia, and Brazil B scaled, and U.K., Australia, Russia, and South Africa Chocolate. Gum and candy has shown gaining in 30% of our revenue base, primarily due to gum performance in China, Russia, and France. Although still below pre-COVID level, this category continues to improve with mobility trends. Moving to page 15, Gross profit dollars grew 2% for the quarter, reflecting the acute impact of elevated inflation in commodities, as well as transportation and labor costs in North America. While all other regions still face some inflation, they all display GP dollars growth in line with our expectations.  In the short-term, we have adopted our promo and trade deal spending to the elevated cost environment. But as we expect these dynamics to persist into 2022, we have also taken and announced price increases across a significant number of markets. Of note, we announced a new round of pricing last month in the U.S., which will go into effect at the start of next year. Although cost pressures are not as high as in the U.S. we also have a robust pricing agenda for other markets too. We have implemented pricing in Brazil, Mexico, Russia, and Southeast Asia, in addition to other business units. Our goal remains to enter 2022 with improved dollar profitability levels from these actions to support the virtuous cycle which funds continues investment.  Operating income dollars increased 4.5% due to strong overhead management and simplification initiatives. We continue to invest in A&C, which was up almost double-digit in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, gross margin has increased nearly 5% while operating income dollars that's grown by more than 8%. A&C has increased double-digits. Moving to regional results on Slide 16. Europe revenue grew 4.6% in the quarter and 4% on a two-year basis, while dollars grew 5 -- 4.5% versus last year, reflecting a strong virtual cycle. North America grew 0.3% on top of 6.3% growth last year, resulting in a 2-year average growth of 3.3%. Operating income declined 9.7% in the quarter. Overall, North America results were negatively impacted by service level constraints in the U.S. as transportations and labor shortages have impacted both cost and .  These constraints are primarily impacting our external manufacturing and third-party logistics partners. We expect profit dollar growth to improve in conjunction with recently announced price increases across much of our U.S. portfolio that go into effect as of January 1st next year. For the quarter, the impact of the six-week U.S. strike was mitigated by a business continuity plan, which included increasing inventory levels ahead of it. Nevertheless, there will be an impact in Q4, which I will discuss in our outlook. AMEA posted growth of 5.72% and a 2-year average of 4.9% with broad-based strength apart from Southeast Asia where COVID -related restrictions did impact our Q3. India delivered double-digit growth in the quarter and China delivered high single-digit growth.  AMEA operating income dollars grew nearly 8% while continuing to make sizable working media and route to market investments. Latin America grew 26% in Q3 and 14% on a 2-year average. Brazil and Mexico both grew double-digits while dollars in Latin America grew double-digits over prior year due to pricing and volume growth. Now, turning to EPS on Slide 17. Q3 EPS increased 9.4% at constant currency, driven primarily by operating gains, with year-to-date EPS increase of nearly 9%. Moving to cash flow and capital return on Slide 18. We delivered free cash flow of $700 million in the third quarter, bringing us to $2.1 billion on a year-to-date basis.  We also repurchased approximately $1.8 billion in shares in the first three quarters at attractive prices. I wanted to spend a quick moment on some of the significant improvements in our best facture financing costs and pension costs on Slide 19. Since 2014, interest expense has been reduced by approximately 60% despite an increase in total borrowings with a current average rate of 1.7%. At the same time, we have extended our maturity from 7.7 years to 9.6 years. Similarly pension funding has improved significantly in the recent years to 99% driving material reductions in pension contribution requirements and costs.  And in September, we issued our first , which was the largest to-date in the GPG sector, enabling us to cost effectively fund our sustainability initiatives around focal packaging and now our net 0 carbon target. Let me spend a moment on slide 21 regarding the current  and supply chain environment and our actions. The supply chain environment remains a challenge for us, like many others with higher cost inflation, as well as labor shortages at the 3rd-parties and train transportation capacity. We have a well-established  to mitigate the impact of inflation rate and supply chain pressures over time.  These include successful implementation of price increases as part of our RGM strategy, supported by the strength of our brand. We're also continuing in our journey of portfolio simplification to identify additional SKU reduction opportunities and to improve service levels and overall efficiency. In terms of our manufacturing network, we are taking actions to free up capacity with more flexibility in some of our plants and logistics networks. We also continue to execute our hedging programs of key commodities, which we believe have been effective, as you can tell by looking at our realized and unrealized mark-to-market gains this year.  Overall, we are confident that these initiatives will allow us to offset the majority of the pressures we are currently seeing and will drive long-term profit dollar growth, albeit with some lumpiness given the cadence of pricing and input cost increase. Moving to our outlook on Slide 22. We expect most of the trends that we have experienced in Q3 to extend into Q4, including robust demand for our categories and brands in both developed and emerging markets, continued transportation and labor inflation and supply chain pressure in our North American region, increased focus on Revenue Growth Management activities across a wider span of businesses, high level of investment in our people, friends, markets and capabilities.  Based on our strong results year-to-date, continued categories resilience, and solid demand trends, we are raising our full-year revenue growth outlook to approximately 4.5%. This implies Q4 growth of 3% or nearly 4.5% on a two-year taker and assumes approximately a 1 point of top-line headwind from the impact of the continued transportation and logistic constraints and the recent strikes in the U.S. As the market conditions remain fluid, this outlook does not reflect a material worsening from current environment. In terms of EPS, we continue to expect high single-digit growth for the full year despite the initial pressure from commodities and transportation and labor dynamics in North America.  We also expect free cash flow generation of $3 billion plus. Forex translation is now expected to positively impact our reported revenue by 2% points, and EPS by $0.09 from the year based on current market rates. One note related to our simplified to grow restructuring plan. We have extended the program by 1 year as we're still left with about $100 million of available funds that we plan to spend on high return supply chain and overheads related projects. The overall amount of the restructuring program is unchanged.  So this does not change anything else in our outlook for this next year. Our updated outlook is based on current conditions and does not factor on material degradation in the operating environment that would be triggered by a significant worsening of COVID or supply chain restrictions. To wrap up, we are encouraged by the trajectory of demand for our brands and categories across our geographies. We are confident in our growth strategy and our ability to continue to execute against it going forward. This means balance and consistent top and bottom line growth, continued reinvestment in our business, disciplined cost management, and strong free cash flow generation. With that, let's open it up for Q&A. Operator :  We'll take a question from Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Your line is open. Andrew Lazar : Great, thanks very much. 2 for me. First, Dirk, if you could talk a little bit more about key trends you're seeing in both emerging and developed markets, and really the key consumer dynamics there, and then Luca maybe if you could give us a bit more rationale behind the implied deceleration in 4Q organic sales growth and then touch on preliminary expectations for 2022, the top and bottom line. Thanks so much. Dirk Van De Put : Thank you, Andrew. I'll start and then I can hand it over to Luca. Well, if I look first at emerging markets, they continue to be a major growth engine for us. In Q3, they grew double-digit. Year-to-date, they're growing double-digit, they're high single-digit on a 2-year CAGR, so very strong volume growth, good pricing. And linking that to the consumer, I think what we're seeing is that the consumer confidence is improving in markets like India, big parts of Latin America, they are seeing the vaccine roll out, they're seeing life going back to normal. They feel better about their personal finances and that is reflected in their consumption. At the same time, they still spent more time at home, which benefits our categories.  Particularly the bric k countries are very strong with a very strong double-digit growth in India and Brazil, and high single-digit growth in China and Russia. The execution there in those 4 countries as we've entered this quarter. But at the same time looking at Africa, Poland, Pakistan, Mexico, they're all growing well. The only places in the emerging markets where we see some disruption is in some smaller markets, particularly Southeast Asia, where the COVID cases were quiet severe and there was serious restrictions. We talked about our plant in Vietnam being closed for 3 weeks, and so that has had an effect on Q3 but hopefully that will be temporary.  From developed markets, what I would say, demand is strong but it's a challenging operating environment, particularly in the U.S. So we had big consumption spikes in 2020, particularly in the U.S. But so far we are up 2% in revenue in Q3 and just over 1% year-to-date lapping a very strong last year. But if you look at a two-year CAGR, it's over 3%. That is well above where we were in 2019, where we were growing about 2% in developed markets. And we see the consumer behavior where the consumer on average is spending 15% more time at home than before the pandemic; that is clearly benefiting our categories and our portfolio. Looking particularly or specifically at North America, it's growing well on a two-year CAGR -- almost 4%, but declining slightly year-to-date versus last year. But again, 2020 was a extremely strong year for North America. The demand remains very robust in biscuits, but the servil -- service challenges in the second half, due to pressures on the logistic capacity, third-party labor and the strike, which is now resolved, had an impact in Q3 and will continue to have an impact in Q4. Europe, we're seeing a very solid quarter, very solid year-to-date, the demand for our core categories is robust. We've got a very strong year-to-date revenue growth for the UK, for Germany, the Nordics. and mass retail, which is lapping strong growth last year is still very good. And then of course we're benefiting from the recovery in convenience and travel retail as the consumer is regaining mobility. Maybe the other thing that I would say that we are in an inflationary environment. We've been increasing prices and we plan to increase the prices more than we've done, at least in the time that I'm here and probably for quite a while as a Company. For what is good is that the elasticity levels are below historic levels and almost nothing to speak of. So that is helping the overall performance. Maybe over to you, Luca. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Dirk and hi Andrew. I'll start with revenue guidance. And as far as revenue goals, I would simply say the business is fundamentally in a good place. You might have seen in the pages that we presented that Chocolate and Biscuit categories are vibrant. On a two-year stock, our share gains are very good. And you might also have noticed that pricing contribution is increasing as you would expect given the cost pressures we are facing. But also that volume is holding up quite well. We can also say that virtually all international businesses are positioned very well for both Q4 and 2022. However, in North America, obviously the 6-week strike predominantly, but also the volatility that Dirk mentioned, is putting some pressure on our supply chain, and that will impact the Q4 performance, in a context where the market is steadily positive and demand is quite good. So we estimate that mostly because of the strike impact in Q4, that there will be a 1 point of revenue pressure for the whole of Mondelez. So to sum it up, Q4 is still going to be a good quarter, I believe in terms of revenue when considering that there is the one-time strike impact. And at this point, we feel quite good about top line and its momentum into 2022. From a profitability standpoint, we also feel good about the full-year profit outlook. In the end I think you know, that year-to-date GP dollar is up by 5%, EBIT by 8% and all in a context where we are increasing A&C double-digits with over at flat. And I feel comfortable with our EPS high-single-digit guidance for 2021.  Having said that, I have to recognize that there is some GP pressure in Q3 and that will persist into Q4 and partly into 2022. The pressure is due to commodity transportation costs and compounded, quite frankly, by some industry-wide supply chain constraints. North America is driving most of the pressure in the GP line in the quarter, and it is, in fact, the only region that declined GP dollars versus last year with the other regions all above or close to our goal of 4% GP growth year-on-year. We are taking the appropriate actions to counter those cost spikes. We have recently announced a 6% to 7% price list increase in the U.S, which will take effect in 2022, January.  We have also announced pricing in Q4 in Brazil, Mexico, Russia, Southeast Asia, Africa, and across Western Europe. We are leveraging RGM as we said many times, also going after productivity and general cost measures. So we expect sequential improvement versus previous years in the following quarters as more pricing kicks in. So at this point, we believe that our 2022 EBITDA growth will be solid through volume mix pricing, obviously productivity, and we're still contemplating meaningful A&C increases at this point. So 2022 from an EBITDA standpoint should be on algorithm based on what we know today.  because obviously Q1 will be a little bit more pressure and we will provide more clear and comprehensive guidance in the next earnings cycle for 2022. Andrew Lazar : Thank you. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Andrew. Operator : Our next question is from Nick Modi of RBC Capital Markets. Filippo Falorni : Hey, good afternoon, guys. This is Filippo Falorni on for Nick. Luca Zaramella : Hi Filippo. Filippo Falorni : Hi, I just want to go back to your long-term guidance on organic sales growth of 3% plus, you've shown a slide that since the implementation of your new strategy, you've clearly delivered a 4% organic range pretty consistently and on average, for several quarters now, and you just raised guidance for this year. So I was just wondering in your confidence of delivering a 4% consistently going forward and potentially raising your long-term organic sales growth outlook going forward? Luca Zaramella : Yes. Maybe I'll start and obviously the  here. Looking the end, we see the long-term algorithm as a baseline. Our categories -- if you look at historical levels, they have been growing at 3 plus percent, and that clearly is a good place to start from. We plan to gain share. So we should be always above the 3% mark and that's really what drives this baseline. In the end, we are more focused on actuals than long-term algorithms. And by executing well, obviously, we aim at being closer to a number that is with 4 than with 3.  And so that's really the rationale behind the long-term algorithm. If there are some catalyst, namely some portfolio changes and more acquisitions, I think that will be the good opportunity for us to revisit the algorithm and declare formally that we aim at something higher than 3% plus. But I think you're right, in the end, the track record we have speaks for itself. We have been steadily delivering higher growth and we plan to do so also going forward. Filippo Falorni : Got it. Thank you very much, that's helpful. And then a quick follow-up. Your market share performance has been very strong in recent quarters and over the last couple of years, some of your global brands like Oreo have done extremely well. Can you just talk a bit about your local brands and how they've been doing recently and over the last year or so? Dirk Van De Put : Yes. So historically, our global brands have been growing faster than local jewels, but we have been accelerating the growth of our local jewels and largely through renovations and activations. 2020 was different. There our local jewels grew faster than our global brands because a number of our global brands were impact ed by COVID -related changes in consumer behavior. So Toblerone, for instance, because of travel retail decline, Hall's because it was very limited cough and cold season. And then Trident because the gum category was impacted by reduced mobility. If you then look at 2021 -- year-to-date 2021, global brands are now growing faster again than local . But both are growing very strongly. Both are in the mid single-digit group. And w'are very happy with where our local brands are at this moment, from flat to declining a few years ago, they're now, as I said, mid-single-digit. We continued to step up brand investments year-over-year and we're going to continue to activate more local jewels over time. So we think we've found the ideal balance, and we continue to continue -- to keep on going as we are. Filippo Falorni : Great. Thanks, guys. I'll pass it on. Dirk Van De Put : Okay. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Your line is open. And Mr. Goldman, you may want to check your mute switch, your line is open. We'll move next to the site of Brian Spillane. Your line is open. Of Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : Hi, thank you, Operator. Good afternoon, everyone. Luca Zaramella : Hi, Brian. Bryan Spillane : So just two quick ones for me. 1. Just a follow-up on the commentary for 4Q, Luca. Just kind of listening to some of the puts and takes on the gross profit line. Are gross margins in the fourth quarter going to be somewhat similar to what we saw in 3Q or do you expect a further deterioration? Luca Zaramella : Versus last year, they should be a little bit better. We should have a little bit less pressure. Remember, we are in some emerging markets specifically implementing additional pricing, which went into effect in July, August. And so it should be sequentially better when compared to last year. Bryan Spillane : Year-over-year, but what about just sequentially? I think it was 38.3% in the third quarter. So is fourth quarter going to be in that neighborhood? Luca Zaramella : Yes, it would be around that neighborhood a little bit lower, most likely on a pure number. Bryan Spillane : Okay. And then Dirk, just your perspective on the incremental rounds of pricing that you're taking to offset inflation. And I guess how it'll be different this time. I think if we go back prior to your coming to Mondelez, one of the issues was that there was quite a bit of pricing taken over time to protect or build margins. And it definitely had an impact on volume on demand, it's a big part of what you came in to --to address and change and time you've been at Mondelez so maybe you could just kind of talk about how you've thought about that dynamic this time around and how it will be different, maybe the way your approaching pricing or just what's different about the ability to have some pricing power this time versus the last time Mondelez really tried to lean into pricing to protect or build margin? Dirk Van De Put : Yes. I mean, as a principal, what we're trying to do is the mixture between volume growth, pricing, and mix, needs to offset the inflation, that's how we think about it. And then on top of that, we have a whole productivity program, which we use to increase our margins. It's different from the past in the sense that we are not as aggressive on pricing, we're not trying to build extra margin because of pricing, we're trying through the mixture of those three things, maintain it as it is. And then the extra comes from the productivity programs. The other big difference versus the past is that we continue to increase year-over-year our investment in our brands.  First of all, our overall A&C pot, but then also how much we are shifting within A&C into working media. So the worst you can do, I think is increase prices and not increase your support for your brands. So we've been supporting our brands now every year more and more. Our media pressure has significantly increased versus 3, 4 years ago. We can see that the brand health is increasing. So I think our brands are now more susceptible to pricing and the consumer should accept it better. Those are the two big differences, Bryan, versus what it was a few years ago. Bryan Spillane : All right. Thanks. Thanks, Dirk. Thanks, Luca. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Bryan. Operator : We'll take our next question from Chris Growe of Stifel. Chris Growe : Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you. Luca Zaramella : Hi, Chris. Dirk Van De Put : Hi, Chris. Chris Growe : Hi. I just had a question. First, as we think about a planning assumption for next year as you have some strong pricing going into place, especially in the U.S., do you model as such that the elasticities remain very favorable or do you expect elasticities to be more like their historical average, and then, if you -- it's better than that, that represents upside to your outlook, because that -- I'm just curious how you think about that with what you're seeing with the consumer today? Dirk Van De Put : Yes. At the moment, what we are modeling is the historical elasticity. We have to take into account also that -- and we know that the current elasticity we're seeing is better. so that would potentially be an upside for us. We also are using what we call RGM, Revenue Growth Management, which is a mixture of different techniques if I can call it like that, and it's not always a straightforward price increase. If I look at the consumer, I think the main thing that's at work here, is that consumer confidence is stabilizing, mobility is on the rise. They have an ongoing desire for comfort, so they want to snack and they're spending more time at home.  All that gives a very strong demand for our categories. Our categories are growing more like 4% around the world versus a 3% that we usually plan for. And so the -- I think that is leading to consumers to almost have no elasticity at the moment. And we hope, or we think that that will remain quite a while. And so I think we don't want to do that in our planning for next year, but we do believe that there might be better elasticity than what we planning for at the moment. Chris Growe : Okay.And I have one other question in relation to North America, just understand if you had any more detail on and if you gave this forgive me if I missed it, but around costs around the strike. I know you talked about maybe some hit to revenue in the fourth quarter, and then I would contend that you shipped a little below consumption this quarter. Just to understand the effect on the business that we saw this quarter in Q3 from the strike overall, and that's all I had. Thank you. Luca Zaramella : Yes. Maybe -- Dirk Van De Put : Yep. Luca Zaramella : May -- Dirk Van De Put : Go ahead. Okay. Luca Zaramella : Maybe I'll take that. So on the strike from a top-line standpoint, as we said in Q3, the impact is fairly new. There was virtually no impact as we enter the quarter with actively high trade stock, given the elevated consumption, we have depleted that stop. And so there is an impact in Q4, but we quantify together with some other supply chain related issues at one point of revenue for Q4. From a cost standpoint, we have mitigated the cost impact, obviously all the puts and takes are slightly negative, but they are not meaningful on the top P&L profile for Q4. Clearly, some demand pressure -- some supply pressure will put a little bit of a cost strain on the value chain, and we will have a little bit of under-absorption kicking - in in the P&L in Q4, but that's as far as it goes, no material I would say, overall at this point. Chris Growe : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Alexia Howard of Bernstein. Alexia Howard : Good evening, everyone. Luca Zaramella : Hi Alexia. Dirk Van De Put : Hi Alexia. Alexia Howard : Hi there. So I have 2 questions. The first one is on pricing. It sounded as though you're getting the pricing in North America in early January and yet you've been able to take pricing in a number of other regions earlier than that. I'm just wondering if there's something structural or procedural in North America that makes it harder, or lengthier, longer to take pricing here and just what -- if you have observations on that. And then my follow-up question is really around the net zero commitments.  I remember a few months ago, I think that was a lesser than to make that commitment that some of the other companies I have made. Did something changed? Did you get better visibility into how you might achieve that goal or is it more about things are changing out in the world after and therefore, you've got to make that commitment and see where it takes you.Thank you. Luca Zaramella : Dirk Van De Put : You think pricing out taking at 0 Luca? Luca Zaramella : Yes, let's partner here, Dirk. So I -- the simple answer is we had a lot being particularly on promotional activities. Also giving obviously some internal dynamics to our Company which we discussed. We had luck being at promotional windows and promotional activities well before Q2 and that bound us with our customers to certain promo windows and certain promo activities. And we thought that rather than disrupting even further the supply chain, our preference was really to go for a full 100% price increase as of January 1st.  So there might be a couple of quarters of -- at these location. But I think, all-in-all considering all the effects that we had internal and external, it was better for us to go in effect with pricing as of Q1 next year. Obviously, we will be extremely nimble here. We still don't know to what extent logistics costs will spike during the Christmas season and the holiday season in the U.S. So if we see continuous cost pressure, at this point, we cannot rule out additional pricing waves, and at that point, it will be more simultaneous to what we see than it has been this last time. Dirk Van De Put : Okay. On this zero, the --the thinking was that we wanted to make sure that we have worked as much detail as we potentially could. And so we were a little bit represent in the past few years to declare anything until the team has done their homework. And so they've been working quite hard, we've gone quite deep. I'm being told that it's probably one of the deepest exercises in trying to understand how do you really get there. And so we were really wondering. Hey, will we get there? Can we make a plan that began realistically believe in that it's doable. And then we wanted to know the different details step-by-step, but it means. So if I summarize it a little bit, it's obviously a very significant announcement for us.  It's really an acceleration and an extension of our existing initiative. Applies to all our greenhouse grasses and the full supply chain, so scope 1, 2, and 3. And with this, we are joining the UN race to 0 and the SVTI business ambition for 1.5 degree Celsius. If you look at our footprint, 71% of our footprint is coming from ingredients. And so the 3 big areas to work on is those ingredients, it's our own operations and it's our logistics. And if you think about it, in ingredients, that means that we need to continue and increase our investment in cocoa life. That's one of the big factors.  We have a wheat program related to regenerative agriculture. We need to extend that. We need to make sure that our whole packaging approach is clear on recyclable, but also working on the recyclability and the use of virgin plastic over the years. We needed to get into our operations, understand renewable electricity. We need to reduce food waste which we've done quite significantly, but we need to do more. 50% in our own operations, 50% in our distribution, for instance. We need to change all our ovens.  We need to change all our boilers, and so on and so on. And then in logistics, we need to switch to electric vehicles, hydrogen trucks, work on our warehouse emissions, and change the efficiency of our networks. Just to name a few things of what this means. So the team has worked through all these details and they've come up with a plan that is credible. It's not easy. We've also made a 10-year plan for the Company, Vision 2030, which, during 2022, we're planning and Investor Day around that.  And all the costs of net-zero have been built into that plan, which is another thing that we wanted to make sure of that we had the cost clear. So that's why you felt in the past month we were a little bit hesitant because we were working through this exercise and I really didn't know is this all add up and if this is the plan that we really believe in. But I think we've come up with something strong that the Company feels that we can deliver. It's not going to be easy, but that's why we can make the announcements right now. Alexia Howard : Thank you very much for all the color.I'll pass it on. Dirk Van De Put : Okay. Luca Zaramella : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey, good afternoon, folks. Thanks to spot me in and congrats on a good result. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Jason. Dirk Van De Put : All right, Jason. Jason English : A couple of questions for me. First, the 6 to 7% price increase in the U.S. that weighted average? Is that what we should actually expect to see flowing? Or is it on partial portfolio, dampening effects? Anything we should be considering as we look to put pen to paper on our models. Luca Zaramella : It is an overall net average price increase in the U.S. portfolio. So we have announced that for Biscuit, and on average that's the number, we are going with gum and candy as well. Hall's will be a little bit later in the cycle. But all in all it is going to be very close to the 6%, 7%. Jason English : Got it. Okay. And then sticking in North America, quickly, simplify the growth charges that are being backed out there -- they're pretty substantial, I think roughly $330 million year-to-date. So really chunky numbers. Could you elaborate on what is all this expense that we're backing? And what is the expected return on all this investment? Luca Zaramella : We announced earlier in the year the closure of the plants. And with all the activities we have been having around the reset of some of the U.S. network, that's really the biggest part of the cost in restructuring. So that's, that's really what it is at this point. Jason English : And the anticipated return or savings that you expect to be generated from that? Luca Zaramella : Obviously, we have an internal rate of return expectation that is well in excess of cost of capita. You might imagine that particularly as it relates to the 2 plans, we're going to avoid fixed cost as we go into next year. And so the return is going to be on the high side. On top of that, the strike resolution did gets us additional flexibility. It was a win-win for us and our employees to whom we gave good benefits I believe. But together with the avoidance of fixed cost, the additional flexibility, this program itself is going to yield good returns. Jason English : Excellent. Great stuff. Pass it on. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Palmer of Evercore ISI. David Palmer : Thank you. Good afternoon. Wondering if you could talk about the Third Quarter gross margin declined. Your pricing was 3%. How much you think was the impact of input inflation versus other factors like the supply chain inefficiencies in the U.S. and UK? And I have a quick follow-up. Luca Zaramella : Yes. As I said,in the end when I look at really GP growth across the board for our regions, I feel quite good about what was accomplished across the European business, the EMEA business, and the Latin America business. The pressure can release from North America and it is, quite frankly, mostly attributable to the logistics and transportation cost constraints that we have seen. We also had to acknowledge though, that particularly around some commodities like edible oils, etc. There has been some pressure. So I would say that the GP line pressure comes in Q4 mostly because of the commodity and logistics cost. And it is mostly attributable to the North America business.  And so a s you think going forward, pricing should really improve margins because I believe the cost severity in Q3 is quite high in my goal a little bit further in Q4 and into next year. But it can not fiscally, proportionately the same amount as we have seen in Q2 and Q3, in Q4, and into 2022. So that's a little bit of color around the GP line. David Palmer : And just a quick follow up to Jason's question about price increases in the U.S., it sounds like those alone -- are those announced price increases might add upwards of a point to your global price number heading into the first half of '22. Is that right? And then I'm just curious for the entirety of '21 for common world travel retail, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you wouldn't get back to 2019 levels, perhaps even into the end of '22, but that doesn't mean you can't get some of that back in '22. So how far below in '21 were those businesses versus '19? Thanks. Luca Zaramella : Yeah. Maybe I'll go with the first part and answer the gum and candy questions. I think you know how big North America is in total for the Company and you have a sense of what a 6%, 7% price increase would do. So I think your math is in the ballpark. Obviously the question is, how is volume going to react? And what we're seeing at the moment it is that elasticities are more benign than they have been historically, but we need to see protracted price increases into next year, and we need to see what moving away from some price anchors will do to our consumers. And that's a little bit the question mark at this point. As I said though, for the totality of the Company at this time, I see good revenue momentum going into '22, and I see revenue being on algorithm for next year as well. Dirk Van De Put : So on on gum and candy can be maybe first on gum. I think it was coming in world travel retail. But on gum roughly, I would say gum drops to about 65% to 70% last year, of what it is in 2019 because of mobility. I think for the total of '21, it's going to be roughly around 85, maybe 90% of where it was in 2019. And then we expect that it will close that gap in 2022. Now, in the beginning of the year, the recuperation was slower. Recently, we have seen an acceleration of the recuperation of gum. So we're talking about double-digit revenue year-to-date, growth of gum, and strong double-digit revenue growth in Q3. So year-to-date on a 2-year CAGR, were still negative high-single-digit, but as I said, the recovery is going faster. And then we starting to see some markets, particularly China and Russia, where we now have a positive 2-year CAGR on gum. The emerging markets remain attractive for us and the question is really on the developed markets, which is only 2% of our 2020 net revenue. And so that's -- that's really where we expected recovery to be slowest. As it relates to world travel retail, that dropped almost to 0, I would say, It was probably at 5% of what it was before the pandemic. This year, we will probably get back to depending a little bit what happens at the end of the year we traveled, but maybe 65% 70% and then depending on what consumers decide to do as it relates to travel, that's the big unknown. We will for sure go up significantly next year, but I'm not quite sure that we will see the same amount of travel. And as a consequence, buying on travel as we saw in 2019. So that's still a little bit up in the the air. But we will get close to I think gum will be all the way back. But remember, gum wasn't growing a lot in 2019, so back but no significant growth and world travel retail close, but not completely we think. David Palmer : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our final question from Pamela Kaufman of Morgan Stanley. Pamela Kaufman : Hi, good evening. Luca Zaramella : Hi. Dirk Van De Put : Hi, Pamela. Pamela Kaufman : How are you thinking about the level of investment needed to support the strong top-line momentum that you've seen? And do you expect to increase brand investment further to support higher pricing? And if so, can you talk about which categories and geographies there might be greater investment behind? Dirk Van De Put : Yes. I can talk a little bit about the principles and then maybe look or you can go into more detail if, if needed. But in general, we believe that we want out grow our categories, and to outgrow our categories, our brands need to have more visibility, more support, more innovation than others. We believe that i can be achieved with roughly, I would say a 7% to 8% increase year-over-year of our A&C investment. And that's fits into our long-term algorithm, where our expectation is that 1/2 of the growth of 4%+ growth that we want in gross profit year-after-year, that 1/2 of that gets reinvested.  Not all of that goes into A&C, some goes into overheads, part goes into R&D. But overall that's the thinking, and that allows for that roughly 7% to 8% increase, so it's 15 through the long-term algorithm. As it relates to pricing and increasing our investments, we trying to maintain our algorithm. If we see we can get a better top-line, we might do more flowing -- continuously flowing at 50% back into investment. This year, as an example, we have a double-digit increase in our A&C year-to-date, while we are doing the price increases that Luca talked about. Then, the other movement that we're doing is within the A&C investments, we are moving more of the investment in working media.  We have done that now for multiple years. So the investments are really compounding. There is the increase in overall A&C and then the increase in working media within A&C. And then we have also made big strides on the quality, the effectiveness, and the ROI of our marketing. If you talk about where do you want to do more, we have our Local Jewels, which we have given significantly more investment in the last three years. But we want to continue to do that more on the brands that we're already supporting and activate more brands.  And then as it relates to markets where we would do that, probably the -- some of the markets where we are underrepresented, largely emerging markets, that's where we think we should do the biggest increases of our A&C because we still have to the category to support and really build the category for the longer term. That's how I was thinking about it. I'm not sure, Luca, if you want to add something? Luca Zaramella : No, I think it has been a consistent theme, the one that we have been implementing in the Company in terms of A&C investment. If I look back, I think since 2019, even despite fine tuning the A&C line. in 2020, given obviously COVID, we have been able to increase A&C, I think versus 2018 by 25% f you look between again, 2018 and where we are today. Particularly on the working media, we have been improving quite a bit the situation about what we spend in that P&L line.  And I would also say the quality of advertising and the mix of advertising it has been got improving the ROI quite a bit. And so I think that's one of the things that has made the mobile more sustainable for us. And I think when you look at volume growth, share gains, there is a strong linkage with these investments we have been making in global and local brands. Pamela Kaufman : Thank you. Can you just give an update on the white space opportunities that you're targeting and how you're leveraging the recent acquisitions to to address these opportunities. Dirk Van De Put : Sorry. Yes, the wide space opportunities for us are -- I mean, if you look at our building blocks for growth, the first 2 are pretty straightforward. It make sure our categories keep on growing. We are big players in our category, our category growth depends pulsely of us. Second, continue to increase our market share and that gives us a bigger growth. Third, there is the channel expansion that we can do. We are not having the same market share in all channels. Thinking about, for instance, online or digital commerce in the more developed markets. But we're also talking about numerical distribution in emerging markets. As I was saying in the prepared remarks, we are increasing China by 120,000 stores and India by 80,000 stores our presence this quarter alone.  So then on top of that, there's high growth segments within our categories, and so I'm thinking about well-being, thinking about premium, and those are some of the areas that we are underrepresented and that we should be really launching new products in there and using some of the acquisitions that we've been seeing to getting there, for instance, out grenade or  would fit in this category. Then we have geographic wide spaces around the world, countries where we are not yet that present.  And so we haven't done that many yet, although an acquisition like Chipita, which largely plays in East and Central Europe and some of the other emerging markets. Obviously, we'll reinforce our presence, but they're largely in the same countries as we are or where we already have a smaller presence but it certainly will give us more critical mass. And then the last one is the closing adjacencies, which are the bakery and the bar segment.  And so Chipita fits or Give & Go fully fall into that sort of growth opportunity that we have. And so that's the last wide space. So it's between channel, high-growth segments, geographical wide spaces, and closing adjacencies. Those are the 4 big wide spaces that we have. Pamela Kaufman : Thank you. Operator : And this does conclude our -- Dirk Van De Put : I think we've come to the end. Yeah? Operator : Sorry. Go ahead. This does conclude our Q&A session. I'd like to return the call to you for any concluding remarks. Dirk Van De Put : No. I think we've come clearly through the end. Thank you for your interest in the Company. Happy to reply to more questions. Please contact the Shep and Andrei and we will do whatever we can to help you out. And looking forward to talk to you at the end of the year to give you a full update of where we've ended 21 and give you our guidance for 22. Operator : Thank you. Luca Zaramella : Thank you. Operator : This does conclude today's Mondelez Corporation Q3, 2021 earnings call. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a good day.",

Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by the Mondelez management and the question-and-answer session. . I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondelez. Please go ahead, sir. Shep Dunlap : Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO; and Luca Zaramella, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website.  During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K, Q and 8-K filings for more details on our forward-looking statements.  As we discuss our results today, unless noted as reported, we'll be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures, which adjust for certain items included in our GAAP results. In addition, we provide our year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. We're also presenting revenue growth on a 2-year CAGR basis to provide better comparability given the impact of COVID on 2020 results. You can find the comparable GAAP measures and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation.  In today's call, Dirk will provide a business and strategy update, then Luca will take you through our financial results and outlook. We will close with Q&A.  Before turning it over to Dirk, I would like to remind you of 2 upcoming investor events. First, we will present virtually on February 22 at CAGNY, focusing on our AMEA region; and second, please save the date for a Mondelez Investor Day on May 10.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Dirk. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you, Shep, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. I am starting off at Slide 4. 2021 marked another year of strong top and bottom line results. Growth was driven equally by volume and pricing as we leverage the strength of our brands and execution capabilities. We continued to deliver on our long-term growth algorithm, returning nearly $4 billion in capital to shareholders while investing in our growth initiatives, positioning us well to deliver strong performance in 2022 and beyond.  The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact both consumer behavior and the broader operating environment. Against this backdrop, over the past 2 years, consumers continue to choose our trusted and beloved brands for both comfort and sustenance at home and on the go. We have delivered on this strong underlying demand across our brands and geographies with continued strength in execution, activation and innovation. As a result, our cumulative market share remains higher than pre-COVID levels.  At the same time, we are continuing to operate in a dynamic environment characterized by global input cost inflation alongside supply chain, labor and transportation disruption. We are effectively mitigating these challenges through ongoing cost discipline and strategic pricing actions. We also continue to execute well against our strategic growth priorities, investing in our brands, capabilities and sustainability initiatives while expanding our portfolio with the addition of several growth accretive acquisitions, Hu, Grenade, Gourmet Food and Chipita, which closed earlier this month. These additions increased our exposure to broader snacking categories and growing profit pools. Along with our financial performance, we made progress in other areas. We continue to advance our ESG goals, setting ambitious new targets for achieving net zero by 2050, and we continue to accelerate our DEI agenda. And none of this would be possible without our people, the best in the CPG industry. We're proud of the way our teams continue to focus on delivering great products to our consumers as pandemic conditions continue to impact both our work lives and our personal lives. I am especially grateful to our frontline teams whose hard work and dedication delights families all over the world. We are confident that the strength of our brands, our proven strategy and our continued investments position us well to achieve our long-term financial targets in 2022 and beyond.  Let's take a closer look at the market and macro trends on Slide 5. With the recent rise of the Omicron variant, the rebound in mobility that we saw earlier in 2021 has slowed down in both developed and emerging markets and is expected to remain 10% to 15% below pre-COVID levels in many markets. Time at home and eating at home look likely to remain elevated. In the U.S., for example, 60% of adults are not expecting to eat out more in 2022 than they did in 2021. This positions our core biscuits and chocolate portfolios well as they are skewed towards in-home consumption.  The pandemic continues to fuel the desire for comfort and indulgence, benefiting our categories and trusted brands. And overall, as we found in our state of snacking survey released last week, the tendency for daily snacking is up for a third consecutive year. And although 70% of global consumers report concerns about inflation, it has done little to date to change their grocery shopping behavior. This is consistent with the observed price elasticity, which has been much lower than historical levels as well as a continued share weakness for private label. Let me spend a moment on the current operating environment on Slide 6. Like other companies, we are experiencing cost inflation globally, particularly on transportation costs, dairy, edible oils and packaging. We have implemented material price increases, ensures we are significantly hedged across key commodities and we are continuing to drive productivity measures. We also continue to manage through significant volatility in the supply chain due to labor shortages at third-parties as well as a continuing gap between demand and supply of trucking capacity in containers in places like U.S. and the U.K. In addition, the U.S. strike in Q3, although resolved, impacted our production output and inventory levels in the quarter. Additionally, COVID-19 continues to cause disruption in consumer mobility in certain geographies, impacting our gum business and on-the-go products. This currently affects a small portion of emerging markets. Additionally, the rise of the Omicron variant is driving high levels of absenteeism in certain markets while limiting recovery mobility. We are focused on reactivating part of our COVID playbook from the early pandemic days and also looking to further simplify our operations to offset this pressure. And although challenging, we are managing effectively through each of these dynamics.  We implement our revenue growth management levers and continue to invest in our brands while taking extensive measures to lighten the supply chain disruption. By applying the lessons learned from earlier waves of the pandemic and maintaining our focus on execution, we are confident that we remain well positioned to deliver our growth targets.  Turning to Slide 7, you can see that our strategy is continuing to drive a virtuous cycle. Strong volume momentum, combined with brand investments and strategic pricing options, position us well to consistently deliver profitable top and bottom line growth as well as strong return of capital to our shareholders. We grew revenue by 5.2% in 2021, lapping 3.7% growth in 2020. Volume was once again a big contributor to this growth, which demonstrates the fundamental strength and health of our business.  Despite the ongoing impact of cost inflation and supply chain volatility, we delivered gross profit growth of 3.6%. Our working media investments have increased double digit versus last year on the back of a double-digit increase in 2020. Combined with our advantaged portfolio of brands and our execution activation capabilities, we gained or held share across 75% of our revenue on a 2-year cumulative basis. We increased operating income by 5.8% and delivered $3.2 billion in free cash flow. We view these results as a healthy indicator of our ability to continue to deliver on our long-term growth algorithm.  As you can see on Slide 8, we are now averaging a 4.2% quarterly growth rate since the launch of our strategy in September 2018. We're proud of our strong and consistent track record over this time. As we continue to focus on profit dollar growth, local first commercial execution, high return investments and aligned incentives, we are confident that we can continue to consistently deliver attractive growth.  On Slide 9, you can see some highlights of our successful execution against our long-term growth drivers. These include delivering our strongest Christmas sales on record in Europe, growing double digit versus 2020 and 2019, led by Cadbury in U.K. and Milka in Germany. It also includes continuing to expand distribution in emerging markets, adding 300,000 stores in China and more than 200,000 stores in India. It includes investing to sustain growth in digital commerce, which grew 29% on a reported basis, lapping 75% growth in 2020.  Digital commerce now accounts for approximately 6% of revenue, up from 3% in 2019. And it also includes expanding our presence in high-growth segments where we are underrepresented, including well-being where we launched breakthrough innovations on key brands like Oreo Zero Sugar in China as well as Cadbury Plant Bar and plant-based Philadelphia in the U.K. As consumer demand for well-being options rises, each of these innovations has a clear potential to expand to additional geographies.  We also grew our presence in the premium biscuit space with double-digit growth led by Tate's, which we successfully transitioned to direct store delivery. Additionally, we expanded our presence in close-in adjacencies, such as baked snacks with the successful integration of Give & Go. By realizing revenue and cost synergies, we grew that business double digit in 2021. We also expanded our presence in snack bars with the acquisition of Grenade in the U.K.  Switching to Slide 10. We continue to further enhance and strengthen our portfolio in 2021, expanding our exposure to the growing profit pools in chocolate and biscuits as well as adjacent categories and the well-being and premium segments. We acquired 4 high-growth strategic assets : Chipita baked snacks in Europe, which just closed in January; Grenade well-being snack bars in the U.K.; Gourmet Food premium crackers in Australia; and Hu premium well-being snacks in the U.S. These acquisitions are worth $800 million in annual revenue, and they are well positioned to collectively deliver high single-digit growth for years to come. This takes our total number of acquisitions to 7 since 2018 and contributing over $1.5 billion of revenue.  We also earned $1.5 billion in net proceeds from selling down on our beverage assets in 2021, enabling further investment in our brands and growth drivers. Additionally, we are in the process of completing a strategic review of our developed market gum business. We expect to complete that review and have more information to share with you at our May 10 Investor Day.  2021 was a strong year, and we are well positioned for another year of strong shareholder returns in 2022 and beyond. By staying close to our consumers, executing our proven strategy and taking the appropriate actions to navigate input cost inflation and supply chain volatility, I am confident that we can deliver strong performance for years to come.  With that, I will hand over to Luca for more details on our financials. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Dirk, and good afternoon. Our full year and fourth quarter performance was strong in terms of revenue growth, volume, earnings and free cash flow. We delivered revenue growth for the year and quarter of 5.2% and 5.4%, respectively. Importantly, half of this performance was underpinned by volume.  Emerging markets increased 12% for the year and 11% for the quarter with strong performance across significant majority of countries, especially the BRICS. Despite a small group of countries, specifically in Southeast Asia continuing to face COVID-related challenges, overall, we are encouraged about the outlook for our EMs in the near and long term. Developed markets grew 1.6% for the year, coming off an exceptional 2020 and 2.5% for the quarter off a strong comparison. As with our emerging markets, we are encouraged by the sustained performance, particularly in our key core snacks categories.  On Slide 13, you can see our portfolio performance. Chocolate and biscuits remain attractive and durable categories with very strong results both pre-pandemic, during the pandemic and, importantly, as we enter 2022. In addition, improved mobility has yielded growth in Gum & Candy versus 2020, approaching a return to pre-pandemic levels in many markets and back to growth versus 2019 in China. Biscuits grew 3% for the year and 3.2% for the quarter. EMs were the big driver of performance, with majority of our AMEA and LA business delivering double-digit or high single-digit growth. This underscores the large long-term opportunity for our EM biscuit businesses as we continue to make investments in A&C portfolio growth and distribution expansion. Both global and local jewels brand, including Oreo, Chips Ahoy!, Barni and Club Social delivered strong growth. Chocolate grew more than 10% for the year and 8% for the quarter, with significant growth across both developed and emerging markets through both our global and local brands. Chocolate is a great category to be and, as in biscuits, we continue to make investments in our brands and capabilities to continue to drive its performance for the years to come. Gum & Candy posted 7% growth for the year and more than 11% growth for the quarter as increased mobility resulted in a return to growth in several key markets, especially within Latin America.  Now let's review our market share performance on Slide 14. We continue to see good share performance on a 2-year cumulative basis as we prioritize A&C investments and execute well in most markets. We held or gained share in approximately 75% of our revenue base on a 2-year stack. Our biscuits and chocolate categories continue to do well, with 80% of our revenue base holding or gaining share. Overall, share gains versus 2019 were broad-based, with all regions growing share over a 2-year period.  A few of the more notable areas of share gains over this time include China, Russia, India, Brazil and Mexico biscuit; U.K., Russia and Australian chocolate; and China gum. As we move into Q1, we expect softer share performance driven by our North American segment as the combination of supply chain constraints from third-parties and labor shortages will pressure stocks and service levels.  While the immediate effect of the strike is behind us, we have entered 2022 with low stocks, and we are working to rebuild inventory levels, which takes time in this environment, particularly as demand continues to be strong. We expect a gradual improvement of the situation as the year progresses.  Now turning to Page 15. For the year, we delivered strong OI dollar growth of almost 6% driven by solid gross profit dollar increases and reduced overheads. For the quarter, profitability was pressured primarily due to the lag between commodities and ForEx-related inflation and implementation of pricing actions, specifically in North America where price increases became effective at the beginning of January.  Turning to regional performance on Slide 16. Europe grew 5% for the year and 6.5% for the quarter supported by strong execution and activation and continued recovery in the convenience away from home and travel retail channels. Our Q4 results were driven by some growth across major markets, including the U.K., Germany and Russia, underpinned by solid share gains. In chocolate, we delivered record results for the Christmas season, growing double digit against both 2020 and 2019. Biscuits and meals categories also delivered good results, while dollar growth for the year was high single digits driven by continued volume leverage, cost control and strong overhead management. Looking ahead in this region, we expect muted profitability in Q1, with improvement beginning in the second quarter as price increases in a number of countries take effect. North America declined by 0.6% for the year and 0.3% for Q4, lapping very strong high single-digit growth in the previous year. This performance includes healthy growth from our ventures portfolio. Softening in the quarter and second half were also driven by supply chain constraints and low inventory levels due to the strike and third-party labor constraints. North America OI declined minus 10.4% for the year and minus 20% for the quarter due to inflationary pressure and supply chain constraints. As mentioned earlier, we expect sequential improvement as pricing actions go into effect in Q1. AMEA grew 7.3% for the year and 5.8% for the quarter, showing continued strength across most of the region. India grew double digits for the year and continues to execute well as we invest for the future. We continue to extend our leadership position in chocolate, while the growth of our biscuit business continues to outpace larger competitors in the region. China grew low double digit for the year and high single digits for the quarter driven by continued share gains in both biscuits and gum. Australia and New Zealand also did well with solid performances in the year and in the quarter in chocolate and biscuits. AMEA increased OI dollars by more than 13% for the year due to strong volume leverage, productivity and overhead management while also increasing Working Media by double digits. Q4 growth was more muted due to commodity inflation. As in other regions, pricing actions to RGM are being implemented as of Q1.  Latin America turned in strong growth for the year of 20.4% and 19.7% for the quarter with overall share gains for 2021. Brazil delivered strong double-digit growth for the year and quarter. Mexico grew high single digits for both the year and the quarter and our Western Andean business grew high single digits for the year and mid-teens for the quarter. Adjusted OI dollars in Latin America increased high double digits for the year and more than 40% for the quarter. These increases were driven by broad-based growth across core snacking categories, effective pricing and the volume and mix impact of higher Gum & Candy. Inflationary pressure remains challenging, but we believe both RGM and volume growth will enable us to largely offset this dynamic in 2022.  Moving to EPS. Full year EPS grew 9% at constant currency. This growth was primarily driven by top line-driven operating gains.  Turning to free cash flow and capital return on Slide 18. We delivered full year free cash flow of $3.2 billion, which included $300 million higher tax payments year-over-year, some related to our coffee JVs, IPOs and sell-downs. We continue to feel confident about our free cash flow trajectory as we move forward. And for the year, we returned $3.9 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.  Now let me provide some color on our 2022 outlook on Slide 20. We expect to deliver against our long-term growth algorithm that we see as a performance floor, particularly as revenue grows. As you are hearing across all sectors, we anticipate another year of material cost inflation which, in percentage terms, is expected to increase high single digits versus 2021. As such, pricing will be a larger top line contributor than in the previous years, but we do expect volume growth to also be a positive factor. In this regard, a few more points. Our superior portfolio of brands and the consistent investments we have made and will continue to make in Working Media, marketing and sales, route-to-market and RGM capabilities position us well for sustained growth and profitability in this higher inflation environment. We believe we can continue being an effective driver of category value and volume growth, specifically in biscuits and chocolate. Our focus is not changing as we aim at growing profit dollars and dollar growth underpins our sustainable algorithm, cash flow and capital return. We had a history of cost excellence, which we expect to remain the case for 2022 and going forward. Our algorithm continues to be predicated on brand building and capabilities in sales and marketing also in 2022.  All included, for the year, we expect mid-single-digit to high dollar growth and high single-digit EPS growth. Earnings phasing will reflect the current inflationary environment and the sequential introduction of pricing. We expect improved year-over-year gross profit dollar growth as pricing is fully realized and as we implement additional RGM strategies. But we do still expect some pressure in Q1 and partially in Q2. For Q1 specifically, we still expect to face larger supply chain headwinds in North America related to third-party partners and low inventory from last year's strike that should improve as the year progresses. With respect to free cash flow, we expect another year of $3 billion plus. In this outlook, we also expect an ETR in the low to mid-20s based on what we know today, interest expense of approximately $325 million and share repurchases of approximately $2 billion.  With that, let's open the line for questions. Operator : . And we will take our first question from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Kenneth Goldman : There's been some discussion lately in the media about emerging markets potentially slowing down a bit as 2022 progresses. I think no one really knows for sure what will happen. But I'm just curious, it seems like things are fine for you now. But as you look ahead to your major regions or major countries, is there anything that you are particularly worried about, anything that you look at and say, \"Oh, this could get a little worse as we go?\" Or is it just sort of, \"Hey, we're planning on steady as she goes?\" And I'm just curious what's baked into your guidance potentially for a little bit of not demand destruction but a little bit of a worse sort of consumer around the world, perhaps? Dirk Van de Put : Yes. Well, thanks, Ken. First of all, I would say that around the world, but also in emerging markets, today and for the last 3 years, our core categories have been doing quite well. Chocolate and biscuits have been growing very strongly and, in fact, better than they were before the pandemic. There's a number of factors at work with the consumers that are boosting the consumption and higher snacking. So we see very robust demand. And if I go to our key emerging markets, the BRIC countries, we see that in those 4 countries also very, very clearly.  As it relates to investments and support for our brands, we are also continuing to do that in emerging markets. If anything, that's where we increased the most. And I think that from a pricing perspective, we have been dealing with pricing in emerging markets over the years, and we know that we have to hit certain price points, and we're very careful with that. Having said that, we have already started to increase prices. In fact, the effects that you see in Q4, any price effects there, are largely coming from our emerging markets. We've increased prices in most emerging markets around the world. And as you can see, results have been very good. So we also have that very low elasticity that we are also seeing in the rest of the world. So everything is sort of aiming in the right direction. We feel that at this stage, there is no signs that it's slowing down in emerging markets. Obviously, in our projections of our algorithm, we have not taken the same height of performance that we've seen this year in our emerging markets. We've taken that a little bit more conservatively.  So based on those two, seeing what we're seeing and the experience that we have and, I believe, us doing all the right things as it relates to pricing, investments, gaining distribution, which is another big driver in emerging markets for us, and the fact that we feel that we have been relatively realistic in what we forecast for emerging markets, we feel pretty good. We think that emerging markets will deliver for us in 2022. Kenneth Goldman : Great. That's clear. And then a quick follow-up, if I can. Luca, you touched on this a bit. But is it reasonable, just given your comments about the phasing of pricing and maybe the timing of inflation too, to think about the flow of your years maybe being a little bit more back-half loaded and perhaps a little bit more challenged in the front half? And if that's true, are there any specific timing issues we should consider other than pricing and inflation just as we model ahead? Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Ken. It is mostly pricing and inflation phasing that will drive the gross profit, specifically as a line in the P&L progression throughout the year. Obviously, you saw the number being pressured in Q4. But as you look closely on the segment profitability data that we disclosed, you see that the Q4 GP pressure came mostly from North America where we have just announced pricing. And so you will see a sequential progression that is positive in the gross profit line as of Q1, but the most of the benefit to hit our guidance is going to come in the second part of the year.  And as I said, there are 2 elements there. One is pricing implementation, and there might be multiple pricing waves. The second one is the fact that, particularly in Europe, pricing will come into effect as of Q2 and in other places as well. And third, it is the fact that inflation, given the favorable commodity pipeline that we had in 2021 in Q1, commodity pressure is most acute in the first half of the year. But you will see a better trend in GP dollar as of Q1 and sequentially, it will improve over the quarters. Operator : We'll take our next question from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : Luca, maybe just following up on Ken's questioning, just a couple of sort of bridging from '21 to '22 questions, if you will. If we look, first, have we quantified or can you quantify just how much the acquisitions contribute to earnings growth in '22 versus '21, adjusted EPS growth? Luca Zaramella : Look, the Chipita acquisition is a material acquisition, obviously, in terms of size but also the number of countries it spans across. And it will be fully integrated, but it will take a little bit of time. I will say that, without giving you specific numbers, there is a moderate positive impact on EPS next year, but you will see the full benefit of the revenue and cost synergies as of Q4 and, potentially and obviously, in 2023. So it will be a modest contribution all in all considered. Bryan Spillane : Okay. And just more of a contribution in '23 versus '22. Luca Zaramella : Absolutely. I think you're going to see the full benefit, and I think you will be pleased in 2023. Bryan Spillane : Okay. And then if we look at below the operating profit line, in 2021, in the bridge that you laid out in Slide 17, including share repurchases, the below the operating profit line items contributed about $0.09 of earnings in '21. And I guess just looking at the guidance, it just seems like interest expense, the tax rate could both be a bit of a headwind. So can you just sort of give us -- should we expect that there would be some earnings contribution below the operating profit line? And if so, I guess, would it be mainly share repurchases? Just trying to square how much benefit we get below the operating profit line. Luca Zaramella : Interest costs will be up around about $20 million, $25 million. So it is $0.01 of EPS headwind. Tax rates will be a little bit higher, but not much, and so I would say a slight headwind. Obviously, I can't comment very much on the joint ventures as those are publicly traded vehicle. But the biggest benefit is going to be most likely around share repurchases. In terms of the JVs, I will refer back to what was said about KDP profit guidance for 2022. And I think that's the stance we have taken for that. Operator : We'll take our next question from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Perhaps Luca, could you just comment first on what your outlook or expectation would be in terms of gross margin change year-over-year for the full year? And I guess, to the extent you see some full year gross margin compression, more would need then to come from SG&A leverage to get to your sort of mid-single-digit constant currency EBIT target. So in that case, what would be those SG&A drivers that you would have to lean more heavily on this year potentially, given what your answer on the gross margin is? Luca Zaramella : Sure. I think you know that we try to move away from gross margin percentages. And I think that has served us well. So talking about gross profit dollars, 2022 is no exception to what we have said consistently throughout the years. We aim at getting at 4-plus percent on that specific line of the P&L. And as I said, I think you're going to see year-over-year GP dollar growth as of Q1 but will be most pronounced in the second part of the year.  I think, again, as you dissect the numbers, you clearly see that the pressure in Q4 on the GP line, which was slightly positive, comes mostly from North America. And what you have to believe for the GP line to improve, as the biggest change that has to happen, it is pricing going into effect in North America. The first indication is that, a, price was accepted by the retailers; and b, we see our prices going up in the marketplace. So I feel cautiously positive about that, which is clearly the biggest driver of GP progression over the quarters.  In terms of SG&A, we will continue investing in advertising. Obviously, we will be very sensible because there are situations, specifically in North America, where we don't have enough stock. And so we are calibrating exactly where we want to spend. But as Dirk said, in emerging markets, we will continue pushing and we will continue pushing in the other regions too. The point here is the last thing we want to do as we implement pricing is cutting back on A&C investment.  As far as overheads and productivities, we will continue the great job that we have done over the last few years and particularly in the last couple of years. Excluding the acquisitions, our overlying pure cost SG&A is down both in 2020 and in 2021, and my goal is to keep that line down year-over-year. Productivity obviously is going to be good for the year as we look at it, but I'll be commenting more as we publish Q1 about all these specific lines. Andrew Lazar : And then Mondelez is guiding to positive volume growth for the full year despite some supply chain challenges and limited shipments in Q1 maybe in the U.S. and Europe and, obviously, the higher pricing. So I guess what sort of elasticity relationship is Mondelez underwriting for the year? Luca Zaramella : Look, we have been a little bit conservative on elasticity. As Dirk said, elasticity is low at this point in time based on what we see across the board, but we are planning for historical levels. So that's the type of elasticity we have planned. And I think you know the number in general, it is onetime elasticity, give or take, but I expect to do better than that. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow : I guess one of the surprises in the results is that North America shipments were weak. And all of us look at Nielsen retail data, and it looks really, really strong. So what's happening at retail? Is that just strong consumer takeaway and the inventories are getting depleted? Should we expect that retail consumption to then weaken in the first quarter as a result of running out of inventory? Maybe help us bridge why it looks so good from a consumption data? And then I had a quick follow-up. Dirk Van de Put : Yes. Demand remains very robust. But the growth that you see is -- or of our growth that you see is impacted by supply chain constraints and phasing of some of the price actions. And so in between those is our inventory, of course. And if you look at North America, we grew or we were flat for the year, let's say. But for a 2-year CAGR, we're at 4%, which is still quite strong. If you look at the last quarters, we had the strike in Q3, which left us with low inventory levels. And although improving, it's going slower than you would normally expect because of all the supply chain disruption that everybody is experiencing. And so we think that we will still continue to see on shelf effects from the strike throughout Q1. We also work more with external manufacturing than our colleagues. And those external manufacturers are facing labor challenges. And we expect also that we will continue to see some pressures in that area, at least for Q1.  And then the biggest difference probably is that we announced price increases for January 1, so they were not yet reflected in Q4, but you will start to see that as we report Q1. And we continue to work on our broader RGM capabilities. So as you look at Nielsen, you start to see at the moment the effect of those price increases, that's why our Nielsen starts to look better. But if you look at the Nielsen that we saw from last year, that's where you could see the effect of our supply issues. So as we look at Q1, we expect the top line in North America to improve. The margins will also improve, but it's going to be sequentially. As I said, pricing has been executed across U.S., Canada and our ventures. We are continuing to simplify our portfolio, and we are also taking actions to increase capacity, work, more temporary labor and so on, so that we sort of ease the pressure on our supply chain. We are continuing to invest in our brands. As Luca said, we will be careful to invest in those brands where we have good supply. But with the price increases, we are determined that we will have to continue to support our brands. And as you will see as these initiatives take effect in '22, the top and the bottom line growth will start to come back for North America. Maybe a last remark, the bottom line will be sequential because, if you look at it year-over-year, Q1 was a very good year last year. So you will still see some year-over-year pressure. And we have that lower inventory issue that I was referring to. But overall, you will see a very good improvement over the coming quarters. Robert Moskow : Okay. Well, my follow-up, you've been providing us with market share trends on a 2-year basis. But are you going to continue that in 2022? Because I think people will start to judge you more on a year-over-year basis. How will you represent your market share trends? Dirk Van de Put : Yes. No, we are going to go back to year-over-year. We thought it was useful with the pandemic because there was a number of effects, last year and also this year, exceptional effects that influenced the market share. And so we thought it was better to keep on comparing market share compared to pre-pandemic. Now that the pandemic is not behind us but improving, we feel that we can go back to normal market share. For instance, if you look at 2021, you have the U.S. strike in there, which affects, of course, our market share. But I think it's important to look at how the U.S. has been performing versus what it was before the pandemic and then excluding the strike. In Canada, this year, we were out of a listing with one of the most important customers there for quite a while, which also, of course, affected our market share. But we are back into that client, so the market share is going to come back. And then we had also exceptional effects in the U.K. chocolate last year where one of our competitors had a major supply chain effect, which then benefited us this year that supply chain is back up and running. So as a consequence, we'll give back some of that market share. And then we had one of our plants in France, which was affected last year, and we were not able to supply the market, so that had an effect for us too.  So there's all these -- and last year, I'm not going into the details about our competitors, but last year, we had big wins because our supply chain performed better than our competitors, I would say. So the main thing for us was to show the accumulated over the 2 years. And over the 2 years, we see a very solid increase versus what it was before the pandemic. And going forward, we will start to compare year-over-year, unless there is exceptional effects, which we can then inform you about. Operator : We'll take our next question from Chris Growe with Stifel. Christopher Growe : I just had a question for you. First, I think, a question for Luca. In relation to your hedging, there was a comment that you're about 70% hedged for the year. I do want to get a sense if that would be considered normal or above or below where you normally would be at this time of the year. And then just to understand, because you're quite hedged in 2021 as well, the degree to which some of these unhedged costs, freight or packaging, things that you can't hedge, are those like a lingering risk to 2022? Or do you have a better read on those costs for the coming year? Luca Zaramella : Thank you for the question. It's a very good one. 70% is pretty much in line with what we had in last year. It is higher than what it has been historically. And over time, what we have done is we have moved the needle up in terms of going longer because, obviously, that gives us the opportunity at the low levels to buy more. And so we have the opportunity to sit back and wait until the situation evolves. And mostly, of these hedges, are 2 options, and they are not straightforward covered. So we still have flexibility, should one of these commodities go over. And I think that's a great advantage. So I don't feel particularly worried about the remaining 30% at this point. But there are parts where there might still be pressure. What we see these days is a little bit more pressure coming out of dairy. And potentially, we will have to consider additional pricing for that in some places where we sell dairy-based products. And we also see some pressure in packaging and some ingredients. Now the assumption we have, at this point in time for the second part of the year, is inflation for those that is in line to what we have seen and what we are seeing these days. There could be potentially more. I don't expect a material number at this point in time, but we got a little bit surprised on these unhedgeable commodities and exposures in the second part of last year. So we are very vigilant. And if in case they go up, we will have to price and we will do so. Christopher Growe : Okay. Just one other question in relation to what have been some really strong market share trends, and that's the culmination of a lot of work and marketing and new products and your categories doing so well also. I guess I'm just curious, as you think about your pricing strategy for the coming years, it's but one example, just the degree to which you think there's maybe a little risk to your market share. Are you taking pricing that largely reflects what your competitors are doing and inflation in that market and, therefore, there shouldn't be a whole lot of movement in share? Just trying to get a sense given how strong it's been, if that could be a bit of a watch point. Dirk Van de Put : Yes. Well, our pricing is largely driven by what we think is acceptable to the consumer. We don't know what our competitors are planning until they do it. And so we try to price in line with what we think our consumers are prepared to pay for our brands. And that is different between emerging markets and developed markets. So in developed markets where you're largely talking about supermarkets and there's a whole bunch of pricing effects, you have a little bit more liberty. In emerging markets, we need to hit certain price points. So we do a lot of work on RGM price pack architecture and so on. So we expect that we will be very sensible. We're working very hard on RGM and better understanding what is possible for pricing for our brands, what is acceptable to the consumer. As you know, many years ago, we've had a few episodes where we probably went a little bit overboard on pricing. So we will step a little bit more careful as it relates to pricing. As I was explaining, in Q4, we've been pricing in emerging markets. And so far, that is working really well for us. And so it seems to be that our methodology is working. We'll see what happens in the U.S. and in Europe. But at this stage, it feels pretty solid, and we don't expect that there will be any major issues. Going forward, second half and into '23, we will see what the inflationary pressure is going to be, but I can assure you that we will step very carefully and make sure that we continue to see volume growth for our brands. Operator : We'll take our next question from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. David Palmer : Great. A question on pricing, we can see some clear pricing that you're taking in developed markets here into '22. With the positive volume guidance, I don't want to get too carried away about the incremental pricing, are you thinking that there might be some moderation in pricing from emerging markets in '22 versus '21? Or should that be very similar? Luca Zaramella : Very similar is the straight answer, David. There are pockets where we don't see the level of inflation that we have for the totality of the company. But in general terms, particularly around ForEx, there are places where there is a little bit more inflation. And so given all the puts and takes, pricing-wise, you're going to see a level of pricing in emerging markets that is in the same ballpark of 2021, a little bit higher. As a reminder, we implemented, I believe, 2 price waves in places like Russia in 2021. We implemented, I believe, 3 price waves in Brazil. And I can go on and on and talk about Mexico, Southeast Asia, Manaf in South Africa, where we have implemented multiple rounds in 2021 as well. David Palmer : Great. And just thinking about your contribution to growth in '22 versus '21, you mentioned how, in the last couple of years, perhaps you've gotten some points of distribution gains, particularly in developed markets from smaller brands that may not have had access or might have had more issues with supply chain, even though you gave some of that back in '21. I wonder if you suspect you'll have some tough comparisons in developed markets against smaller brands this year. But then I think about the ability for you to have new product news this year and then the acquired businesses that you've had, they could possibly get into greater distribution. So I'm trying to think about how you're thinking about the puts and takes of what seems to be some headwinds and some tailwinds going into this year. Dirk Van de Put : Yes. So I would say, first of all, on the smaller brands, that effect is certainly continuing in Q4, and they continue to do well. To the extent that if we have some supply issues, it is sometimes in those smaller brands, because they keep on selling at the higher levels we had during the pandemic, that sometimes give us some capacity pressure. So we are trying to do whatever we can to deal with those capacity issues, of course. But we are, at the moment, assuming that gradually they will give back a little bit, but we do still think that those brands will keep some of that momentum that we started to see during the pandemic.  And you are right, our global brands have performed really well this year. This was a year where our global brands outgrew our local brands. Last year, in '20, it was the local brands who outgrew the global brands. The reason is because Oreo, Milka and Cadbury, our top 3 brands, continued to be high single digit to double digit. And then you have the recovery of a brand like Toblerone, which is largely sold in world travel retail; or Trident, the gum, which is, of course, sold on the go. And they were heavily disrupted in 2020. The local brands, as I was saying, still are doing quite well. They are in the mid-single-digit growth range. And we don't necessarily see that slowing down going into next year.  And then there is the additional effect from the acquisitions. Of course, Chipita, you will not see that in our top line until the acquisition is done for 12 months. So you won't see an effect from that one. But you will see a good year for Give & Go this coming year. We are expecting. And also a brand like Perfect Snacks, which is a snack bar, which is also largely consumed on the go, that was affected by the pandemic, we're also expecting that to see a good growth. Tate's, we have moved on to DSD, saw very solid, very strong high double-digit growth there this year, which we think will continue into next year. So yes, there is an additional effect. Also important to mention is that the price increase has covered all the brands in the U.S., the global brands, the local brands and the venture brands. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : A couple of questions. It looks from everything we see like inflation, well, particularly owners in the U.S., is maybe kind of close to peaking. But it sounds like it's still building in markets like Europe and elsewhere. Can you walk us around the world real quick and tell us what you're seeing in terms of cadence, the level of pace, magnitude of inflation? Luca Zaramella : Yes. Sure. I'll take a stab at it. I will start by saying that the inflation is really the highest in the U.S. And look, it might be at the highest point in the U.S. right now, I don't necessarily see it going down in the second part of the year. So I want to make that point first. In terms of inflation, look, majority of the commodities we procure, they are global commodities. And so the inflationary pressure is pretty much the same around the world. Logistics costs is on the rise everywhere around the world, not to the level that we see in the U.S. And then there are packaging-related costs and ingredients that are pretty much consistent across the world. In terms of inflation, where it is mostly acute these days, it is in places where we have seen currencies weakening versus the dollar. It is in places like Russia. It is in places like Brazil. But overall, if you look around the world, in terms of inflationary pressure, I would say there are, yes, somewhere some peaks. But overall, it is fairly even, I would say. There are certain commodities that are more impacted than others. Cocoa, for instance, is a little bit more benign in 2022 than it has been in 2021. And so places where we have a material chocolate business, like in Europe, are going to see, in terms of inflation, a little bit less. But I just mentioned Dairy in one of the previous questions, and there might be further pressures coming up. So hopefully, I gave you a little bit of color on how we see costs evolving by region and by countries a bit. Jason English : Yes. No, that's super helpful. And just to come back to North America, obviously, it's unfortunate the persistent problems you're seeing in North America. I guess my question is -- they seem to be surprising you. If we look at the Nielsen data, kind of back to Rob Moskow's question, demand is there. And it looks like you're actually inducing demand because the promotional levels remain elevated. They're growing year-on-year. So it looks like you got a sales force, on one side of your organization, pushing demand and you've got a supply chain on the other side saying, \"Wait, we can't fill demand,\" and there seems to be this disconnect between the 2 organizations. So 2 questions. One, is it fair? And two, what's wrong to cause that disconnect, if so? Dirk Van de Put : I would say that, for sure, in the beginning of the inflation or the supply chain disruption, which we started to see in August, September of '21, there was clearly a disconnect because our sales teams saw high demand and the supply chain suddenly started to realize that transportation was difficult and that there was a number of other issues that were going on, a little bit of capacity and so on, labor shortages in our third-parties. And so yes, it took us probably a few months before we realized we need to reset here. Since then, the teams have been working quite closely, trying to link up whatever demand generation that we have with the supply capacity that we have. And so I'm expecting that in the coming months, we see that starting to work a lot better for us. So I would say it's fair, but we've gotten under that now, and we've solved the problem. And so going forward, we should be okay. Not sure if there was a second part to the question. That was it, I believe? Jason English : Well, yes, no, that's good. We've covered it all. We're connecting again later. So I'll follow up later, too. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Robert Dickerson : Great. Just have one question, just with respect to the top line, kind of circling back to all the commentary so far through Q&A. I know previously, it sounds like you were looking for, let's call it, maybe 6% to 7% pricing this year. That's implemented early part of January, North America. And then to David Palmer's question, it sounds like pricing in most EMs would kind of remain at a similar level relative to 2021 while, at the same time, there should be some improved pricing, it sounds like, coming through in Europe. So if I square all that, is it fair to say that maybe pricing for the year would -- it sounds like it's at least 3%. Maybe it could be a little bit higher. Because I'm obviously just trying to get to some gauge as to what's a rational, kind of organic growth forecast for the year, just kind of outside of just your traditional 3%-plus kind of long-term guidance. That's all. Luca Zaramella : Thank you for the question. We are usually not giving the breakdown of pricing and volume, and we try to move away to keep some sort of flexibility. But what I would tell you is that, as I said in the prepared remarks, I see the 3%-plus has a plus in it as a floor. And at this point in time, we really want to see how Q1 plays out with some price increases and Omicron before we commit to a higher number. But hopefully, we see Q1 coming in, in line with our internal expectations, and we will be in a position to raise the guidance on top line potentially after we see Q1 and we have Q1 under the belt. Hopefully, that's answering some of your questions. Robert Dickerson : Yes, fair enough. I guess I'll try another one. Just in terms of the cash balance, you're kind of ending '21 with a decent amount of cash. Leverage looks to be now a bit sub-3x, and it sounds like gum business is still under a strategic review. So kind of outside of the $2 billion potential in share repo, how are you thinking about just kind of general capital allocation in terms of M&A? Like, do you feel as if, as you get through '21, it's about stabilizing and tucking in Chipita and working on distribution opportunities with acquisitions already done? Or are you still pushing forward in terms of health and wellness premium, et cetera? That's all. Luca Zaramella : Look, the cash position at the end and the net debt position at the end of 2021 is obviously fairly good because we have done quite a bit of work all around. And I'm very happy with leverage being at 2.7x. Having said that, in January, we have just got a $2 billion check almost for Chipita. So bear that in mind. In terms of capital structure, we will continue generating cash flow, and I was very happy with the quality of the cash that came in into 2021. So I feel the first element, which is foundation of our capital structure, is there. And then clearly, at this point in time, if we had an acquisition that is similar to Give & Go or Chipita, et cetera, we will still be able to fund it. We obviously have our coffee stakes. And we have all it takes, including potentially switching off share buybacks to be able to phase an acquisition of the level that Give & Go and Chipita had been. Operator : And in the interest of time, I will now turn the program back to Dirk Van de Put for any closing remarks. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you. Well, in closing, we feel good about our 2021 performance across our key metrics, of course, including the top line growth. We see good volume, profitability was good and the cash generation was excellent. I want to reiterate that we are especially proud of our people, I believe the very best in the CPG industry. And by continuing to stay close to our consumers, we are confident that we have a bright future ahead. We remain focused on our consumer-centric growth strategy, that will not change. We will continue to improve our execution, and we will continue to invest and increasing our investment in our brands, in our talent and our capabilities.  As I look ahead towards '22, we expect continued pockets of volatility related to COVID or the inflation or the supply chain challenges. We continue to risk-adjust our plans to ensure that we can successfully navigate these periodic disruptions and deliver on our targets. So we enter 2022 with a good momentum in our categories and the vast majority of our geographies. Our global and local brands, as I explained, are on solid footing with strong levels of investment. We continue to augment the portfolio with growth accretive snacking assets, and we are excited about the opportunities to advance multi-category strength in our key markets. We are going to continue to expand distribution in emerging markets, and we're going to further accelerate close-in adjacencies and our high-growth segments. So I thank you for your time and for your investment and see you at the end of Q1. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, everyone. Operator : And this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Mondelez International First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by the Mondelez management and the question-and-answer session.  I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondelez. Please go ahead, sir. Shep Dunlap : Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO; and Luca Zaramella, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K, Q and 8-K filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. As we discuss our results today, unless noted as reported, we'll be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures, which adjust for certain items included in our GAAP results. In addition, we provide our year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. You can find the comparable GAAP measures and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation. In today's call, Dirk will provide a business and strategy update, then Luca will take you through our financial results and outlook. We will close with Q&A. Before turning it over to Dirk, a reminder that we have an investor update on May 10 and that will begin 9 Eastern, 8 Central where Dirk, Luca and other senior leaders will talk more about the evolution of our strategy. More details will be on our IR website soon. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dirk. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you Shep, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. I will start on slide 4. I am pleased to share that we have delivered an excellent start to the year with robust volume growth, solid pricing, strong growth profit dollar growth and high cash delivery. Strong demand for snacks fueled broad-based growth all around the world, with the chocolate and biscuit categories continuing to demonstrate resilience and price elasticity remaining below historical levels. We also continue to effectively navigate a dynamic environment characterized by global input cost inflation, as well as lingering disruptions in the supply chain, labor and transportation. Throughout the quarter, we succeeded in mitigating these challenges through ongoing cost discipline and strategic pricing actions. At the same time, we continue to invest to support our brands, our distribution, our capabilities and acquisitions. We remain confident that the strength of our brands, our proven strategy and our continued investments position us well to deliver attractive, sustainable growth for the remainder of 2022 and beyond. It is especially important to note that we remain extremely confident in our people, the very best in the CPG industry. Each and every day, our makers and bakers around the world remain focused on delivering high-quality, great tasting snacks to enrich the lives of consumers. No matter how the external environment shifts from one quarter to the next, our diverse and dedicated teams continue to deliver the brands our consumers love. Turning to slide 5. You can see that our strategy is continuing to drive a virtuous cycle. The strength of our brands are continuously increasing investments and significant pricing actions, our sustaining top line momentum and solid profitability and position us well for another strong year in 2022. Our first quarter results show that we are off to a strong start. We grew revenue this quarter by 8.6%. We delivered gross profit growth of 9.9% due to higher pricing and robust volume. Our A&C investments have increased high single digits, and we gained our health share across half of our revenue base. We increased operating income by 13.5% and delivered $1 billion in free cash flow. We view these results as a healthy indicator of our ability to continue to deliver on our long-term growth algorithm. As you can see on slide 6, we are now averaging a 4.7% quarterly revenue growth rate since 2019. We feel good about this strong and consistent track record. In the second half of 2018, we shifted our paradigm on how to generate elevated growth by focusing on gross profit dollar growth, local first commercial execution, a virtuous cycle of always increasing investments and a new approach to incentives. We are confident that this approach will continue to consistently deliver attractive growth. We also believe this performance demonstrates not only the strength of our execution, but the attractiveness and durability of our core categories of chocolate and biscuit. Against that backdrop, I'm now on slide 7. We are excited to provide some additional details on our recently announced acquisition of Ricolino, the number one sugar confectionery and number four chocolate player in our priority markets of Mexico. This strategic acquisition will enable us to double our size in Mexico, a key priority market for us and Latin America's second largest market after Brazil. Ricolino has a broad portfolio of iconic widely loved chocolate and candy brands include Ricolino, Vero, La Corona and Coronado. In addition to the taste of the nation brands, the organization's robust route-to-market infrastructure, which has more than 2,100 DSD routes that serve more than 440,000 traditional trade outlets will enable us to rapidly expand our share in biscuits and chocolate. We also will benefit from four new manufacturing facilities with strong production capabilities. We expect this acquisition to rapidly drive value. Ricolino has been growing at an 8% CAGR with solid profitability over the past five years and currently delivers more than $500 million in net revenue. Its high strategic fit transforms our business with now 75% of revenues coming from core snacking categories and great opportunities for both revenue and cost synergies. Like other companies, as shown on slide 8, we are experiencing a dynamic operating environment driven by global cost inflation and supply chain volatility. We condemn the war in Ukraine, which is not only causing great human suffering, but adds to an already very difficult cost and supply chain environment. Let's take a closer look at each of these dynamics and the steps we are taking to address them. First, we continue to face elevated input cost inflation, especially in the areas of energy, transportation, packaging, wheat, dairy and edible oils. To offset these challenges, we recently announced further pricing actions across key markets. Additionally, our commodity costs are about 85% hedged for the year and near fully hedged in key areas. We are also continuing to accelerate productivity and throughput initiatives. Second, we continue to manage through volatility in the supply chain, especially in the US, due to labor shortages at third parties, as well as a continuing gap between demand and supply of trucking capacity and containers. To offset these challenges, we are continuing to improve our manufacturing and warehouse capacity, prioritizing key SKUs and implementing new measures to support employee retention. And third, we are working through numerous challenges related to the ongoing war in Ukraine. I would now like to spend a few minutes addressing our actions to care for and protect our people, as well as our operations in the region. First and foremost, our thoughts are with the people of Ukraine and all those around the world with family, friends and loved ones who have been impacted. The current situation is devastating, and we condemn this senseless violence. We have taken a number of important steps to protect our colleagues, including strong financial support, border crossing assistance and help with finding housing. As part of these steps, we are continuing to pay our employees in Ukraine. Additionally, we are stepping up our commitment to relief efforts, dedicating so far 10 million to humanitarian support and food security. This includes donations to international and local aid organization focused on supporting all people in Ukraine, but also with a specific focus on the communities where we have plans. On top of financial donations, our teams are providing on-the-ground help. For instance, we have helped transfer more than 100 children from Ukraine to Turkey, secured diesel generators to help provide power to critical public facilities and we are making food available in Ukraine, including product donations and working with distributors. Our two manufacturing operations in Ukraine have been shut down since the war began. Unfortunately, our site in Trostyanets has suffered significant damage due to the substantial military action in the area. Our site in  also remains closed. Thankfully, none of our employees were injured at either facilities. It is too early to provide you with potential next steps for the facilities, but we will work to make these facilities operational when the local situation allows. In terms of our business in Russia, as a food company, we have scaled back all nonessential activities, including stopping all new capital investments, any planned product launches and line extensions, commercial sponsorships and advertising. We are focused on local production of shelf-stable packaged snacks that are staples in people's daily lives. We also continue to provide support to our colleagues. With that, I will hand over to Luca for more details on our financials. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Dirk, and good afternoon. Our first quarter performance was strong from top to bottom to cash flow. We delivered revenue growth of 8.6%, with nearly four points of that growth coming from volume mix. Emerging markets continue to show great strength, posting an increase of more than 16%, with strengths across all our major business units. Importantly, volume mix dropped nearly 10 points of this growth, with notable performances from Brazil India, China and Mexico. Developed markets grew 4.2% for the first quarter, with strength in both Europe and North America as demand remains strong. As for emerging markets, also, our developed market volume mix was positive, but pricing drove a good portion of that growth. Turning to our portfolio performance on slide 11. Chocolate and biscuits continue to demonstrate strong growth and drive our business. Gum and candy also increased significantly as many areas are at/or above pre-pandemic levels. Biscuits grew 6.7% for the quarter, with more than two points coming from volume mix. Similarly to Q4, emerging markets were a significant engine of growth in this category. Brazil, Mexico, India, Southeast Asia all grew double digit, while China posted high single-digit growth. Oreo, Chips Ahoy!, HU and Tae  are among those brands that deliver double-digit increases. Chocolate grew more than 8% for the quarter, with increases in both developed and emerging markets. Both global and local brands grew well, including Cadbury, Dairy Milk, Milka, Tobleron, Lacta and Riz . Gum and candy continued to show improvement with growth of 27% related to mobility increases. China, Brazil and Mexico were among some of the larger gum businesses posting strong performances. Now let's review our market share performance on slide 12. We held or gained share in approximately 50% of our revenue base during the quarter, with approximately 25 points of high win due to the inventory situation in the US and related out of stock. Our chocolate category continued to do well, with 70% of our revenue base holding or gaining share. While our biscuit category held or gained share in 40% of our revenue base, the impact driven by lower inventory levels in North America following the Q3 strike and continued labor shortages at third-party manufacturers is worth 40 points of headwind. We expect these dynamics to improve as we move into the second half of the year. A few of the more notable areas of share gains in Q1 include China, India, Brazil, Mexico, UK and France Biscuit; UK, Brazil and South Africa chocolate; and China gum. As we move into Q2, we expect our chocolate share to improve in several key markets in Europe and EMEA due to Easter timing where our portfolio is especially strong. Now turning to page 13. For the quarter, profitability was strong due to higher pricing, strong volume leverage and the benefit of hedges related to currency and commodities. Turning to regional performance on slide 14. Europe grew 4.9% during the quarter, supported by great execution, a strong Easter performance and continued recovery in the convenience away-from-home and travel retail channels. Our results were driven by 3.4 points of volume growth with strong increases in many markets, including the UK, as well as Central and Eastern Europe. In chocolate, we delivered our best Easter ever with strong sell-in and sellout for the UK and Germany. Biscuits also delivered strong mid-single-digit growth. OI dollar growth for the quarter was more than 10%, driven by continued volume leverage, pricing and strong cost control as well as favorable commodity ForEx hedges. North America grew 7.7% in Q1, driven by higher pricing in biscuits as well as double-digit gum and candy growth. Volume mix was slightly positive, despite lower service levels related to third-party labor constraints. North America OI increased by 13.6% during the quarter due to higher pricing. We announced an additional mid-single-digit pricing increase in the US that will become effective early May. EMEA grew 8.9% for the quarter with strong volume growth of 6.4%, showing continued strength across much of the region. India grew double digits for the quarter and continues to execute well and reinvest for the future. We continue to extend our leadership position in chocolate, while the growth of our biscuit business continues to outpace larger competitors in the region. China grew high single digits for the quarter, driven by continued share and gains in both biscuits and gum, despite several challenges due to COVID restrictions. Southeast Asia delivered high single-digit growth, with strength in biscuit, chocolate and beverages. EMEA increased OI dollars by 5.8% for the quarter, volume-driven profit was partially offset by commodities and transportation inflation. Latin America grew more than 25% for the quarter, with strong growth across all categories, driven by both strong pricing and volume mix gains. Brazil, Mexico and our Western Andean business unit all posted double-digit increases this quarter. Adjusted OI dollars for Latin America increased more than 30% for the quarter. These increases were driven by broad-based volume growth across core snacking categories, effective pricing through RGM actions and the mix impact of higher gum and candy sales. Moving to EPS. Q1 EPS grew 13.9% at constant currency. This growth was primarily driven by top line-driven operating gains. Turning to free cash flow and capital return on slide 16. We delivered Q1 free cash flow of \u20ac1 billion, driven by strong operating results and further improvements in our cash conversion cycle. We also returned $1.3 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Let me make a few comments with respect to the Ukraine. We stopped all business in Ukraine as the war began, including our two plants in the country that produce products for both Ukraine and broader Europe. In total, this represents about $320 million in revenues on a yearly basis. As a result of this business stoppage, we expect asset write-offs and one-time costs of approximately $143 million, which will be excluded from our adjusted results. For the remainder of 2022, we expect about $200 million in revenue headwinds from the loss of revenue in Ukraine as well as losses related to finished goods that our Ukraine plant produce for other countries within Europe, where we do not have supply alternative yet. The lost revenue is expected to translate into $0.03 lower EPS. Now let me provide some color on our revised 2022 outlook on slide 19. We now expect 4% plus top line growth. This factors in the $200 million or roughly one point of negative impact currently anticipated from the Ukraine war in addition to our expectations that we will return to more historical levels of elasticity later this year. We continue to expect pricing to be a larger driver of top line growth, given its impact in Q1 and we are also announcing price increases across a number of markets for the rest of the year tied to inflation. We now expect input cost inflation in the low double-digit range for 2022 versus our prior view of approximately 8%, despite our coverage is approaching 90% for the year. The revise view of inflation reflects the war in the Ukraine and the related step-up in cost pressure to our commodity basket, including energy, wheat, oil and packaging. As I said, we also expect additional pricing in a number of markets connected to this inflation, and these actions could cause an increase in elasticity versus what we are seeing today. As a result, we have planned accordingly. As we gave you guidance for 2022, we had some headroom. So we still feel we have an opportunity to hit high single-digit EPS. But the situation is very volatile. And given these dynamics, we believe it is prudent to call a range of EPS growth between mid-single to high single digit. This also factors in ongoing investment to support our brands and work in media increases that, in some cases, might be increased, given good business momentum to protect versus elasticity driven by incremental price increases. Our outlook also now factors in $0.17 of headwind related to ForEx impact. $0.06 of this amount was included in our first quarter results. With respect to free cash flow, our view is unchanged as we continue to expect another year of \u20ac3 billion plus. With that, let's open the line for questions. Operator :  We'll take our first question from John Baumgartner of Mizuho Securities. John Baumgartner : Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. Dirk Van de Put : Hi. Luca Zaramella : Hi John. John Baumgartner : Maybe, Dirk, just first starting off, just given the volatility we're seeing globally, wondering if you can offer a bit of the state of the union in terms of any notable call-outs across your geographies and categories? Dirk Van de Put : Yes. Well, I would say if I would phrase in one -- phrase, it's a fast-changing and complex environment that our demand is strong, and our momentum is sustained. If I think about the complex environment, we all know about the geopolitical conflict. There's still some pockets of COVID, particularly in China at the moment, but also Southeast Asia. We are seeing absolutely record inflation. And the supply chain disruption is still there. So probably one of the more difficult periods that I have known in my career from an operational perspective. At the same time, the demand for our product is very strong. And if you look at the quarter, for instance, in chocolate, we grew our revenues by 8.1%, and that was accompanied also by very strong volume growth, which was 5.8%. And then in biscuits, our biggest category, we grew revenue by 6.7% and volume was 2.2%. All regions performed well. They're all growing 5% or more. We continue to invest in our brands. We did not pull back on our investments. So we are going to continue to do that this year because we are in a high pricing environment and we believe we need to keep our supporting our brands. And despite all that, we are delivering very good dollar profit growth. We have double digit -- strong double-digit OI growth, and that was driven by pricing RGM and the volume growth. If I look to emerging markets and developed markets, emerging markets continue to be a very strong growth engine for us, double-digit revenue growth, strong double-digit revenue growth in Q1 and also last year, accompanied by 10% volume growth. We have strength in China, India, Brazil. And as you know, we believe we still have plenty of opportunity in these markets as it relates to distribution and white space. Developed markets are solid, although we still have constraints in our US supply chain, but we see it gradually improving. There was a significant step up in North America. So we had strong growth, a step-up in pricing. We are already going to implement at the beginning of May another round of mid-single digit pricing. And as I said, we're making good progress on supply chain and inventory, but there's still a lot of work to do there. Europe for us was also very good, volume-led growth of 5%. We had record Easter results, which you cannot yet see in our market share result because Easter is later this year, but we know it's a very strong Easter. The consumer in Europe, there's a lot of questions about it, is still solid, fully aware about inflationary pressures and so on, the underlying data show that the consumer is still buying our products very strongly. And then if I summarize it all, I would say, it is a complex environment, but we feel very confident about our future. I think we're in the right categories. We have the right strategy. Our brands are strong. We increased our investment in them every year. We have great people. Our execution is good and we have the right mindset. We will have to work through this near-term inflation, which got worse due to the Ukraine situation and the supply chain headwinds we still have to go through. So we remain focused on what we can control, our pricing, in-store execution and very strong cost discipline. I hope that gives you an idea. John Baumgartner : Yeah. That's great. Thank you. And just as a follow-up, in terms of the Ricolino acquisition, you touched on it in your remarks a bit, but could you elaborate on the synergy opportunities. And any other elements that attract you to the business that may be less apparent to outsiders? I know Mexico is not a market that's seen a lot of discussion traditionally. Dirk Van de Put : Yes. Well, for us, we consider it as a very high strategic fit for us to become a full snacking player. Mexico is a priority market for us. And our business there is largely in gum and in our meals business. And we are interested in becoming a bigger snacking player in Mexico plus the per capita consumption that we have. Roughly comparing to our other emerging markets, Mexico has potential for us, and we are very interested into the chocolate market also. Our biscuit business is developing, but could use some acceleration. So Ricolino offers us a strong route to market, combined with an already very strong presence in the market, particularly in confectionery and in chocolate. And that helps us to get to our ambition of about 15% to 20% market share in the biscuits and the chocolate market. And starting from their already strong position and combining that with our existing business, the two businesses are about the same size. This will mean for us that we are now 75% a snacking player, which is also very important for us. And what you might not have picked up, but which you can probably expect is that there will be a full integration. So there's a significant opportunity because of that full integration, for revenue and cost synergies, which would be accretive to our growth and margin in Mexico and Latin America. So maybe quickly a bit of the numbers on Ricolino, so about $500 million in net revenue. In the sugar confectionery and chocolate categories, they have about a 15% share in the combined categories, the number one in confection, number four in chocolate. The two categories together are about $3 billion in Mexico, and the growth of those categories are expected to be 7% for the next five years. And Ricolino, we expect because of their iconic local brands, we expect them to be above that, about 8%. You probably will not know any of the brands, but they're very known locally. What -- so we're interested in the categories there's in the brands. But then second, as I already mentioned, the route to market, 2,100 plus DSD routes reaching 440,000 mom-and-pop stores. That triples almost quadruples our route to market in Mexico. And, of course, we have a very strong modern trade presence ourselves where we can help Ricolino become stronger. What we also have to keep in mind is that they have a high-growth US business. They're the leader in confectionary in Hispanic markets in the US. And so we believe that there is an opportunity there to significantly increase that business. 10% of their sales are coming from the US Hispanic market. And as you know, the population in the US, the Hispanic population in the US is growing fast. We're also getting four excellent manufacturing facilities, which will help us produce the necessary products for the growth. So I think that gives you an idea, hopefully. John Baumgartner : Yeah, that's great. Thanks Luca -- sorry Dirk. And just last one for Luca, if I could. Looking at the guide for 2022, stronger top line despite Ukraine, wider range for EPS. It sounds as though you've embedded a fair amount of uncertainty in the model. I know forecast announced was really tough. But how do we think about the puts and takes and maybe where might the outlook prove conservative in terms of modeling potential downside? Thank you. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, John. As I said in the prepared remarks, I think it is fair to say that we feel quite confident about 2022 being another good year, both in terms of top and bottom lines, despite the numerous challenges that are thrown at us. I think we've mentioned how vibrant chocolate and biscuit businesses are. And I think when you look at volume mix and the pricing that is kicking in, that is the testament really of the big investments we have been making over the last few years and the fact that our franchises are very strong. It is undeniable that the geopolitical environment is driving additional costs. And just to give you a reference, inflation is now expected to be double digit versus the high single digits we had originally estimated. And that will result in additional and multiple pricing waves across the board, across all our categories, quite frankly, since energy particularly has repercussions around a vast number of commodity classes. As we price away unprecedented inflation, clearly, the watch out is elasticity. And I want to make sure that you realize that we have planned for historical elasticity\u2019s for the remainder part of the year. And so I wanted to be a little bit cautious in our forecast since at this point in time, we are not seeing that level elasticity. And I also want to make sure that we'll realize that by having invested materially in the last three years, our brands are as strong as they have ever been. So we certainly have an opportunity to do better on our revenue guidance. But again, quite frankly, if you slip out the Ukrainian impact, you realize that we are two points ahead of the original guidance on net revenue that we gave you at the beginning of the year. On the profit side, as we guided to high single-digit EPS, we had built into some cushion in our forecast. So we still have an opportunity to meet high single-digit EPS growth. But this situation is tighter than before because of the inflation and the Ukrainian related business losses, and those accounts for around about $0.13 of EPS. This is why we are now giving you a range to accommodate for further headwinds that might come our way. But in case of elasticity\u2019s being more benign and more aligned to what we see today. And in the case of cost not worsening materially versus the double-digit inflation that I mentioned, high single-digit EPS is within reach. Obviously, we want to get to high single-digit EPS. And that's why, for instance, we are doubling down on cost initiatives. And there are streams within the company to ensure that on the productivity and cost control side, we do even better than we have been doing in the last few years. And so hopefully, if the situation doesn't worse and the elasticity\u2019s are better high single digit would be within reach. John Baumgartner : Thanks Luca. Thanks Dirk. Very helpful. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you John. Operator : Our next question is from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Ken Goldman : Hi, thank you. And I hope that your employees and their families in Ukraine are safe and doing as well as they can under the circumstances. And I would back up what John was getting at, it does feel very low, 4% seems almost punitively low given 1Q strength. And I'm just -- my question, again, just to back up -- or my question would be just to back up what he was suggesting, if your pricing is going to accelerate, and it was almost 5% in the first quarter, and you're guiding to volumes being positive for the year, just mathematically, how do we get to 4%? It just feels like that's almost too low if pricing is going to be above 5% and volume is going to be positive. I just don't quite get how 4% is even in the cards if those two elements of guidance are there. I hope that makes sense. Luca Zaramella : I mean, from your logic, it really -- it makes sense. The point here though is; A, we have one point of headwind related to the Ukrainian business stoppage. You might imagine that in places like Russian, for instance, there are restrictions, both in terms of importing. And as we mentioned a few times, we have scaled back operations. So volume there is going to be negative as well. And on top of that, as we have multiple pricing waves, as I said, we have planned for higher elasticity than what we are seeing at the moment. If we get better elasticity\u2019s and we implement pricing policy as we have done in the last few rounds, there is obviously an opportunity to go higher in terms of revenue. But I wanted to be cautious because, clearly, the situation is quite fluid. You might imagine that in some places, we are getting to price increases that are more than double digit, I would say -- not double digit, but in the 15-plus percent, that's the number we are talking about. And so elasticity remains to be seen at these levels, and I wanted to be cautious. Ken Goldman : And just to clarify, though, that when you say that elasticity is being baked in at a higher level than today and back-to-normal levels, and you talk about Ukraine and Russia, and I understand there's some uncertainty in there, too. That is all baked into your estimate of volume hopefully being positive for the year, nonetheless, correct? Luca Zaramella : Yes. Yes, it is. Ken Goldman : Okay. And then just one last quick one for me. As we think about the remaining quarters, are there any considerations we should have, Luca, in mind when modeling each quarter, whether in terms of top line comparisons that may not be obvious, whether hard or easy with the pace of inflation? Luca Zaramella : Look, the only one thing you have to bear in mind is that last year, in Q3, we had the strike impact in the US, which obviously affected some of the revenue phasing in the US. But besides that, the only one thing that you had to think is about sequential pricing being higher throughout the quarters. Ken Goldman : Okay. Thanks so much. Luca Zaramella : Thank you Ken. Operator : We'll take our next question from Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Great. Thanks very much. I wanted to dig in a little bit on North America. Organic there was close to 8% in the quarter. And I think consumption or takeaway has been closer to maybe 4% or so. So I guess, given some of the supply chain issues that you're still dealing with, how have you been shipping so far ahead of consumption, and I guess, and also still losing market share in that market? I'm just trying to get a better handle on that. Dirk Van de Put : Yes. Well, Andrew, we do have a number of businesses in North America, our ventures, which are not followed by Nielsen. So if we think about Give & Go, for instance, or even Perfect Bar. They don't have the same coverage as the rest of our business. You will also imagine that, we came out of the strike, and we had subsequent high demand that our inventory levels in the trade were not as high as we would like them to be. So the combination of those two factors give that difference between the 4% and the 8% that you were talking about. Andrew Lazar : Thanks for that. And then, Luca, maybe if we look at the difference between, let's say, high single-digit constant currency EPS growth in mid to high single digit, if that's how it turns out. Maybe could you just break out the -- I guess, there were three key buckets there. I think you said, $0.03 was due to Russia-Ukraine. It sounded like another maybe dime, if I'm hearing you right, on supply chain. And then what would the cost inflation piece be? Again, just trying to bridge from high single digit to whatever turns out to be potentially somewhere below that? Thank you very much. Luca Zaramella : It is another $0.10 of cost headwind as we -- as I said in -- to the reply to John, between the Ukrainian business laws and the revenue that came out of the plant last year in the Ukraine and the additional cost pressure driven by the Ukraine war I see another $0.10. And so between the two, it is $0.13 of EPS. Now, as I said, the high single digits, quite frankly, at this point, is predicated on elasticity. The elasticity\u2019s are better than what we have baked into the forecast, it will be high single-digit EPS, if elasticity\u2019s are more in line with historical levels of one plus, then I think we will have a little bit lower than high single-digit EPS growth. Andrew Lazar : And the supply chain piece, I didn't know if that was included in the $0.13 because you have those three buckets on that slide? Luca Zaramella : Yeah, it is all included in there. Andrew Lazar : Okay. Thanks very much. Luca Zaramella : Welcome. Operator : We'll take our next question from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : Thanks operator, and good afternoon Dirk and Luca. Luca Zaramella : Hi Bryan. Bryan Spillane : So a couple of questions, quick ones, I hope. First is just maybe a follow-up to Ken Goldman's question about like phasing through the year. I think on slide 19, there's a comment in there that says you're expecting year-over-year profit dollar growth throughout 2022. So was that meant to be like each quarter? Is there any kind of variability in terms of, I guess, margin or profit growth per quarter? Just trying to understand if there's anything more behind that bullet? Luca Zaramella : No, don't read too much into that. Obviously, we are expecting OI dollar growth throughout the quarters. We have to see how cost evolves throughout the quarters because as I said, we have baked into the forecast, the current cost levels. We are pretty much well covered for commodities for the remainder of the year. So at this point, I would say, yes, that's the idea, depending, as I said a few times, on elasticity there might be some bumps in the road, but that's the plan at the moment. Bryan Spillane : Okay. And then the second one is just, Luca, how do we think about -- or how are you preparing for the potential for maybe like the inavailability of maybe some input costs or other resource -- inputs ingredients or other inputs. I guess, given there's going to be certainly scarcity of wheat, it looks like -- and maybe some other raw materials. Just is that a factor that has that been factored into your forecast? And just is there any risk associated with that as we go through the balance of the year? Luca Zaramella : The -- that is factored into the plan. I have to say, at this exact moment in time. Clearly, we are facing some shortages, but they have no been a material impact yet to the business. So the plan in terms we have is extra cost will get us the commodities we need. You might have heard about the palm oil issue in Indonesia. That one for us is not a material issue at this point in time. We are clearly monitoring the situation very closely. In terms of wheat, the wheat coming out of the Ukraine is mostly going into the Middle East and North Africa for us. As I said in the last call, the total wheat we procure for the company is $600 million, $700 million. So in the big scheme of things, we believe that in total, wheat is not going to be a material problem in terms of supply. It hasn't been yet, but we have to see how the crop evolves and what can still be sourced out of the Ukraine, particularly for our Middle East and North African business. Bryan Spillane : And just if I could follow up on that. If we're looking at maybe some of the petrochemical related, like, packaging, especially in Europe, given just all of the disruption in energy there. Is there any risk around just availability of packaging, especially in Europe? Luca Zaramella : We are facing some issues on specific items, but the issues are not broad-based. Paper and -- particularly in places like Asia, it is under a lot of pressure at this point. But again, in terms of supply, we have some issues here and there, but nothing that racks up to a material number for the company yet. And I hope it stays that that way. Bryan Spillane : Yeah. So do I. All right. Thanks Luca. Thanks Dirk. Luca Zaramella : Thank you. Dirk Van de Put : Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Growe of Stifel. Chris Growe : Hi. Good evening. Dirk Van de Put : Hi Chris. Chris Growe : Hi. I just had two questions for you, if I could, please. So the first one, I'm just curious about just to dig a little bit more into the pricing, Europe was an area where I think you've talked before about some pricing coming into place after Easter, like in April. I just want to get a sense of that we should see that pick up in the second quarter. And that has historically been a very difficult area to get pricing. Is that an area where you think your pricing can offset inflation in -- broadly in Europe? Dirk Van de Put : Yeah. So we've talked about the higher inflationary impact. We took pricing across all our markets in Q1, including Europe. So far, the demand for the category is pretty robust. But it's very likely that we will have to take another price increase in Europe. And in fact, we are going out to the clients right now. That probably is reflected on our forecast, and we're trying to be prudent there because that is not happening a lot in Europe that you have to do a second pricing. And so we will have to see what the reaction is, and we've taken a cautious approach on any potential effects that we could have from that. We do expect that we will be able in Europe and in most of our markets to already be pricing away most of the inflation of this year and then be ready at the beginning of next year to whatever gap exists with the cost picture for 2023 that we will also be able to do that pricing. So, that leads to what Luca was saying, a very significant pricing increases around the world. As we also were saying so far so good, elasticity has been quite low. But we -- the second area where we're trying to be very careful is planning for historical levels. For instance, I believe that at the end -- sorry, at the beginning of 2023, the basket for the US consumer will be up compared to the beginning of 2021 more than 20%. And so we forecast that the elasticity will go back to historical levels. Our categories have historically been very resilient. So, despite this high inflation, despite the high pricing, we know that our categories are pretty good. One of the things we're seeing, for instance, is that this -- the fact that everything is going up, not just food, consumers continue to prioritize grocery spending. It's more on personal items, floating, eating out, travel. Those are the items where they're trying to save. So, that also gives us confidence implement the pricing and continue with the volumes. But again, we're trying to be careful and cautious, and we will have to see how it goes. It's a very volatile environment at the moment. Chris Growe : Okay. Thank you for that. And I had just one quick follow-on. Did you give a level of inflation for the first quarter? I think we're looking at double-digit inflation now for the year. Does that pick up then as we go through the remaining quarters, or was the first quarter at that level? I'm just trying to get a sense of the gross margin. Does that get a little more challenging before it gets better before the pricing comes in place, or is that a function of inflation picking up here? Luca Zaramella : The level of inflation, it is higher in Q1 for obvious reasons because you know that last year, the inflation picked up materially towards the second part of the year. And it caught us a little bit by surprise, the level that we saw in the second part of the year. And obviously, the level of gross margin in Q1 is reflective of three key elements. One, it is the additional pricing. When you look, for instance, at the US business, you clearly see a level of revenue that is 8% with a modest volume mix impact, which means there is 8% pricing kicking in, in there. The second element is the fact that there is good volume growth in Q1 that provides leverage. And the third level is the protection in terms of hedges that we put in place in terms of commodities and ForEx. So, as you think about inflation going down in the remainder part of the year, it will go down year-on-year, but the level is still going to be higher in terms of absolute dollars, and we will have to price accordingly. The volume might not be as high as the 4% that you saw in Q1. And so that will have a play into the gross margin evolution over the quarter. So I think assuming that you're going to see an 80 basis point decline given all the pricing we are about to take might not be necessarily realistic. The goal that we have though is that we want to enter 2023 with the level of pricing at current commodity and ForEx cost that allows us to have a level of -- is more aligned to historical levels. Chris Growe : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you for your time. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you Chris. Operator : Our next question is from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Good evening folks. Thanks for slotting me in. Dirk Van de Put : Hi Jason. Luca Zaramella : Hi Jason. Jason English : Hi. I guess a couple of quick questions. First, to follow-up on the next wave of pricing in Europe. Have you approached the trade yet? How is it going? Because I believe this is close to sort of on-charter territory to be pushing through multiple rounds, at least in Continental Europe in the course of one year. Dirk Van de Put : Yeah, it's just brand new, so I cannot give you any feeling yet of where that stands. I think it's important to realize that within an extraordinary situation and that we will have all the necessary conversations with our trade partners and making sure that it's a win-win for everybody involved. But it's too early to give you an idea of where the negotiations will lead. Jason English : Got it. Okay. And the DSD route to Mexico that you're acquiring sound really interesting. Can you give us a little more color on what your current route to market is? And whether or not, I assume these are all company-owned, can you confirm that? And how long or should be -- I imagine we should expect, but how long do you think it will take for you to reroute the entire network to be able to get one route to market that you can efficiently maximize the loads of these trucks with? Luca Zaramella : Okay. So the DSD is an own system. The -- there are some contact points between the current beam of network and the Ricolino. So one of the things we will have to do is to carve out and create a little bit of additional infrastructure on our side, but nothing at this point, I would say that is worrisome. I feel quite good about the reach that Ricolino is going to have with 2,100 DSD route achieving 440,000 moms-and-pops, which is really where when you look at our biscuit business in Mexico, being at 5% share of total market, the opportunity lies. And on the other side, our Mexico sales complement, the strong model trade presence with our some modern trade presence what Ricolino has. And we feel like between revenue and cost synergies, this is going to be a material enhancement to the value of Mondelez. And so we are very, very excited. On top of that, the brands are very strong. And as Dirk said, particularly in the US, we see tremendous opportunities in pushing this brand through what is a cohort that is growing and has tremendous potential. Jason English : Yeah. Sounds compelling. Thank you. I\u2019ll pass it on. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you, Jason. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Lavery of Piper Sandler. Michael Lavery : Thank you. Good evening. Dirk Van de Put : Hi. Luca Zaramella : Hi. Michael Lavery : Just was curious if you could dissect the volume mix a little bit and maybe help us understand if there's any notable mix shifts to keep in mind as we think about the volumes. Are you seeing down trading? Obviously, the elasticities have held up really well so far. But when you lump those together, we don't get as much a sense of the split. Can you give an idea a little bit of how that breaks out? Luca Zaramella : Look, in total for the company, the mix component is very, very neutral. It hasn't been a problem. It hasn't been an upside either. And the simple way you have to think about it is North America is one of the most profitable operations that we have. And as we address the question of Andrew Lazar, Dirk said that the new businesses that we acquired are up, while our biscuit business in terms of volume is still below last year. And one of the reasons why that this is, A, we are lapping, clearly, tremendous growth last year in terms of volume. But also, as I look closely to the numbers, the supply-related issues that we have are causing still quite a bit of volume track compared to what it could be otherwise. On the flip side, as you saw, gum is growing very, very healthily as a category gum can be, I think, 27%, and that number obviously is mix accretive. The other one that is mix accretive, it is about world travel retail, which is picking up nicely quarter-after-quarter, albeit it is not still at the level it is not yet at the level before the pandemic. So, these are the three key mix components, North America volume being down because of supply chain issues, gum being up and world travel retail being up all the rest in terms of mix, I would say, fairly neutral in its totality, and these three elements offset each other. Michael Lavery : Okay, that's great. That's really helpful. And can I just follow-up on the buybacks. You still have a pretty elevated cash balance relative to historical levels. But even with the Ricolino deal, you're still expecting about $2 billion for this year. You've said you'll finance that deal with debt and cash. Is it a good portion of debt, or I guess just with $750 million of buybacks already in Q1, could there potentially be upside to that $2 billion number over the course of the year? Luca Zaramella : Look, let's stay tuned. The -- at this point, I feel that we have what it takes to be able to fund the $2 billion of buybacks. I'll provide a little bit more color around this at our Investor Day. Michael Lavery : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Luca Zaramella : Thank you. Operator : Our final question comes from Alexia Howard of Bernstein. Alexia Howard : Good evening everyone. Luca Zaramella : Hey Alexia. Dirk Van de Put : Hi Alexia. Alexia Howard : I got a couple of questions. Firstly, on the emerging markets, the biggest pushbacks that I get at the moment is people concerned that as food prices escalate around the world, and the cost of basic food becomes a higher proportion of people's income in a lot of these low-income countries, that could choke off sales of more discretionary items like packaged snack food. How do you respond to that in terms of your confidence of sustained growth in the emerging markets in the face of that dynamic over the next year or so? And then I have a quick follow-up. Dirk Van de Put : Yes. I think as I was saying before, what we're seeing at the moment, we see that in developed and in emerging markets, the shift that the consumer is making as they are being confronted with inflationary pressure are more into their discretionary spending into eating out, travel and so on. And we see that also in emerging markets where at this moment, there is food inflation, of course, but that we don't see a reduction in the basket of what they're buying. The second thing I would say is that the discretionary part of snacking is, I would argue, that, it's not so discretionary anymore with the modern consumers. Snacking is a big part of what they do. And for instance, in China, as people are going into lockdowns, we see an increase in salt biscuits happening because they considered it as a staple of their diet. And so I wouldn't just assume that snacks are discretionary. There are whole parts of snacking that are part of how consumers eat these days. And then three, I would say we also work very carefully and particularly in places like India or in Brazil, our RGM approach is very developed. They have a whole plan the \u2013 year-after-year are absorbing the different inflations that they see. And so the price increase might not be as direct as you would assume for the consumer. So because of those three elements, I think you continue to see very strong performance in our emerging markets. We \u2013 at this stage, we see no effect whatsoever of the price increases. And in fact, as I was saying, the volume increase has been 10%. So obviously, you can never say never, but so far so good. Alexia Howard : Great. Thank you very much. And then just finally, any quick preview comments about the Investor Day next month. I know, you've just mentioned that there might be something around the share buybacks, but is there anything else that we should be expecting? And thank you very much for the question. I look forward to seeing you next month. Shep Dunlap : Sure. Alexia, this is Shep. A few things, I mean, look, I think this is more evolutionary in terms of the strategy and what you're going to hear, certainly going to get a deep dive especially with respect to biscuit and chocolate. And then you're going to hit a little bit more about capital allocation just in general in terms of how we're thinking about that. As well, I would expect to hear from some other folks on the team just in terms of our efforts around marketing, what we're doing with the sales organization and supply chain. So hopefully, we'll cover all bases. But to give you an idea, just in terms of where our heads are at as we look to accelerate going forward and give you some proof points to leverage off. Alexia Howard : Great. Thank you very much. See you in a few weeks time. Dirk Van de Put : Well, thank you, everybody. Thanks for your presence here. Obviously, looking forward to see all of you during our Investor Day on 10th of May, and see you then. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, everyone.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Mondelez International Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about 1 hour, including remarks by Mondelez management and the question-and-answer session. . I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondelez. Please go ahead, sir. Shep Dunlap : Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. With me today are : Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO; and Luca Zaramella, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website, mondelezinternational.com/investors. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K, Q and 8-K filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. As we discuss our results today, unless noted as reported, we'll be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures, which adjust for items included in our GAAP results. In addition, we provide our year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis unless otherwise noted. You can find the comparable GAAP measures and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the presentation. Today's call, Dirk will provide a business and strategy update, then Luca will take you through our financial results and our outlook. We will close with Q&A. With that, I'll turn the call over to Dirk. Dirk Van de Put : Thanks, Shep, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. I will start on Slide 4. I'm pleased to share that we have delivered a strong first half of the year with robust volume growth and solid pricing execution that supports raising our full year growth outlook to 8% plus. Our core chocolate and biscuit businesses continue to demonstrate volume and pricing resilience. As consumers around the world continue to seek out our trusted and iconic brands to meet their snacking needs.  And although we may see a more mixed consumer sentiment in the near term, given the macro environment, we expect the consumers to consume more at home and be more selective in the brands they buy, which we believe to be a net positive for. We also continue to effectively navigate a dynamic operating environment. Input cost inflation remains challenging. And although we may see commodity inflation beginning to ease, we expect other costs like wages to show significant inflation. Our strong track record in having cost efficiency and simplification positions us well to mitigate the impact of these inflationary factors. At the same time, our consistent results enable us to maintain our course in driving a virtuous cycle where strong net revenue and gross profit or to continuous investment in our brands, distribution capabilities and acquisitions. We also continue to make great progress in reshaping our portfolio. A great example of that is our agreement to acquire Clif Bar, which will improve our position in the attractive and fast-growing snack bar category. I'll share some additional context on the exciting in a few minutes. Along with the Clif acquisition, we announced plans to divest our developed market Gum & Halls businesses, allowing us to focus our portfolio and further invest in our faster-growing businesses of chocolate and biscuits. We remain confident that the strength of our brands, our proven strategy and our increasing investments position us well to deliver attractive sustainable growth for the remainder of 2022 and beyond. Above all, I'm extremely confident in our people, who continue to demonstrate exceptional passion and dedication to serving our consumers despite ongoing challenges with inflation, supply and periodic in COVID conditions. Day in and day out are 80,000-plus makers and bakers strive to help people snack right. We respect and honor our colleagues around the world, and we truly believe that team Mondelez is a very theme in the consumer packaged goods industry. Turning to Slide 5. You can see that our strategy is continuing to drive a virtuous cycle. The strength of our brands, increasing investments, volume growth and significant pricing actions are sustaining top line momentum and solid profitability despite substantial inflation. We grew revenue this quarter by 13.1% and 10.7% for the first half of the year. We delivered gross profit growth of 9.7% due to healthy volume growth and pricing actions. Our A&C investments have increased double digits as to gain or hold share across more than half our revenue base and positioning us well for future periods. An example of our commitment to brand investment is the renovation of Milka to make this leading chocolate brand, most tenders and creamy ever. This program includes an upgraded taste profile, premier and bent and distinctive packaging, celebrating the brand's Alpine soul. This initiative represents our largest chocolate brand renovation in 25 years. Illustration of the campaign is featured on our earnings presentation coverage page. We are supporting the launch with a fully-integrated 18-month marketing and advertising support program starting in H2 '22. And last, we increased operating income by 8.5% for the quarter and 11.2% in the first half while delivering great free cash flow results. As you can see on Slide 6, we delivered 10 points growth during the first half of the year. We view this strong performance as evidence that our long-term strategy continues to pay off. In late 2018, we launched a new growth plan focused on gross profit dollar growth, local first commercial execution, a virtuous cycle of increasing investment and a new approach to incentives. We are confident that this approach will continue to consistently deliver attractive growth. Importantly, we are also delivering strong volume, which is important to Mondelez. It is a proof that consumers are eating more of our products every day and an indication of sustainable long-term growth. Like many companies, as shown on Slide 7, we are experiencing a dynamic operating environment driven by global cost inflation, supply chain volatility and currency headwinds. Let's take a closer look at each of these dynamics and the steps we are taking to address them. First, we continue to elevated input cost inflation especially in the areas of energy, transportation, packaging, wheat, dairy and edible oils. To offset these challenges, we recently announced further pricing actions across key markets, and continue to do appropriate action to hedge our commodity costs along with ongoing productivity and cost reduction initiatives. Second, we continue to manage through volatility in the supply chain, especially in the United States due to labor shortages at third parties as well as the continuing gap in demand and supply of trucking capacity containers. Although we do have more work to do, we are making progress against our plans to unlock manufacturing warehouse capacity, improve service levels and implement new measures to support employee retention.  Third, we are working through the impact of the strengthening U.S. dollar particularly against the euro and the British pound by focusing on what we can control. This includes mitigating our translation exposure through currency hedges and net investment hedges. Delivering a real dollar earnings is an ongoing focus. And though we may see some significant currency trends in the short term, we have delivered robust real dollar earnings growth over the past several years. Turning to our categories and the consumer on Page 8. Our annual state of snacking survey shows that consumers increasingly prefer snacking over traditional meals. And because snacking plays such an important role in consumers' lives, our core categories of chocolate and biscuits historically have resilience to economic downturns and pricing actions. This trend continues to play out around the world despite an overall drop in consumer confidence. While developed consumers express growing frustration with rising prices for a broad range of goods and services, they continue to perceive chocolate and biscuits as affordable indulgences and an important pick-me-up. In fact, almost 40% of U.K. shoppers said that chocolate is a necessity and remains one of the best valued snack products. Due to enduring consumer loyalty, category volume growth and penetration is holding up well in most of our key developments. Elasticity have notched up slightly but remained low compared to historical benchmarks. Private label is either flat or down in the vast majority of our markets, and shoppers say they are much less likely to switch to private label in chocolate and biscuits compared to other categories. Meantime, in emerging markets, consumer confidence remains relatively strong, recovering to almost pre-COVID levels. And our core category shows solid volume and penetration growth despite price increases. Compared to developed markets, emerging market consumers are less likely to reduce overall consumption of our categories or switch when faced with price increases. Instead, they are more likely to switch stores to find deals on their favorite brands or look for different sizes. Overall, we remain confident that the strength of our beloved and trusted brands will continue to help us navigate inflationary periods like the one we have today. Moving to our efforts around portfolio reshape on Slide 9. I'd like to share a bit more color on our recently announced agreement to acquire Clif Bar. Clif is a leader in growth, well-being snackbars. The company's own-trend brands including Clif, Luna and Clif Kids, a greater to our global snacking portfolio, and they are differentiated this page. Each of these brands is strong and healthy. pretty high advocacy and loyalty. Clif also enjoys high brand loyalty among the 18 to 24 age group. The brand also performs well on key tastes a critical differentiation across age groups in a category where many products does so well. Clif is also widely recognized as a leader in well-being and sustainable snacking. The company's purpose and culture are well aligned with our purpose of empowering people to snack right. We look forward to working with the passionate, dedicated Clif team to advance our shares. On Slide 10, you can see that we have moved from a small bar business in 2018 to about $300 million last year with the addition of perfect Snacks in Grenade and to a $1 billion-plus global snack bar platform factoring Clif. This gives us an attractive position in a $16 billion market with revenues roughly split between U.S. and international. As a significant 700 million-plus presence in the U.S., protein and energy space, which is expected to continue to grow well over the coming years as a diverse range of consumers increasingly count snack bars as meal replacements, energy or a better way of snacking. Slide 11 shows that the Clif Bar acquisition offers an opportunity for us to do business to our marketing expertise, operational excellence and financial discipline to create significant value. There are clear and substantial cost synergies, which include leveraging our experience with logistics and warehousing, reducing waste in existing and ties in marketing and advertising to optimize A&C spend. In terms of growth, we see substantial opportunities to increase household penetration and distribution in alternative and e-commerce as well as existing outlets. There is also an opportunity to unlock growth through revenue growth management and enhanced in-store excellence. And beyond the U.S., there are clear opportunities to drive international growth. We are excited about the announcement to acquire the Clif business and the top and bottom line growth opportunities that lie ahead. We also see material upside to the returns versus our low cost of capital. Moving to Slide 12. Clif is just the latest example of our continuing efforts to reshape our portfolio through strategic M&A that increases our exposure to incremental fast-growing snacking segment. Since we announced our growth strategy in 2018, we have completed or announced 9 acquisitions that strengthen and complement our portfolio and fill key gaps adding more than $2.8 billion in annual revenues and averaging growth in the high single digits. So 2022, in addition to announcing the Clif transaction, we have closed and integrated our acquisition of Chipita, a high-growth European leader in croissants and baked goods. And announced an agreement via Ricolino, Mexico's leading company for Bimbo. These strategic acquisitions will complement and build on our substantial M&A progress in 2021, which brought us a leading U.K. performance nutrition company, Gourmet Fola leading Australian premium biscuit and cracker company and Hu, a well-being snacking company in -- These acquisitions have been regional in nature, we can largely be managed by local teams. This includes the recent Chipita acquisition, which we successfully and rapidly traded at the end of Q2. We are confident that executing our strong patient playbook will allow us to drive sustained growth, accretive to our algorithm across the portfolio. With that, I will hand over to Luca for more details on our financials. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Dirk, and good afternoon. Our second quarter performance was once again strong with above expectations, outcomes across all P&L line cash. We delivered revenue growth of plus 19% with 5 points coming from volume mix, showing the term approach to supporting our brands and investing in capabilities exploit our long runway of opportunities is paying off. Emerging market to show significant strength, posting an increase of more than 22% with great momentum across all our major business units. Importantly, volume mix drove more than 10 points of this. Developed market grew plus 8.1% for the second quarter with trends in both and North America as demand trends well throughout the. Volume mix was also positive in developed market, with approximately 4 points of volume in Europe. While U.S are the most likely negative given supply chain constraints. You can see our portfolio performance on Slide 15. Chocolate and biscuits continue to exhibit strong and durability as making CapEx. Additionally, Gum & Candy continue to improve as global mobility increases coming out of the pandemic. Biscuits grew 10.4% for the quarter, with nearly 2 points coming from volume mix. Emerging markets grew strong double digits, while developed markets increased high single digits. -- delivered strong increases include Oreo, Chips Ahoy, redBus. Chocolate grew more than 30%, with increases in both developed and emerging markets including digit growth in Europe. Chocolate was driven by robust volume growth of plus 9% as consumers continue to our brands as an affordable indulgence, both global and local product well, including Cadbury Dairy Milk, overall lands. -- entendre nearly 26% and Mexico East North Africa all delivered strong growth. Now let's review our market share performance in 16. We had or in 55% revenue base during the first half with 20 points of headwind due to the service challenges in the U.S. We expect to see gradual improvement in the second half of the year. Our chocolate category performed well with 75% of our revenue base holding or gaining share. Our biscuits category had a gain share in 40% of our revenue, close 40 points of headwinds from supply chain constraints in North America. We are already seeing some improvements in service and share, but we expect this improvement visible as the year progresses. Now on Page 17, we delivered high single-digit growth, both in terms of gross and operating profits. Importantly, the overall gross profit dollars delivery allowed us to reinvest in A&C by double digits in the quarter and obtained EBIT gains versus last year. Turning to regional performance on Slide 18. Europe grew 10.8% during the quarter, supported by great execution and strong growth across mass grocery as well as convenience away from home and travel detailed channels. Results were driven by nearly 6% volume mix. While dollar for the quarter planned a little over 1% by significant commodity pressure as well as the impact of the Ukraine war. The implementation of pricing will allow us to return to profit growth. Importantly, we continue to invest in A&C. North America grew 9.2% in Q2, driven by higher pricing in biscuits as well as double-digit Gum & Candy growth. Volume mix was down 1% as a result of continued supply chain constraints. North America OI increased by 6.3% during the quarter due to higher in that was announced in early. AMEA grew 13.2% for the quarter, with strong volume mix growth of 8.7 points showing continued momentum in the period. India grew almost 30% in the quarter, driven by chocolate and biscuit. China increased high single digits despite restrictions in certain and Southeast Asia delivered single-digit growth with double-digit growth in its and chocolate. AMEA increased oil dollars by 7.9% for the quarter as volume-driven profit was partially offset by commodities, transportation inflation and reinvestment in A&C. Latin America grew 33%, with double-digit volume mix growth. Category strength was broad-based, small digit increases across the board. Brazil, Mexico and our Western Andean business unit all posted very strong double-digit increases similar to last quarter. A dollars in Latin America increased more than 70% for the quarter. These increases were driven by broad-based volume-driven effective pricing to our GMO actions and higher and candy sales. Now on Slide 19. Q2 EPS grew 9.1% at constant currency. This growth was high quality as it was primarily driven by top line related operating gains. On Page 20. We remain focused on driving attractive top and bottom line performance, including real dollar earnings growth. Clearly, this is a challenging year in terms of exceptional currency headwinds for us and for our industry. By executing against our strategy and focusing on what we can control, our performance over the past 3 years has been quite strong, both on an absolute and relative basis. These results are even more impressive if you consider we invested materially in our brands and capabilities. Going forward, we will continue to take actions to drive strong profit dollar growth in constant and real dollars. Turning to free cash flow and capital return on Slide 21. We delivered first half free cash flow of $1.6 billion during the first half as a result of our strong growth and profitability. We also returned $2.5 billion to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases over the same period. Our ongoing confidence in the business and cash generation enabled us to also announce a 10% increase to our cash dividend. Over the past 3 years, we have increased our dividend by more than 35%. Before I cover our outlook, I wanted to make a comment on our focus now and going forward as it relates to the current environment. We have and will continue to take action to navigate some of the near-term dynamics around the inflation and supply chain constraints. How we remain true to our strategy and making the right decisions to drive attractive, profitable and sustainable growth for the long term. That means we remain committed to significantly investing behind our brands, driving volumes, generating healthy profit dollar growth and improving our market share. We believe this disciplined approach will create lasting and differentiated value for our consumers, customers and shareholders. We also had a clear focus on strong earnings growth in constant real terms dollars. We have done this over the past 3 years despite a strong dollar. Although this year is shaping up to be more challenging, we believe we are well positioned to attract real dollar earnings in the years to come. Now let me provide some color on our revised 2022 outlook on Slide 24. Given our strong first half results, we now expect 8% plus top line growth. This revised top line outlook factors in a number of considerations, including the negative full year impact anticipated from the Ukraine war including revenue losses related to products that previously were manufactured in the country and exported into Europe. This can be quantified in approximately 1 percentage point of equivalent revenue growth. Second, some elements of customer disruption in Europe as a result of the second wave of price increases. While we have already been able to agree on most of the planned price increases in Europe, there are still some customers and countries where negotiations are underway. The size of customer disruption is difficult to predict, but we have factored into our guidance a certain impact, which is expected to be more pronounced in the third quarter. Finally, although elasticities have been at low levels to have, we are planning for them to return closer to historical levels in the second half as consumers continue to navigate inflationary trends and increased pricing across most markets. Our EPS outlook of mid- to high single digits is unchanged. And risk adjusted for additional inflation resulting from the Ukraine war, some customer disruption with respect to pricing and higher levels of elasticity. However, driven the strength of our first half results and depending on the outcome of our pricing negotiations in Europe, we might finish in the upper part of this range. As far as cost inflation goes, our expectations for low double-digit cost inflation for full year 2022 are confirmed. This earnings outlook also reflects $0.04 of EPS headwind from our stopped Ukraine operations. Additionally, this outlook reflects our ongoing commitment investing in our brands. in media, not only during this period of elevated pricing, but importantly, to drive long-term growth. Our EPS outlook also now factors in $0.22 of related to ForEx impact. $0.12 of this amount has already been included in our first results. With respect to free cash flow, our view is unchanged. We continue to expect $3 billion. With that, let's open the line for questions. Operator : . And our first question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : Two questions for me. The first one is just maybe, Dirk, if you could step back and just give us sort of the current state of things in the marketplace? And I guess in the context of having such a strong first half and maybe contemplating maybe some deceleration in the second half. Just where do things stand currently as you kind of look across your various markets? Dirk Van de Put : Yes, Bryan. Well, I would say, overall, we feel good about how '22 is panning out for us. As you can see from the presentation, the demand is strong. We have very good volume growth. Chocolate and biscuits are showing good growth. The categories are holding up. The emerging markets are a real growth engine for us and developed markets are solid with good volume in Europe. And so overall, year-to-date, our profit dollar growth is good, double-digit. And free cash flow is also strong. So I think the numbers of the first half are really good. If I then look to the second half, we feel good about the second half. If I go a little bit about what's going to happen here, I think we will see some softening of consumer confidence, particularly in developed markets, I would say. But I do expect our categories to remain solid, probably flat to small growth in volume. And then, of course, the effect of pricing. And I think within that, our brands are very strong and have a good connection to the consumer. We will have ongoing conversations with our customers about price increases, and we will try to drive a value equation there. I think together, we can probably find a way to keep our categories going at a very good rate and create the necessary value. I think competition will be about the same, maybe a difference between those that will invest and those that won't. And then from a pricing perspective, I can, of course, not comment on the specifics, but more pricing has to happen, and it's -- we execute very carefully by market. But it is something that still is in the pipeline. Most of it has been announced, and we're now in the discussions and implementation of it. Elasticity, as you saw, is slow, but we expect an uptick, and we've planned, in fact, for the second half of the year, normal elasticity that might pan out that way or not. At this moment, it would look, it wouldn't but we thought it would be a more careful planning stance. And then from a cost perspective, yes, some commodities are pulling back, but we do expect the near-term inflation to remain high. So I would say that our stance for the second half is positive but careful because we might see a more pronounced consumer reaction. We might have more difficulties getting pricing implemented. But overall, I think what's unique about us is that we are clearly in a virtuous cycle here. We are investing quite strongly, as you could see. That is leading to strong volume growth with some good pricing on top. Our gross profit growth is good, which allows us to make those investments. And then that is then leading to a good bottom line. We think that virtuous cycle will continue, but there might be here and there more difficulties than we've had in the first half. But overall, I think we feel very good about '22. Bryan Spillane : And if I could follow up on just specifically in Europe. In the prepared remarks you made, there were some comments about some caution around trying to push some price increases through. We know that there's -- we still have the conflict in the Ukraine and the impact on Russia. So maybe if you could talk a little bit about just -- is Europe kind of more of a concern area for you? And Luca, if you could add, the margins were pretty soft in Europe in the quarter. Is that something we expect over the back half of the year? Dirk Van de Put : Yes. Again, Europe, I'll comment first on what we see with our business in the consumer in Europe and then Luca can talk about the margins. I mean Europe was strong from a top line perspective. I'll hand it over to Luca for the margins afterwards. The business continues to perform well. Our core categories, our robust penetration is flat. We don't necessarily see consumers walking away from our categories or down trading so far. What we see is that consumers continue to prioritize grocery spending. They're spending less on other categories, but not on grocery. Private label is not particularly increasing. There is really little evidence that, that is happening. What we do see is that consumers are switching more to discounters. So that's a little bit the overall situation. So, so far, so good, I would say, nothing major happening from a consumer perspective. Going forward, yes, we are probably a little bit more concerned about Europe because we still have some pricing to implement of the second pricing round in Europe, about 65% is now agreed, still 35% under discussion. I think we will get there. But then the consumer will be confronted with that extra pricing, and we will see what the reaction is going to be there. So I would say we are feeling good so far, but we are -- of all the regions around the world, probably more concerned about what's going to happen in the second half in Europe. Luca? Luca Zaramella : Yes. So Bryan, a couple of things just to give you a little color. When actually I look at the GP dollar line for Europe, it goes up year-over-year even if marginally. But clearly, the material revenue and volume did translate proportionately into the appropriate gross margin. And that is because quite honestly, we have been a little bit delayed in terms of implementing pricing as compared to when commodity costs kicked in. So I want to reassure you that as we implement these pricing actions and you might still see margins under pressure in Q3 because of potential customer disruption. But as of -- as we look back and as these things will be behind us, margins in Europe will be restored. The other one that is important for us to notice is that A&C was up meaningfully in the quarter in Europe because obviously I have about price increases we want to keep consumer engaged. So the simple straight answer is yes, margin was pressured. As we implement pricing, the situation should get back to normal. And importantly, we continue investing, and that is one of the reasons why actually despite gross profit dollar being up year-on-year, OI margin -- OI dollars was down in the quarter. Operator : Our next question will come from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar : You raised your full year organic outlook -- growth outlook meaningfully but kept obviously the mid- to high single-digit constant currency EPS growth guidance. What would be preventing the top line strength from flowing through to profitability more significantly? Or is there perhaps an element of conservatism built in the model? It certainly seems that way from some of your previous comments, but I just want to make sure there's nothing else or discrete that's preventing that flow through that I'm not aware of. Luca Zaramella : Yes. No, I think it's a very good question. Thank you, Andrew. I'll give you a little bit of color around how the P&L came together in our mind in terms of giving you guidance. We continue and I personally continue to feel very confident about 2022 being a very strong year, and that is not only in terms of top line, but also in terms of bottom line and particularly cash flow. You might have noticed $1.6 billion in the first half. It is one of the strongest numbers we have ever posted, the strongest number.  Chocolate and biscuits, we are very happy. They are doing very well. I'm impressed with the volume mix that we saw in the first half. And as I said, while we kept on investing in the business, you see that our bottom line and cash flow continue to be strong. The 8% plus top line guidance reflects that confidence. And when you consider that it includes 1 point for the Ukraine prices, a potential and quite frankly as I said, difficult to estimate impact from customer reaction and as well as a more normal level of elasticities. You understand really that the business has an underlying momentum that is quite good, and we are confident in the combination of those trends.  On the profit side, look, I said it the last time we talked, I said we might be cautious and we continue to be cautious. But quite frankly, we are now in a much better position than we were in the last quarter to really see line of sight to high single-digit EPS at this point. I just wanted to be a little bit conservative because clearly, customer disruption is difficult to predict and then elasticities that are above what we see today can play a role as well. So I would like to say that in case of elasticities that are more benign and more benign customer reaction than the one we have planned certainly, we're going to be within the high single-digit limit. I also would like to make a point, which might be overlooking all these numbers is, and it is the fact that we continue to observe very good cost discipline in the company. You might be sidetracked by looking at the SG&A line being up year-on-year. But realities, overheads are held under control and the line that is increasing by more than 13% is our A&C support to the business. Andrew Lazar : Great. And then just briefly, Dirk, thanks for the details on Clif. Some investors certainly still question the greater foray into the bar category, and as recently announced with Clif is it's perceived as a fairly crowded space and one maybe where it can be tougher to sort of differentiate. I guess what underpins your confidence in being able to drive the profitability of that Clif business meaningfully over the next several years such that there is a compelling ROI on the transaction? Dirk Van de Put : Thanks, Andrew. Well, we believe that the category is interesting. And it had a slowdown as it relates to the COVID because it's very heavily linked to mobility, but clearly, the category is coming back in the recent months. And Clif, within that category is a very strong position. It's -- it has been for several years the fastest growing in that bar market. We would say that the brand is very strong from our perspective across all age groups. It has organic ingredients. It has a great taste. When we look at the details, we believe that there is a big opportunity to expand distribution in existing and alternative channels, but also improve the quality of the distribution of where Clif is present. We also think we can optimize A&C as well as their cost of goods and their SG&A. We also think that working with them, we can work on RGM and PPA and also make a difference there. We think the transaction price was a fair premium for a very scarce high-growth quality asset in North America. So we feel good about the value that we're getting there. I would say that the profitability of last year for Clif is not representative. As I said, we have a significant opportunity to optimize overheads, implement an RGM strategy, they've been experiencing supply chain disruption. And we're already seeing in the first 2 quarters of this year, a much improved profitability for the business. So we feel that the business is completely coming back to normal, and then we can add on the many synergies that we see from our side. So the earn-out is another factor probably that's important. We did see the possibility to add a significant earnout if we would go with a substantial top line acceleration and margin expansion. So we believe that as we would enter into that acceleration, our returns would even go up. And so we hope that we will see that sort of growth that we have been planning for. Operator : Our next question will come from Chris Growe with Stifel. Christopher Growe : I just had a question for you, if I could, on -- around this quarter with this accelerating rate of volume growth in relation to accelerating pricing, which is obviously very encouraging. I wonder if you could discuss that broadly and what you think drove that incremental volume as the pricing went higher. But then also with that stronger volume growth should come better fixed cost leverage and with the gross margin being down a little bit sequentially, I realize that pricing did not quite keep up with inflation. But just to understand how that fixed cost leveraging might have helped the gross margin in the quarter or may help it going forward? Luca Zaramella : Look, we are very happy with the volume growth and the revenue progression. There is an element of clearly some of the businesses that were impacted during COVID coming back. The reality is the underlying performance of both biscuits and chocolate is just great. I can't find another word really to qualify it. As you look at the profit, the volume leverage is in there. The point is, particularly in the case of Europe, as you look at the profitability number, there is a lag between commodities hitting the P&L and pricing being implemented. And you realize that maybe Europe, it is more challenging than in other places. In the rest of the world, we have been much more proactive in terms of pricing. But it is Europe really impacting the overall profitability of the company. Having said that, I still would like to get a couple of points out there. We clearly identified the watermark for our algorithm to work in terms of gross profit dollars to be 4% plus versus last year. I mean, this quarter, we are almost 10%. You look at the profit dollar growth, I think on a year-to-date, we are 11%. You look at the amount of A&C we have put into the P&L. As I said, it is double digit year-on-year. So when you step back, I think the question would be if we had priced earlier in Europe, how good of a P&L group we have, and it would be clearly much, much better. And that, I think, is what is going to happen going forward if we continue to invest in the business and execute pricing well because I think there is still, obviously, as we've said, a few situations where lies pricing needs to be implemented, particularly in Europe. Volume leverage is a critical component of the algorithm, and we will protect it as much as possible. And the benefit is going into the P&L. The point, as I said, if there is a lag between pricing and commodity going into the P&L of Europe. Christopher Growe : Okay. And just a quick follow-on. If I think about the second half outlook and a little more cautious view on margins, at least at this point as you've taken revenue up and kept EPS in place. Is the main item to watch here the consumers' reaction to the pricing? Is it elasticity we should be watching? Or is the volume performance? Or anything else that you would just note that we should watch as indicator for success for the second half of the year? Luca Zaramella : Look, the underlying margins is quite good. The inflationary pressure, I would say, is going a little bit up because obviously, in Q1, we had a more favorable pipeline of commodities. But besides elasticities, as I said, there is this element of what is the impact of customer disruption. And so that's where we wanted to give you the mid-single digit to high single-digit range as far as EPS goes. But look, as I said, even in presence of may be a customer disruption but with more benign elasticities than those that we have planned that are in line with historical norms, I think we still have a shot at getting to high single-digit EPS. Operator : Our next question comes from Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Alexia Howard : Can we ask to begin with, there wasn't much commentary in the prepared remarks about market share trends, which I know were very strong a couple of years ago and probably down year-on-year against some tough comps. But I wondered whether you could just make some commentary on that, particularly given what we're seeing in North America, where I think it's down, but maybe because of supply chain constraints. But I'd also be curious about market share trends in other parts of the world as well. And I have a quick follow-up after that. Dirk Van de Put : Yes, the answer is relatively straightforward apart from some nits here and there. The only area where our market share is down is in the U.S. And that is driven by the supply chain gradual recovery that we're having. If I look around the world in AMEA, we have very solid gains in China, in India, multi biscuits. We see also gum in China doing extremely well. Chocolate in South Africa is doing well. In Europe, we are gaining share, mainly driven by France biscuits and U.K. biscuits. Latin America is flat yesterday, but they had a major increase last year, but also their biscuits are gaining share. And the Easter period has been particularly strong for us. So we have gained significant share there. Was our strongest Easter ever. We will have some negative impact in Europe because we were exporting to the European market from our Ukraine factories. And so that will have an effect. We're working on alternative sourcing, but until the end of the year, we will have some disruption from that. Now if I look to the U.S. So the share that we're losing there is purely because of supply chain constraints and it's on 4 local brands : Nilla, Nutter Butter, Premium and belVita. Our supply chain service levels and the performance of our lines are gradually improving. And so we are expecting to see some share improvement in North America in the second half of the year. And overall, I would say, longer term, we feel very good about continued share gains because of the amount of brand investments we're doing, the ROI we're getting on those. We are also driving share because of distribution gains in places like China, India, Southeast Asia, and we also have good gains coming from our innovation. So if you would be able to discard the U.S. situation, I think you would be able to see a very good situation in the rest of the world. Alexia Howard : Great. And just a quick follow-up. Have you just closed how you're planning to finance the Clif Bar acquisition, whether that's out of debt, cash on hand or any other measures? Luca Zaramella : Yes. We have released, I think, a couple of weeks back an 8-K where we have secured a little bit of additional term loan. And clearly, that has to function as a bridge to the divestiture of gumin developed market and holds worldwide to be able to deploy those funds for the acquisition of Clif. So that's the idea, and it applies the same to Ricolino. Now there are still other things that might be in play. As you know, we have multiple levels of flexibility within the balance sheet with coffee, with divestitures, et cetera. I think at this point in time, though, I still believe that the $2 billion of share buybacks is secured for the year. So I'm not sure we will go there to fund the acquisitions. Operator : Our next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. David Palmer : On Europe, you mentioned that organic sales and volume trends are remaining strong, and you showed that pretty lousy consumer confidence numbers over there, though. And so it does seem to be maybe even more than the U.S. a period of some data looking worse than others. But are you seeing any countries or categories where price elasticity is picking up and you're seeing some trade down? And is that in any part some of the resistance you're picking up from retailer customers on the latest round of price increases? Dirk Van de Put : Well, first, I would say that our categories, biscuits and chocolates are normally quite resilient in these circumstances. We've seen it during COVID, but we have also seen it in 2008 and in previous recessions because it's a small indulgence that consumers find difficult to forget or to leave behind. And then the presence of private label is relatively limited in our categories. So that might be -- at the start of it, that might be one of the reasons why our categories and our performance continues to look fairly strong. If you then look at consumer confidence, I think we do see a softening and consumers clearly talk about the inflation, the interest rates, the threat of recession. We don't see that in emerging markets, but the question, of course, was about developed. There is no drag on volumes yet. But if you go around the markets in Europe, things are different sometimes. So you, for instance, see a very strong French biscuit market, but you see chocolate in Germany and U.K. affected. And sometimes it has to see with seasonality and things like that and COVID with last year. But overall, I would say, from the consumer consumption perspective, it's a mixed bag. But overall, it remains relatively mitigated the effect. The elasticities are slightly up versus Q1, but they are still below the historical benchmark. We do expect higher levels, as I explained in years ago, but it's still nothing that is as high as it used to be before. So for instance, if I look at U.K. chocolate, that's probably where we see the highest elasticity so far. But it's declining the elasticity, and we are now about 10% below the '20 or '21 levels as it relates to elasticity. Now again, we have to see higher price increases in Europe for the second half. So we will see what happens there. But so far, there is really nothing from a penetration standpoint, from switching to private label, getting out of the category. We don't see anything that is of a major concern, but that doesn't mean it's going to remain like that. David Palmer : And you mentioned A&C increasing double digits so far this year. Where are you most leaning in with that spend? Dirk Van de Put : Well, the one region where we are not spending more than last year is in North America so far because of our supply chain disruption, and it didn't make sense. We first have to improve our customer service. But then in the rest of the world, I would say it's about equally split. There are some markets where we particularly want to focus on the growth that we see ahead of us. So there's a slight disruption here and there for higher investment. But overall, I would say it's across the board that we are investing in biscuits and chocolates, mainly. Operator : Our last question will come from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Dirk, I believe it was you in prepared comments or maybe it was a response to question, I forget. But you referenced an outlook for your categories to kind of maintain maybe flat, modest volume growth and then price on top of it through the back half of the year. Your guidance implies that you expect your own volume to be down sort of low to mid-single digits in the back half. And I was hoping you could unpack that for us. Like are there specific things that you're aware of or that we should be aware of that will be headwinds or is gas to pile on the notion of conservatism, are you just sort of prudently assuming that things get worse because the environment is really choppy? Luca Zaramella : Jason, maybe Dirk will comment on the category themselves. In terms of the guidance, as I said, when you strip out the impact of the Ukrainian war, which is 1 point that it is more pronounced in the second half. When you strip out the higher elasticities, we are planning or which arguably might be on the cautious side. And third, when you strip out the impact of the customer disruption pretty much the underlying trends of the first half are the same as of the second half. So I want to reassure you that in terms of slowdown, as you look at some of the numbers for chocolate and biscuits, as you look at emerging markets growing in the quarter, 22%, we are not assuming a material slowdown into the second part of the year. It is these 3 elements that I spend out in the prepared remarks and also in some of the answers I gave that impact the rest of the year. Look, the 8 plus, the plus is there for one reason, which is I would might end up doing better than that. And I believe it's there. Dirk Van de Put : Yes. From the category perspective, it was correct, what you was saying we thought that -- what we expect to see is relatively high pricing for probably in the 8% to 10% range, maybe even double-digit pricing. And that would be accompanied by flat to maybe a 1% volume growth. Now you have to keep into account that in previous years, the category growth was around -- in volume, was around 2%. And then and on top another 2% of pricing in the past. So we would not be that far away from the volume growth that we've been seeing in the past, maybe slightly down. So that's our estimate for the time being for the second half. Operator : I would now like to turn the call back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Dirk Van de Put : Well, thank you. Happy to have been able to inform you about a great first half of the year. Obviously, more to come, but thank you for your interest in the company and looking forward to talk to you in the coming weeks. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, everyone. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's call, and we appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

Today, Dirk will provide a business and strategy update, then Luca will review our financial results and outlook. We will close with Q&A. I'll now turn the call over to Dirk. Dirk Van de Put : Thanks, Shep, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. I will start on Slide 4. I am pleased to share that we delivered another robust quarter with high quality top line growth continued strength in both developed and emerging markets and strong profit dollar growth. This execution, combined with continued acceleration of our strategic initiatives, supports raising our full year revenue growth and adjusted EPS outlook. Reinvesting in our business is one of the best ways we can deploy capital. And I'm happy to say that we continue to increase investments in our brands and capabilities that should reinforce and build upon our strong foundation. We also continue to make great progress in reshaping our portfolio with the full integration of our Chipita business as well as the closing of our acquisitions of Clif Bar and Ricolino. We remain confident that the strength of our brands and our proven strategy position us well to deliver attractive, sustainable growth for the remainder of 2022 and beyond. Above all, we remain extremely confident in our people who remain relentlessly focused on delivering the right snacks for the right moment made the right way to consumers around the world. Turning to Slide 5. You can see that our strategy is continuing to drive a virtuous cycle. We are well positioned to deliver a strong full year '22 performance and long-term revenue growth. This quarter, our revenue growth was 12.1%, which means 11.2% growth year-to-date. The revenue was generated through continued volume growth as well as strong pricing necessary because of ongoing cost inflation, and it demonstrates the resilient demand for our brands. That revenue growth is fueling our gross profit, which is growing 12.8% for the quarter and 10.8% year-to-date. This very strong gross profit growth is allowing us to increase our A&C investments high single digit, which in turn will help us to continue to drive sustainable top line and repeating the virtuous cycle. The strong gross profit growth also generated, after investments, operating income growth of 9.6% for the quarter and 10.6% year-to-date while delivering great free cash flow results. As you can see on Slide 6, we delivered 12.1% organic net revenue growth in Q3. Volume remained solid relative to much of the sectors as consumers continue to choose our trusted and beloved brands even as we implement necessary pricing. We view our performance in the third quarter and year-to-date as further evidence that our long-term strategy continues to pay off. Since the launch of our new growth plan in 2018, we have consistently over-delivered on net revenue growth through a virtuous cycle of increasing investment, strong local execution and targeted incentives. We remain confident that this strategy will continue to deliver attractive growth in the quarters and years to come. Like many companies, as shown on Slide 7, we continue to navigate through a dynamic operating environment, driven by cost inflation, the energy crisis in Europe and supply chain volatility.  Let's take a closer look at each of these dynamics and the steps we are taking to address them. First, we continue to face elevated input cost inflation, especially in the areas of energy, transportation, packaging, wheat, dairy and edible oils. To offset these challenges, we have implemented appropriate price increases across key markets, including Europe. Additionally, we have announced further pricing actions across numerous markets across the globe, including the United States, which takes effect in December '22, and we are preparing for '23 negotiations in other markets. We also continue to take appropriate action to hedge our commodity costs with greater flexibility while continuing to advance our ongoing productivity initiatives. Second, in terms of energy inflation and continuity, we remain focused on risk management tools and alternative sources to help mitigate the impact.  And third, we continue to manage through volatility in the supply chain, especially in the U.S. due to labor shortages at third party as well as a continuing shortage of trucking capacity and containers. We are prioritizing key SKUs to protect share and continue to make progress in improving manufacturing and warehouse capacity. Turning to our categories and the consumer on Page 8. Our latest research shows that snacking continues to play a central role in consumers' lives. And as a result, our core categories of chocolate and biscuits remain resilient. Consumers in developed markets continue to prioritize groceries over other forms of spending, and they continue to view our brands as affordable indulgences. Meanwhile, in emerging markets, consumer confidence remains strong with growing demand for our categories and continued loyalty to our iconic brands. Because of this enduring brand loyalty, private label share is either flat or down in the vast majority of our markets. Shoppers continue to say they are much less likely to switch to private label in chocolate and biscuits compared to other categories. With the return to school, we are seeing growth in products popular for school lunches like biscuit multipacks here in the U.S. We're also seeing continued growth in chocolate bars, treat sizes, gifting and seasonal shapes in Europe. Looking forward to the Christmas season, the majority of European consumers say they plan to spend the same amount over the holidays, if not more, as in 2021. They also say they plan to spend more money at home and on gifting with less money spent on dining out and entertainment. These category dynamics combined with the enduring strength of our trusted and beloved brands give us confidence that we will continue to successfully navigate inflationary periods like today. Moving to our efforts around portfolio reshaping on Slide 9. I'm pleased to share that we are continuing to advance our strategy of strengthening our leadership in core categories through our acquisition and divestment approach complemented by strong integration playbook. Over the summer, we completed the integration of Chipita, a high-growth European leader in packaged croissants and baked snacks. Chipita provides us an important platform to further accelerate growth in the attractive biscuits and baked snacks category. More recently, we closed our acquisition of Clif Bar & Company, expanding our global snack bar business to more than $1 billion, anchored by the marquee brand widely loved for taste and sustainability. This business is up low double digits on a year-to-date basis and we are excited to take this great brand to the next level. And just today, we closed our acquisition of Ricolino, Mexico's leading confectionary company, doubling the size of our business and more than tripling our routes to market in the high-priority Mexican market. These are just the latest steps in our ongoing commitment to accelerate focus on our core categories, filling geographical white spaces, expanding our presence in high-growth channels and growing our presence in key segments and price tiers. We're confident that this focus will allow us to drive sustained growth accretive to our algorithm across the portfolio. As we continue to accelerate our focus on growth, we remain committed to doing our part to drive positive change at scale. At our investor update earlier this year, we announced that we have elevated sustainability to become the fourth pillar of our company's long-term growth strategy. Within this framework, you can see on Slide 10 that we recently launched the next chapter of Cocoa Life, our signature cocoa sourcing program. Cocoa Life already has delivered strong results. Over the past decade, farmer net incomes have increased about 15% in Ghana and about 33% in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. Children are better protected with more robust monitoring and remediation system, and we're helping to prevent deforestation by educating farmers about optimal farming practices. But cocoa farmers and their communities still face big systemic challenges. That's why we're investing another $600 million, bringing our total investments to $1 billion with an aim to source 100% of our cocoa volume through Cocoa Life farmers by 2030. While we are excited about the promise of these investments, we continue to call for more collaborative efforts and collective actions to drive greater impact, including new private-public collaborations. We are proud of our leadership in helping to make cocoa right, and we'll keep you updated on our progress. Finally, before I hand over to Luca for more details on our financials, I would like to make -- sorry, to take a moment to share some updates to our leadership team. First, I would like to congratulate Sandra MacQuillan, our Chief Supply Chain Officer, on her well-deserved retirement. Since joining Mondel\u0113z in 2019, Sandra has brought focus and clarity to our supply chain organization, with a people-first leadership style and an unrelenting commitment to doing it right from shelf to field. We thank her for her tremendous contributions. Frank Cervi has assumed the role of Chief Supply Chain Operations Officer, reporting directly to me. Frank is a proven leader, bringing more than 30 years of global supply chain experience to the table. He has a strong drive for executional excellence, tackling big challenges and pursuing continuous improvement. His recent roles within Mondel\u0113z, including, most recently, leading supply chain strategy, position him well for continued success. Additionally, after a successful 34-year career in research and development, Rob Hargrove, our Chief R&D Officer, will be retiring January 2023. During his tenure with Mondel\u0113z, Rob successfully transformed the R&D function from a complex blend of category and geographic activities to a well-connected, technically rigorous global community. We thank him for his many years of dedication and accomplishments. With Rob's retirement, we welcome Daniel Ramos as our new Chief Research and Development Officer, reporting directly to me effective November 8. Daniel is a seasoned global executive with more than 25 years of R&D and consumer-centric innovation expertise. He joins us from The Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies where he had a strong focus on advancing sustainable packaging initiatives. One final piece of leadership news, Javier Polit, our Chief Digital and Information Officer, is now serving on our Mondel\u0113z leadership team, providing enhanced strategic oversight as we advance our commitment to becoming the digital snacks leaders. Since joining the company almost three years ago, Javier has elevated our technology initiatives and infrastructure at both the global and business unit levels. Javier will continue to report to Luca.  With that, I will hand over to Luca for more details on our financials. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Dirk, and good afternoon, everyone. Our third quarter results were strong from volume, revenue, profit dollar growth to cash flow generation. In addition, growth was broad-based across categories and brands. We delivered revenue growth of more than 12% with 1 point of growth driven by volume/mix. Emerging markets were a clear highlight for the quarter with broad-based trends on both top and bottom lines. Emerging markets net revenue grew more than 24% in the quarter, with 8 points of that growth coming from volume/mix. Developed markets grew 5.2%. Volume/mix was down 3 points, entirely as a result of customer disruptions in Europe related to pricing negotiation, nearly all of which has since been resolved. Turning to portfolio performance on Slide 13. Our chocolate and biscuit franchises continue to demonstrate their resilience and deliver strong results while ongoing improvements in mobility helped fuel robust gum and candy performance. Biscuits grew 11.5% for the quarter, with nearly 1 point coming from volume, albeit mix was negative as we suffered from customer disruption in Europe. Emerging markets again grew strong double digit, while developed markets increased high single digit. Oreo, Chips Ahoy!, Ritz, Triscuit and Club Social were among brands that deliver outstanding growth. Chocolate grew more than 9%, of which 1.3 points were driven by volume/mix, with increases in both emerging and developed markets. Emerging markets posted exceptional growth of strong double digit. Cadbury Dairy Milk, Toblerone, Lacta and Bis all grew double digits. Gum & Candy grew more than 22%. Brazil, Mexico, Western India and Middle East, North Africa, all performed very well. Now let's review our market share performance on Slide 14. We held or gained share in 45% of our revenue base, which includes 20 points of headwind coming from U.S. supply chain constraints. We are seeing gradual improvements in share and service levels as we closed the quarter and early into the fourth quarter. And in fact, share in the U.S. should turn positive for the last few readings of the year, and we should enter next year with a favorable trajectory. Chocolate performed well with 65% of our revenue base holding or gaining share. This number is still reflective of our good execution in the category and our ongoing investment, but some headwinds are expected, given the customer disruption in Europe. Our biscuit business held or gained share in 35% of our revenue base. This includes 35 points of headwinds from the U.S. supply chain. Now turning to Page 15. In Q3, we posted gross profit dollar growth of plus 13% and plus 10% for EBIT. Year-to-date, we have delivered nearly $900 million in absolute gross profit dollar growth, a record high for our business. This dollar growth enables us to continue investing in brand-building to drive our virtuous cycle of growth. Although organic top line and profit dollar growth are key focus areas, cost excellence remains an important part of our DNA and an enabler in this environment. To that end, we continue to make good progress around digitizing the enterprise and realizing efficiencies, reducing nonessential overhead spend and driving simplification. Turning to regional performance on Slide 16. Europe grew 5.2% during the quarter. This includes nearly 5 points of volume/mix decline entirely linked to customer disruptions from a round of pricing negotiations during Q3. Importantly, as I already said, we have successfully implemented virtually all of the price planned. We continue to support our brands with meaningful investments in the region to ensure consumers stay loyal to our categories and franchises. OI dollar for the quarter declined by 7.4%, driven by customer volume disruption and ongoing commodity pressure. Now that pricing has been implemented, we expect margin recovery for Europe in Q4. North America grew 12% in Q3, driven by higher pricing in biscuits, strong candy growth and robust increases from our ventures businesses, particularly Tate's and Give & Go. Volume/mix was roughly flat. North America OI increased by more than 20% during the quarter due to higher pricing that was implemented in Q2 as well as some benefits related to the factory closings last year and the addition of Clif. AMEA grew 14.6% for the quarter with strong volume/mix growth of 8.5 points and broad-based growth across all of our business units in the region. India grew strong double digit for the quarter, driven by both chocolate and biscuits. China increased high single digits despite COVID restrictions in certain cities, while Southeast Asia delivered robust double-digit growth across all snacking categories and Australia grew mid-single digit. AMEA increased OI dollars by 17.2% for the quarter as volume leverage and pricing were partially offset by commodity and transportation inflation. Latin America grew 31.6% with mid-single-digit volume/mix growth. Similar to Q2, this trend was extensive with double-digit increases across every single category. Brazil, Mexico, Western India business unit all posted double-digit increases for the quarter. OI dollars in Latin America grew nearly 50% for the quarter. This increase was driven by broad-based volume growth, pricing and ongoing improvements from the Gum & Candy categories. Next to EPS on Slide 17. Q3 EPS grew 15.7% at constant currency. This growth was primarily driven by operating gains. And despite significant currency headwinds, we grew reported dollars by nearly 6% in the quarter and 4% on a year-to-date basis. Turning to Slide 18. We remain focused on generating strong free cash flow. Year-to-date, we have generated $1.9 billion, including a onetime expense of $300 million related to the Clif acquisition and buyout of the non-vested employee stock ownership plan. This was part of the originally disclosed purchase price, but as it relates to the ease for employees and deemed compensation, it is reflected in cash flow. This strong free cash flow performance has enabled us to return $3.3 billion to shareholders year-to-date through share repurchases and dividends. Turning to our outlook on Page 20. We continue to see positive momentum in the business as a result of our strong position within attractive categories, significant brand support and consistent execution. For the time being, our categories are resilient and continue to see lower elasticities than historical levels. Given the strength of our performance through the first 3 quarters, the successful implementation of pricing in Europe and the overall health of demand trends in our business, we now expect, for the full year : organic net revenue to grow 10%-plus versus our prior outlook of 8%-plus; adjusted EPS to increase 10%-plus versus our previous outlook of mid- to high single digit; and free cash flow of $3 billion-plus, which includes the $300 million of expenses related to the Clif ease-up, which would indicate stronger underlying results. We continue to expect broad-based growth in our core categories and markets. We also expect a significant contribution from pricing, and we continue to plan for double-digit cost inflation. We have just announced another round of pricing in the U.S. to reflect continued inflation and positive impact of our commodities coverage in 2022 seizing current spot levels in 2023. While we successfully concluded our European pricing with disruption below our anticipated levels, inflation continues to be a concern in Europe, particularly with energy, that despite some EU-driven measures is still a significant headwind. Energies has broad repercussions, both on pack cost and other raw materials. We expect another round of pricing in Europe as we enter next year.  Our EPS outlook also now factors in $0.26 of headwinds related to ForEx impact. $0.19 of this amount have already been included in our first three quarters. At current ForEx levels and outlook, EPS in reported dollars would be positive year-on-year, which shows the resilience of our business.  With that, let's open it up for questions. Shep Dunlap : Operator, we're ready for the first question. Luca Zaramella : Operator? Operator : Our first question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : All right. Great. Maybe just to start off, Dirk, we've -- obviously, there's been a lot of questions in our world around just current events, current affairs. So could you just give us maybe a little bit of a -- as-you-see-it-now kind of the state of the union in some of your key markets and just how the consumer is holding up and just how all these macro pressures may or may not be affecting the markets as you see it now? Dirk Van de Put : Yes, yes. Thank you, Bryan. Well, first, on the results, I would say we have a very strong top line performance, which I think is a testimony to the resilience of our categories, which is important to take into account. We see signs that consumers really want to continue to consume chocolate and biscuits. I think our pricing execution is now really coming through. And on top of all that, we have volume growth, which is quite unique in today's world. Obviously, you've seen that the emerging markets are a highlight in Q3 but also year-to-date with a broad-based strength from China to India to Brazil. We're doing well in all of our emerging markets. Our margins are a little bit impacted by customer disruptions in Europe. Sales in Europe overall were good, but there was some customer disruption so sales could have been better, and that also has affected our margins a little bit. And then our profit, our bottom line is ahead of algorithm and could have been better without that European impact. So we're increasing our view on what the year will look like from a top line and a bottom line perspective. Now particularly that our pricing in Europe is complete and behind us. And so yes, FX is impacting our EPS but we are still showing real growth in -- or growth in real dollars. So overall, I would say the results are good. So if you look a little bit beyond that, what does that mean? From a consumer perspective in the first place, we see in emerging markets consumer sentiment being very solid, very positive. I'm talking about Southeast Asia, India, China even. And so there is a certain optimism. And the degree of strength in the consumer confidence in emerging markets for us is almost to pre-COVID level. Of course, developed markets, we see a very mixed picture, challenged in Europe, as we all know, relatively optimistic in the U.S. In the middle of all that, as I already said, our categories, we expect to continue a strong buy. We see more and more signs that consumers continue to see or increasingly see our categories as an affordable indulgence. We see consumers saying that chocolate is really something they cannot live without. And so we believe that the spending decrease that we will see from consumers eventually, as inflation keeps hitting them, is going to be probably more in the big ticket items. Grocery seems to be doing overall pretty well, I would say. I think we also are benefiting from the fact that we have strong brands in which we continue to invest quite significantly. That's part of our thinking, and I think that is helping us in our results. Pricing, of course, played a role. On pricing, where we stand is that we've just gone through our second round of pricing this year in Europe. We've announced a third round of pricing in the U.S., which will take effect in December. And we are starting our negotiations in Europe for the typical beginning of the year 2023 pricing round. As it relates to Latin America and AMEA, the pricing that we implement is more fragmented, but in most cases, we're also in our third pricing round. And so far, it looks like that will go well, this new pricing round. Of course, we have to see what happens in Europe, where we expect more customer disruption in the beginning of the year as we announce the pricing. From an elasticity perspective, maybe I would say that, that remains below expectations. It is lower than it was last year even, certainly lower than it was pre COVID. In our forecast, we are foreseeing higher elasticity effects because we believe that eventually, there will be a bigger effect, but so far, we're not quite seeing that. And then from a cost perspective, we've seen some commodities showing signs of pulling back but we still expect significant inflation in '23 and hence, the pricing rounds we have to go through. I think we're very well positioned for '23. We have to continue to price in light of the inflation. We will increase our focus on RGM, revenue growth management. And we continue to invest to drive volume growth and, of course, net revenue growth. And I think as I said before, we will see some volatility in Q1 in Europe as we implement pricing. I can go maybe a little bit deeper because I know that it's on everybody's mind as it relates to the European consumer and what are we seeing there, might be useful to do so. What we see is that they continue to prioritize grocery spending. They seem to be choosing that instead of spending on other discretionary items. So we see a clear decrease in entertainment and leisure, in travel, in restaurants, in eating out, in clothing, personal care, household goods. That's where we see the decreases in Europe but not in food and not in our categories. So the consumer is also relatively positive, we see, in Europe. They're very aware of the current situation. 80% express is concerned with the current situation and they all understand that things are going to be rough. But 60%, for instance, of consumers in the UK or Germany believe that six months down the road, their situation will be better. And in France, that sentiment is even higher, which is understandable because there the energy price effect is lower for them. Chocolate is highly desired. We see more and more signs that consumers are saying it's the snack they cannot live without. And so I would say, concern, short term from consumers, relatively optimistic and they keep on buying our categories, which is reflected in the numbers that you saw, which includes, as I said before, some client disruption.  I hope this gives you an idea, Bryan. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And next, we move to the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. My apologies, Andrew. If you could resignal, we'll move next to Ken with JPMorgan. Ken Goldman : I recognize it's too early to discuss next year in full and I wouldn't anticipate any specific numbers. But I think a lot of people are looking at maybe some tailwinds and headwinds in a broad sense. And I was hoping to kind of review some of these and see if I'm missing anything big. So on the tailwind side, you'll have wraparound pricing plus new pricing. You should have good organic volumes still on underlying demand. You'll have strong advertising again. Maybe the same dollar inflation but it will be less on a percent basis. And then you'll have the top line benefits from acquisitions, right? And then in terms of headwinds, maybe a little bit less pricing than '22, still some macro uncertainty in Europe and Asia, still some new regulations in the UK. you have to wade through. And then, of course, you'll have FX, higher interest expense and lower pension income. So I know I'm running through all these pretty quickly. I don't mean to put you on the spot, but does anything kind of stand out that's major that I'm missing or getting incorrect in that kind of quick list there? Luca Zaramella : Yes. Maybe I think the only 1 thing I would add to that equation, Ken, is the synergy that will come to fruition through the acquisitions of Chipita, Ricolino and Clif. And those are not only revenue synergies, as you mentioned, they are also cost synergies and better bottom line. I think in general, the way we think at this point about 2023, it is that consumer demand fundamentals are still strong, and we believe we are in a good place in terms of revenue and demand for next year. As we've just said, we compete in resilient categories. And we have created strong loyalty through the investments we have been making in our brands. I think importantly, as you dissect the regions, emerging markets are doing very well. I think looking at the revenue number, 34%-plus, 8% volume growth in the quarter, it is simply amazing. And it is important to say here that particularly on this, we still have quite a bit of headroom in terms of distribution penetration of our categories and not to mention the value of categories like cakes and pastries and et cetera. I think in terms of the U.S., it is on a good trajectory. I mentioned a little bit the share trajectory that we see going into next year. And as we said, we are about to implement another round of pricing. I think the question mark is a little bit Europe but pricing there is inevitable. We'll see what happens with customers in Q1. But importantly, we have been investing in brands there as well. We have been creating bonds with consumers. And as we said, I think we believe our categories are still a necessity these tough times. So all in all, I think we are going to have an algorithm year, but let's stay tuned because quite frankly, it is a little bit premature at this point in time to give you guidance for 2023. Operator : Next, we can go to the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Maybe to start off, just picking up on the emerging market commentary. Obviously, the results there remain really standout and probably better than many had surmised or forecast, given how volatile some of these markets can be. Maybe you can just get into a little bit more detail on just a couple of the key largest emerging markets and kind of how you're thinking about how those look as you go forward and what you're sort of building into the forecast? And then I've just got a quick follow-up. Luca Zaramella : Yes, maybe I'll take that and Dirk can also chime in here. Look, reality is we are very pleased with emerging market performance. And I think it has been quite strong all around. When we look a little bit beyond the last three quarters, I would say that all emerging markets pretty much bounced back very well from pre COVID and -- or for COVID. And I think the performance versus pre-2020 has accelerated in those markets. We have been consistently investing and that is paying off. We are not privy to all the P&Ls for emerging markets, but what I can tell you is that they are delivering reported dollar top line growth. They are delivering top and bottom line dollar growth, and importantly, generating quite a bit of cash flow for us. So I think from a return of capital is really something that is remarkable. We still have huge headrooms, I believe, with brands like Oreo, Milka, Cadbury, et cetera. And I believe we will be -- we will continue to be positively surprised by this market also going forward. Look, beyond the usual suspects like India, China, et cetera, and those are markets that continue to do very, very well, we are particularly pleased with markets like Southeast Asia at this point in time. We are particularly pleased with markets like Brazil. We continue to do very, very well and generate solid top and bottom line in those markets. I think WACAM, which is Western Andean region bouncing back from pre COVID, particularly through Gum & Candy. But importantly, the light motive of all these markets is the performance of Oreo, which is just amazing. So I think all in all, I would say I can't call out one specific market here. It is pretty much all of them doing quite well. Andrew Lazar : And then you've talked about a lot of the -- some of the incremental pricing moves, right, that you've made or are in the process of making to try and better position yourself for what's coming next year. Would we anticipate at this point being in a point to enter the year where you would have all of what you need in place such that there wouldn't be as much of, let's say, a lag to start the new year? Or should we brace ourselves maybe for the sort of consistent lag of getting incremental pricing in before you really fully catch up again to the type of cost inflation that you're looking for next year? Luca Zaramella : Look, reality is pricing for more than half -- more than 50%, has already been taken or announced. And so as a matter of pricing for next year, you have to think about carryover of announced pricing being for more than 50% done. Obviously, as we said, there is the U.S. coming as of December, and that will add to the 50%. I think in general, your assumption is absolutely correct. The only 1 distinction I would make is Europe. And Europe, I think, will have a little bit of a lag compared to the necessity of pricing because particularly, energy costs are a reality right now. And so you're going to see some margin pressure potentially in Europe in Q1 and potential customer disruption will compound on that. I think for the rest, you are correct. Operator : Next, we go to the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow : I was hoping you could give a little more color into the logics for this third round of price increase in the U.S. Are you taking it because you have commodity hedges that are rolling over and can no longer protect your costs? Are you taking it because packaging costs are rising higher? Could you be more specific as to that? And then also, are you also trying to price through some of the knock-on elements of inflation, like labor or energy? Or does the logic still just focus on the kind of components of the product? Dirk Van de Put : Your assumption is right. It's a combination of everything you said. So our approach to pricing is that the additional costs we see every year, which could be from a commodity perspective, packaging, labor, transportation, we are trying to price away. So we do have a number of hedges that are coming off. We are careful on the hedging for next year because it could, to our opinion, go both ways. Prices could -- or cost could still go up. We want to hedge the right way against that, but we also need to be careful that commodity costs don't come down and that we can benefit from that. And so the short answer to what you said, it's all of the above. The good news about the third round of pricing in the U.S. is that it's been announced and it's been accepted by the clients. We will see how the consumer reacts, but so far, the two previous price increases, we have not seen a major impact on consumer offtake and penetration and frequency, volume growth and so on is all still very strong. So we have good confidence that this price increase will go through. And then we should be okay unless something happens in our cost picture. Operator : Next, we go to Chris Growe with Stifel. Chris Growe : I just had a couple of questions for you. The first one would just be that you've given some commentary around, obviously, some more pricing in North America. It sounds like a little better volume performance in Europe. I just wanted to understand around those factors and perhaps as others to consider. Would you... Dirk Van de Put : Hello? Operator : Mr. Dickerson. My apologies. Next, we move to Mr. Dickerson with Jefferies. Robert Dickerson : Maybe just kind of a broader question for you, Dirk, around A&C. Obviously, we keep hearing a lot of people think promotional activities going need to increase because you see still increase, but I've heard a lot of C-level managers from food companies, CPG companies say actually now price as well as elasticity stays benign, don't need to increase promotional side while at the same time on a low basis as we saw in Q3. You obviously continue to really invest behind your brands. So I guess kind of quick, almost two-part question. One is just kind of what's the current perspective on kind of go-forward promotional needs with the competitive backdrop? And then two, should we be thinking as we go forward, let's say, even two years or three years that of that rate of that year-over-year A&C spend could kind of mimic the rate of the year-over-year revenue growth spend as you may have some needs, especially with some of the recent acquisitions? Or is there operational leverage that could come out of that? That's it. Dirk Van de Put : Yes. Well, I would say that in the current environment where we have to increase our prices quite substantially, it is important for us to keep on increasing our A&C spending because we need to make sure that the consumer has trust in our brands and really want to consume them. And we can clearly see the effects of this year after year increasing in our spending. We can now see -- although overall, there's not that much movement into private label, in the market where there is a little bit of movement in private label, it's not so much coming from our brand. And I think that is a reflection from the spending that we've had. Going forward, particularly since we're seeing an acceleration in our top line, particularly since we're seeing our volume working for us, I would say we don't really anticipate that we're going to change that formula. You know the way we think about this. We grow our gross profit at an X percentage. But this quarter is quite strong, I would say. And we then want to flow half of that back into investing in the business and half of that in the bottom line. I don't think that will necessarily change. It's working for us and the business is accelerating. As it relates to the acquisitions, obviously, we have foreseen, in some of the acquisitions, a significant investment because we do have cost synergies, which as Luca said, will start to show up next year in our results. But we also have top line synergies. And we feel that some of the brands have quite good potential, but they might need some investments. So we're going to use the same formula as it relates to acquisitions as we are using on the rest of the business. Will, over time, we do a constant measurement, which is about advertising sufficiency? That still shows that increasing our advertising will lead to increased volume, will lead to increased net revenue growth. And so as long as we can confirm that picture, we feel that this is the right track for us. As soon as we would see that, that is not the case anymore. Obviously, we would not keep on increasing our A&C. But at this stage, I think it's working. We don't see a reason to change it. Operator : We return to the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Chris Growe : Okay. You got me now. Yes, if you didn't like that question, you didn't have to cut me off. I'm only kidding. So I was just going to ask about the gross margin and just to understand with more price -- with pricing -- more pricing coming in North America, it sounds like a little better volume performance in Europe. Should we expect a better balance of pricing and cost inflation in the fourth quarter and therefore, some sequential gross margin improvement? Luca Zaramella : Look, I think as a matter of fact, we don't give much guidance around gross margin. But the way you have to think about it is there is gross profit growth in terms of dollars that we commit to and that we are going to deliver. As you think about gross margin percentage, I think particularly, the U.S., Latin America and AMEA are on, I believe, a solid ground. Obviously, in Europe, you're going to see the benefit of pricing but do not necessarily neglect the fact that particularly around energy, there is more costs coming our way. Now for the year, we are 100% covered in terms of commodities and ForEx, so we have visibility. I think you're still going to see a little bit of margin pressure in Q4. But importantly, you're going to see strong dollar growth, and you're going to see that flowing partly to the bottom line. We will continue to invest. And as I said, as you think about particularly Chipita and if you think about Clif, there will be some synergies coming our way. Chris Growe : Okay. And just one other question on -- there was a comment about mix being a bit of a drag. I just want to understand, is that geographic mix? Or is that something you're seeing in terms of your product assortment, your SKUs? Any kind of trade down or smaller pack sizes, that kind of thing? Luca Zaramella : No, I don't think that it is anything concerning. What I said as it relates to biscuits is that volume was up but volume/mix was partially down. And the reason for that is that mix in Europe because of customer disruption caused a little bit of the problem. So there were product lines, particularly in France and other places, that are more profitable than others around the world, and those were mostly impacted by customer disruption. We have also to realize that customer disruption in terms of margins is a little bit higher because obviously, we still have fixed costs. And so the marginal contribution of those lines is a little bit higher. But mix is not a concern. And as we will start seeing biscuit growing volume more consistently most likely in the U.S., I think you're going to see the benefit of mix coming through. But there is nothing really to worry about down-trading or anything else. Operator : Next, we go to the line of Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley. Pamela Kaufman : So your full year guidance for at least 10% organic sales growth implies that Q4 slows to high single-digit growth compared to over 11% organic sales growth year-to-date. So how should we think about the degree of conservatism in your outlook? And have you seen any changes in the operating backdrop that make you more cautious about the near-term trends? Luca Zaramella : I mean, your math is right, obviously. The implied Q4 growth is 7%-plus, but importantly, there is a plus in there. So we might have more than 7%, which is something that obviously we might have. Reality is we are about to implement pricing actions and what we want is to end the year, particularly on the trade stock side, on a good position. We don't want the trade of retailers to be impacted by more stock. And so you might call us conservative and we will see. Reality is into the current guidance, which is 10%-plus on both revenue and EPS, I think we feel quite comfortable that there might be a little bit of upside. But we will try to make sure that we end the year in the right place in light of 2023. Pamela Kaufman : Great. And then can you talk about the drivers of your market share improvement and earlier expectations for market share improvement in the U.S.? Where are you in rebuilding capacity on inventory levels on some of the brands where you saw capacity constraints shortages? Dirk Van de Put : Yes. So as we said in the last month, we've already seen market share gains. We expect that to continue and we expect a good tailwind market share-wise into 2023. The overall industry headwinds are moderating. That is helping. So logistic challenges have improved. Still a little bit of issues on cross-border transportation from Mexico. But within the U.S., we're doing quite well. The labor market is easing, so our third-party manufacturers are having an easier time with that. And so I would say turnover is still high but we are continuing to be at a good staffing in the plant. As a consequence of all that and us sort of focusing on the key SKUs, doing a number of changes in our factories, making sure that we have longer runs of SKUs and so on, our service levels have consistently improved now every single month in the quarter. So we're now back in the high 70s, nothing here to brag about but clearly improving. The consequence of that is that trade inventory levels are continuing to recover, so we have less out of stocks, and that starts to show in consumer offtake. Most of our biscuits brands are already in positive share territory. In September, our biscuit share was up, as I said, and we expect that share growth to accelerate in Q4 because the on-shelf availability recovery is going quite well now. On top, we will increase our A&C investment in the fourth quarter in the U.S. We, so far, had held back a little bit because of those supply chain issues. But now to accompany the price increase, we're going to significantly step up our investments. So we expect that we will enter '23 with a good momentum in the U.S. Operator : Our final question for today comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Mizuho. John Baumgartner : I just wanted to come back to emerging markets and specifically the vol/mix component of growth there. Can you just speak a bit more to the breakdown between the contributions from underlying consumption? I guess just from the COVID recovery but then also specific to your investments, whether it's distribution growth, innovation, the local jewels, regaining share. How would you rank order the contributors to vol/mix? And then should we expect any change to the balance of those drivers going forward? Dirk Van de Put : Yes. So I think it's a mixture of the two in the sense that we have very strong investment in our brands. We have a confident consumer in emerging markets, and that is leading to robust volume growth. They are also more used to an inflationary environment. And I'm talking about the consumer but also about our teams to constantly, year after year, deal with this pricing and RGM. So that is leading to very robust volume growth, I would say. Our volume in Q3 is up 7%, which is quite extraordinary. The other thing I would say is that we are also increasing our distribution, which is an added benefit. If you think about China or India, we're literally adding tens of thousands of stores every year through our distribution and that obviously helps. The third thing that I would mention is the strength of Oreo and the fact that we are investing now across the board a little bit more in Oreo, and we're seeing good results from that, so Oreo's becoming very strong for us in these markets. And we -- for instance, in Mexico, we expect to see some big effects from Ricolino where we are tripling our route to market. So that will start to play a role also.  So I would say it's a combination of very good investment, confident consumer, careful management of RGM. We are not doing across-the-board price increases but playing it very careful in the different countries, combining with good distribution gains. That is what's leading to that strength in emerging markets for us. Operator : This does conclude today's program. We thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at any time.",

Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Mondelez management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondelez. Sir, please go ahead. Shep Dunlap : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO; and Luca Zaramella, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the Company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. As we discuss our results today, unless noted as reported, we'll be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures, which adjust for certain items included in our GAAP results. In addition, we provide our year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis unless otherwise noted. You can find the comparable GAAP measures and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation. Today, Dirk will provide a business and strategy update, followed by review of our financial results and outlook by Luca. We will close with Q&A. I'll now turn the call over to Dirk. Dirk Van de Put : Thanks, Shep, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. I will start on Slide 4. I am pleased to share that we delivered another record year, not only in size of the company, but also in profit dollar growth. Our strong topline performance was driven by excellent pricing execution and continued volume strength as consumers all over the world remain loyal to our iconic snacking brands. We delivered strong topline performance in both emerging and developed markets while continuing to exercise cost discipline. In keeping with our strategy of achieving global snacking leadership, we continue investing in our brands and capabilities while strengthening our portfolio with important bolt-on acquisitions that increase our exposure to attractive and growing categories and profit pools. We executed well against our long-term algorithm, returning $4 billion in capital to shareholders. Perhaps most importantly, we continue to invest in our people, building a deep and diverse team whose local routes and global insights enable us to stay a step ahead of rapidly changing customer and consumer tastes. We are confident that the strength of our brands, our proven strategy, our continued investments, and especially our great people position us well to achieve our long-term financial targets in 2023 and beyond. Along with our financial performance, I'm pleased to share that we made significant progress towards our environmental, social and governance agenda. You recall from our investor update last spring that we have elevated sustainability as the fourth pillar of our growth acceleration strategy. That's because we firmly believe that helping to drive positive change at scale is an integral part of our value creation with positive returns for all our stakeholders. Let me share a few highlights on Slide 5. First, we continued to advance our leadership in more sustainably sourcing cocoa and wheat, our two most critical ingredients. We launched the next chapter of Cocoa Life, our signature cocoa sourcing program with another $600 million commitment, bringing our total investment to $1 billion. Cocoa Life is working to lift up the people and restore landscapes where cocoa grows. Similarly, we will launch in the first quarter of 2023, an updated vision for our Harmony Wheat program focused on more sustainably sourcing wheat across the European Union. We continued advancing our Light and Right packaging strategy. For example, our Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolate in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand now are wrapped in packaging with more than 30% recycled content. We also continue to make progress on tackling climate change. We expanded our use of renewable energy to reduce our Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse emissions, and in about 80% of farms in our Cocoa Life program in West Africa, we achieved near to no deforestation, reducing Scope 3 emissions. Since 2018, we have reduced our CO2 emissions by more than 20%. We also remain focused on advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion because we firmly believe that diverse perspectives and viewpoints make our company stronger while helping us stay closer to our customers and consumers. As an example, we increase the gender and racial diversity of our Board of Directors with the appointment of industry leading experts. We are proud of team Mondelez continued success in making important impacts on these critical environmental, social and [governments] issues, while creating value for our shareholders and other key stakeholders. Turning to Slide 6, you can see that we had a record year despite challenging operating conditions. We view our strong performance in 2022 as evidence that our long-term strategy continues to deliver for our stakeholders. Organic volume grew 2.7% for the year on pace with recent years, demonstrating the continued strength of our resilient brands and categories even in an inflationary environment. Organic net revenue grew by 12.3%, significantly lapping the prior three years performance with broad-based growth across all regions. We also delivered record adjusted gross profit dollar growth of $1.4 billion. We are proud of our team's ability to offset major cost pressures to enable us to continue investing in the business, which will drive further growth acceleration. Accordingly, we increased A&C investment by double-digit, helping to keep our brand top of mind for both consumers and customers. These pricing cost management an investing activities translated into strong operating income growth of more than $580 million. We remain confident that our virtuous cycle of strong gross profit dollar growth, which fuels local first commercial investment and execution, will continue to consistently deliver attractive profit growth. We are especially confident that our unique growth strategy centered on acceleration and focus will enable us to continue to successfully navigate the dynamic global operating environment, differentiating us from many other food companies. On Slide 7, you can see that despite the volatile environment, we have the right setup and strategy to ensure we deliver against our growth algorithm. Momentum in emerging markets, with particularly China and India showing strong results combined with the resilience of our categories as evidenced by strong volume growth is helping us to offset the challenges that many companies are facing, such as global cost inflation, the energy crisis, recession concerns in Europe and supply chain volatility. Our consumer continues to hold up well across most geographies, prioritizing snacking and buying more volumes of our products despite significant price increases. Our U.S. supply chain is gradually getting back to normal after a long period of sub-optimal customer service triggered by the 2021 strike and the subsequent overall supply chain volatility. We are continuing to implement appropriate incremental price increases across key markets, including Europe. We also continue to take appropriate action to hedge our commodity costs while continuing to advance our ongoing productivity initiatives. All of the above allows us to increase our investment in brands and capabilities every year, which underpin our growth momentum. Our ability to deliver real dollar growth enables us to make sound and choiceful decisions that drive the business forward and position us well for continued future growth. Slide 8 shows that our performance in 2022 gives us confidence that we have not only the right growth plan, but also the right execution to deliver it. Our core categories of chocolate and biscuits remain attractive and durable in both developed and emerging markets. We are accelerating our focus on these core categories because they have attractive growth and profitability characteristics and still a significant headroom in terms of penetration and per capita consumption. Our long-term vision is to generate 90% of revenue through these two core categories. We hit an exciting milestone in the biscuit category this year as Oreo surpassed $4 billion in global net revenue, further solidifying its position as the world's favorite cookie. Our acquisitions of Chipita and Clif Bar helped us expand our footprint in the growing Baked Snacks segment. While our acquisition of Ricolino helped us fill an important geographic white space, establishing a strong foothold in a priority emerging market of Mexico. We also continue to expand our presence in high growth channels, segments and price tiers. For example, silk premium chocolate doubled its prior year penetration in India, while in emerging markets, we added more than 400,000 additional outlets, and we have significant runway ahead of us. These are just a few examples of the ways our teams remain relentlessly focused on delivering the growth and acceleration plan we outlined at our Investor Day last spring. As Slide 9 indicates, we continue working hard to reshape our portfolio, which will accelerate our growth, and I'm pleased to share that we made significant progress in 2022. As we continue to drive focus on chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks, our nine strategic acquisitions since 2018 have enabled us to enter exciting adjacent spaces such as wellbeing and premium. They also have strengthened our presence in key geographies and expanded our trade coverage. Together, these acquisitions add nearly $3 billion in revenues and are all growing high single- or double-digit. Strong execution against our proven integration playbook enabled us to rapidly realize the value of the three acquisitions we closed in 2022. The Chipita business provides us an important platform to further accelerate growth in the attractive biscuits and baked snacks category. Similarly, Clif Bar expands our global snack bar business to more than $1 billion. Additionally, Ricolino Mexico's leading confectionary company doubles the size of our business and more than triples our routes to market in Mexico. Along with successfully integrating these three businesses, we announced in late 2022 the sale of our developed market gum business to Perfetti Van Melle for an implied EBITDA multiple of about 15x. This divesture will help fund these recent acquisitions and streamline our portfolio. We continue to have the Halls business, which has been performing well, but still intend to divest it over time in a way that maximizes value. In conclusion, I'm pleased to reiterate that 2022 was a record year. Our focus and portfolio reshaping strategy is working and we are well positioned to continue driving attractive growth in 2023 and beyond. By continuing to double down on the attractive chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks categories, investing in our iconic brands, focusing on operational execution and cost discipline, and empowering our great people, I am confident that we can deliver strong performance for years to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca to share additional insights on our financials. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Dirk, and good afternoon, everyone. In 2022, we delivered unprecedentedly strong results, starting with double-digit topline growth through both volume and value, which in turn translated into gross profit dollar growth, allowing the investment in the business, solid earnings and cash flow. Growth was also broad-based in terms of regions, categories and brands. Revenue growth was 12.3% and 15.4% for the year and the quarter, respectively. Importantly, nearly 3 points of full-year growth and 1.6 point of Q4 came from volume mix. Emerging markets increased 22% for the year and 24.7% for the quarter with strong performance across a significant majority of countries, including Brazil, China, India, Russia, Mexico, the Western Andean countries, and Southeast Asia. More than 7 points of full-year growth in emerging market was driven by volume mix, confirming the great momentum of these geographies. Developed markets grew 7% for the year, and 10.5% for the quarter. Volume mix in developed markets was flat in Q4 as there were still some ongoing negotiations at the beginning of the quarter in the EU, that resulted in customer disruption, which in turn offset some good momentum in countries like the U.S, Canada, Australia, and others. Those negotiations are now fully closed, but we have just announced another pricing round in Europe. Turning to portfolio performance on Slide 12. Our chocolate and biscuit businesses both delivered double-digit growth, while gum and candy continue to recover with improved mobility. Biscuits grew 11.7% for the year and 18% for the quarter, supported by significant volume growth. Oreo, Ritz, Chips Ahoy!, Tate's, Give & Go and Club Social were among the brands that performed very well. Chocolate grew more than 10% for both the year and quarter with significant growth across both developed and emerging markets. Volume mix was virtually flat in Q4 due to customer disruption in Europe. Emerging market posted exceptional double-digit growth for the year and the quarter. Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka, Lacta and Toblerone, all delivered robust growth. Gum and candy grew 25% for the year and the quarter. Brazil, Mexico, and the Western Andean area all performed well. Now let's review market share performance on Slide 13. We held or gained share in 40% of our revenue base, which includes 15 points of headwinds coming from the U.S. supply chain, that while improving, still weighs on the full-year share performance. Chocolate held or gained share in 50% of our revenue base. This number include a strong Christmas season, which gains in several key countries, but also reflect customer disruption in Europe. Retailer and consumer activities are now vastly restored in the region, but the price that we just announced might have a negative impact in the first two quarters of 2023 as far as share goes. Our biscuit business held or gained share in 25% of our revenue base. This includes 30 points of headwind from the U.S. supply constraint and customer disruption in Europe. The U.S. made significant service level improvements in the back half of 2022 narrowing share losses and we expect this trajectory to continue to improve in 2023. Turning to Page 14. For the year, we delivered strong double-digit OI dollar growth, driven by a record high increasing gross profit of nearly $1.4 billion. In Q4, we also saw strong double-digit OI and gross profit dollar growth. Moving to regional performance on Slide 15. Europe grew 7.4% for the year and 8.7% for the quarter. Thanks to strong execution, volume mix was flat for the year despite customer disruption in Q3 and Q4. Brand support remains a priority in the region and we have continued to increase our A&C. OI dollars for the year were up 4.3% and 12.4% for the quarter and the year, respectively. Q4 profitability saw a return to growth due to an additional price increase and the emerging market performance within the segment. To close on Europe, we continue to see more pronounced inflation in this region based on energy and other input costs. We also expect to see challenge margins in Q1 given our expectations of customer disruption. Although we saw a small uptick in elasticity for Q4, European consumer has continued to hold up well and the preference for snacking and trusted brands remains strong with elasticity levels below normal. North America grew 12.3% for the full-year and 19.5% for the quarter, higher pricing, robust volume mix and strength from our ventures such as Tate's and Give & Go fueled those increases. Volume mix was 0.8% for the year and 4.2% for the quarter. North America profit increased 18.7% for the year and 37.3% for the quarter due to strong pricing and healthy volume results. Besides the benefits of our pricing execution, the consumer remains resilient and elasticity continues to be well below normal levels. AMEA grew 12.5% for the year and 13.6% for the quarter with strong volume growth for both periods. India grew strong double-digit for the year and quarter, driven by both chocolate and biscuit. China increased high-single digits for the year despite COVID restrictions in certain cities and posted double-digit growth for the quarter. Finally, Southeast Asia also delivered strong double-digit growth for both periods. AMEA increased OI dollars by 9.8% for the year and 8.8% for the quarter continuing their virtual cycle. Latin America grew 31.9% for the year and 37.1% for the quarter with robust volume mix growth coupled with strong price contributions. All key markets posted double-digit increases for the quarter. Latin America has had its strongest year ever in terms of OI delivery. In fact, OI dollars in Latin America grew 48.5% for the year and more than 45% for the quarter. Broad-based volume growth, pricing and ongoing improvements from the gum and candy categories drove these results. Next to EPS on Slide 16. Full-year EPS grew 11.9% in constant currency. This growth was primarily driven by operating gains. And despite very significant currency headwinds, we grew adjusted EPS as reported ForEx by 3.5%. Turning to Slide 17. We delivered $3 billion of free cash flow for the full-year, including a one-time expense of $300 million related to the Clif acquisition and buyout of its employee stock ownership plan. Turning to outlook on Page 19. For the current year, we expect to deliver on or in excess of our long-term algorithm for all variables. There might still be meaningful variability for the year, so we expect plus 5% to plus 7% organic net revenue growth, which stands from the higher pricing. We also expect on our growth to adjusted EPS of high single-digit. Somewhat like 2022, we expect a slightly different shape related to the P&L with higher topline, strong profit dollar growth and lower than historical margin rate given elevated inflation and related pricing away in dollar terms. As far as assumptions grow, we are planning for another year of double-digit inflation with dollars higher than in 2022. This inflation is driven by the continued elevated cost in packaging, energy, ingredients and labor. This input costs are also more pronounced in Europe and some select emerging markets. We also had favorable coverage versus the market in 2022. And although spot rates have been easing in many cases, new hedges are coming at higher levels than what was incorporated in March of last year. We are taking action with a flexible hedging program by using options to minimize risk and volatility, whether commodity rise or fall significantly from current rate. That is to reassure you that in case of commodity price dislocations, we will still be in a position to hit our profit commitment while still investing for growth. In terms of interest expenses, we expect an incremental $90 million for the line associated with the financing of recent acquisitions that we plan to repay later in the year with the developed gum divestiture proceed. We are planning for a net increase in total pension cost of around $25 million as above the line service cost will be lower and below the line element will be worse due to the rising interest rate. Important to note that due to our strong funding levels, we do not have to make additional contributions to our plan. We will also benefit from the higher OI dollar contribution from the acquisitions of Clif and Ricolino and their related synergies. In terms of phasing, we expect Q1 to be lower from a margin rate perspective due to lower volumes in Europe associated with the expected customer disruptions and Chinese New Year phasing. Disruption in Europe might also continue into Q2. We are expecting $0.04 of EPS headwinds related to ForEx. With respect to free cash flow, we expect another strong year with $3.3 billion plus absent any significant one-time non-operating item. In this outlook, we also expect an adjusted effective tax rate in the low to mid-20s based on what we know today and a share repurchase of around $2 billion. With that, let's open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Your line is open. Andrew Lazar : Great. Thanks so much. Two questions for me, if I could. First, Dirk, maybe you could provide a bit of a state of the union in key markets, especially in Europe in terms of just what you're seeing with the consumer in response to recent pricing and if there's any sort of early update on what you're hearing from the most recently announced pricing in Europe? And then, Luca, you talked a little bit about a different shape to the year than would be typical. And it sounds like that's mostly incremental inflation and sort of the mechanics of pricing impacting margin. But just wanted to make sure that's kind of what you see it as as opposed to anything that could be deemed more structural that we should be concerned about when it comes to sort of the margin percentage compression that could still be the case, I guess, for the full-year a bit. Thanks so much. Dirk Van de Put : Okay. Thank you, Andrew. Yes. I would say we feel good if I look at the total business about the strength of our portfolio and the diversification that we have within that portfolio. So when there are some areas that are bit of a more difficult situation, we always have other areas that compensate for that. And so we can keep on delivering very good results. And it goes across brands, regions and categories for us. I also feel good about the strong topline performance with good execution of our pricing, but also for the year, almost 3 points of volume growth, which is in line with the previous years of volume growth. And I think that is a testimony to the strength of our brands and the categories. Share is obviously below expectations, but there is very good explanations for that because we had disruptions in our U.S. supply chain. And then also in Q3 and Q4, disruption with our European customers because of the price increases. I think also something that we feel particularly good about is our broad-based strength in emerging markets from a top, but also very importantly, from a bottom line perspective. And as you know, we're very focused on growing dollars in the gross profit line and the $1.4 billion is a very strong result, which enables us to offset some of the extra costs we're seeing, but also to significantly continuing to invest in our brands and increase our bottom line. Our margins, of course, are impacted by elevated inflation. It's something that it has a denominated effect as we price against that, but we do expect that over time, margins will come back. And then despite currency headwinds, we are having in constant \u2013 or in adjusted EPS, we have double-digit, but we still grew real EPS by 3.5%. So overall, I would say we feel very good about the results. If I look at the consumer \u2013 the volume growth rates, which is what we are looking for to see really how strong the categories are holding up really well. We see very good in-home consumption in the U.S. In Europe, there are some signs of a bit of a category slowdown. That's the only region where our categories are slowing in negative volume growth. But I would counter that with very strong volume growth in all our other regions, particularly in places like Brazil, India, China. I think from a competition perspective, we will start to see the differentiation between companies that can continue to invest in their brands and keep a very positive algorithm, while others will have to focus more on costs, and cutting back in this cycle. As it relates to pricing, so the pricing for 2023 in the U.S. has passed and is implemented. So we did that in December. In Europe, we have started discussion with our clients. I would say we are 60% done of what we need to do. So far, so good, but there is obviously still a few weeks and months to go, and we will know more by the end of March, beginning of April, where we stand. But so far, so good, I would say. The other thing I would mention as it relates to the consumer is that the elasticity is still very low. This is a slight uptick in Europe, but still well below the expectations. We are planning for more elasticity in our 2023 outlook, but we still have to see that materialize. The other one, I think is important to mention is that we will have double-digit cost inflation. There's a lot of talk about diminishing inflation. We don't see that at the moment, and that is driven largely by energy, ingredients and labor. Nevertheless, if you take all that together, I think we are positioned well for 2023. Luca will talk a little bit about the different shape of our P&L, but we will be on algorithm with a higher topline, but that is driven to the whole inflationary situation. So maybe Luca, I hand it over to you. Luca Zaramella : Yes. Thank you for the question, Andrew. And as it relates to the shape of the P&L, particularly on gross margin, you will see some pressure, particularly in the first part of the year, a result of a couple of things. One, it is elevated inflation and us having particularly good coverage in 2022 and lapping the favorable pipeline that we had in commodity terms in 2022, and the fact that clearly, pricing, particularly for Europe, is not fully implemented yet. The new pricing wave I mean. And that is also compounded by the expectation that we will have some customer disruption kicking in towards the end of Q1 and potentially also into Q2. Having said that, I think when you look at the fundamentals of the business, I feel quite good about emerging markets. You saw the stunning number that we printed for Q4 and for the year. The momentum of those emerging markets is continuing into Q1. We started the year quite strongly. I'm quite happy with the U.S. and North America in general. I think there was an excellent pricing execution. And obviously, as the last pricing wave comes into effect into the P&L, that allows for reinvestment in the business. And I think also you will be positively surprised by share throughout the year. Clearly, EU is a little bit of a watch out. Happy to say that the profitability, as you saw in Q4 improved quite a bit compared to Q3 and that is the testament to the team of the pricing that was implemented. But clearly, there are some unknowns in relation to further pricing and potential disruption, and we have commented on consumers in general. So look, the key assumption here is double-digit inflation. Part of it is driven by the favorable coverage we have. And we will stay disciplined in pricing it away. And as I said in the prepared remarks, if commodities take a more benign impact, we will be able to take advantage of it because we have flexible coverage implemented. Andrew Lazar : Thanks so much. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you, Andrew. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Kenneth Goldman : Hi. Thank you. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, Ken. Kenneth Goldman : I may have missed this, but did you guys by any chance to talk about your expectation of price versus volume mix this year? I recognize it's not something you typically give in guidance, but I'm just trying to get a sense for how to model that a little bit cleaner just given some of the puts and takes? Dirk Van de Put : So I'll give you a little bit of a high-level answer. And the answer is, we have planned for modest volume contribution into 2023, and quite frankly, that is the direct outcome of us planning for historical elasticities rather than what we have seen as of recent. So there might be a little bit of an upside versus that assumption. As you dissect the business a little bit more, I believe you're going to see good volume growth in emerging markets, particularly in countries like China, India, Brazil and so on and so forth. You are going to see volume growth in North America. Clearly, there is an element of us replenish in stock with the trade that has a positive impact. But importantly, I think U.S. biscuit is really on solid ground and all the ventures, namely \u2013 Give & Go and paid particularly are really delivering volume growth versus last year. And finally, where I think you're going to see volume pressure is in Europe, and that is the direct outcome of potential customer negotiation disruption and relatively higher elasticity than in other places in the world. So volume leverage, I think, will be one important component of the 2023 P&L shape. Three regions, I believe, will be on positive ground in Europe due to disruption, there might be some volume pressure. Overall, I think you're going to see modest volume growth for the year. Kenneth Goldman : Very helpful. If I can just ask a quick follow-up. You talked about partly the reason for losing share in 2022 was because of your European customer disruptions, are your competitors not being disrupted as much? I'm just curious, are they not pricing up as much as you? Is it more of a timing issue? It just feels like if everyone's pricing up, maybe there shouldn't be share loss, but I'm missing part of that perhaps? Luca Zaramella : Yes. Well, we have to take into account that our main competitors in Europe are private companies. And what we've seen is that they have not priced as aggressively as we have. We assume that, that eventually will have to come, but that is the main difference between us and competition. And so that is the explanation of the share loss. Some of the \u2013 the other competitors have had some events that they lapped of the year before, and that has helped them also to gain some share this year. So those are the two big reasons. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Chris Growe with Stifel. Your line is open. Christopher Growe : Hi, good evening. Thank you. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, Chris. Christopher Growe : I just had a question for you \u2013 hi \u2013 on \u2013 just a follow-up on Europe. If you look at 2022 fiscal 2022, were you able to get pricing up in line with inflation in Europe? And I guess I'm trying to understand if you look at 2023, is there any sort of catch up in pricing you expect in Europe, if that's possible, which may sort of compound some of these issues with share there? Luca Zaramella : Chris, I think as you look at the quarterly gating in 2022, you saw the most pressure in terms of profit delivery in Europe in Q3. And in there, there was the fact that we were running out of hedges for the first part of the year and pricing was not fully implemented. As you saw in Q4, profit is up soundly. And in that context, we also increased investments. So as we close the year, the absolute inflation that you would expect annualized compared to the pricing annualized was a wash. The point here is, as we walk into 2023, there are a couple of events that came into play. One, it is the material energy pressure and the fact that in 2022, we had positive coverage in that area. And the second one is the fact, clearly that we have to price again. So all considered the 2022 inflation that was embedded in the base and the pricing wasn't at worse by the end of the year in terms of annual impact. Now going into 2023, there is more pressure coming and subsequent price required. You are going to see some subpar numbers in terms of profit for Europe, most likely in Q1 and Q2 as a result of pricing not fully implemented yet and customer negotiations. But then by Q3 and Q4, there will be a recovery of margins and profitability in Europe. And again, in this context, the last thing we want to do is to cut on investment, and we will continue to invest A&C regardless of pricing negotiations going on. Christopher Growe : Okay. Thank you for all that color. That was a good answer there. Then the other question I have was just in relation to China. You had a strong performance there this quarter and through the year. Is that a tough comp for 2023? Or if we see some improvement in mobility and travel, should that help China grow at even faster rate in 2023? Dirk Van de Put : I wouldn't say that we are immediately planning for a faster rate in China. But certainly, if you look at the country coming out of the COVID situation and the restrictions starting to ease and the travel restrictions being lifted, on top of that, our plants are open and operational, which was not always the case during the past year. So I think that we will be having a good supply situation, we do have some increased costs, and we will have to deal with that through price increase. But overall, I would expect China to continue with a high single-digit to double-digit growth for next year. The gum business, we expect to come back and we would continue on momentum with the biscuit growth that we've seen. We continue to increase our market share. I see no reason why that would not continue next year also. And so apart from the pricing, all the other indicators for China are pretty positive for us. Not quite sure if that really immediately translates in acceleration, but high-single digits to low double-digit is doable for China for next year. Luca Zaramella : Maybe just one little add. There is a little bit of phasing as it relates to Chinese New Year. So in Q1, you're not going to see double-digit revenue growth. But as Dirk said, the fundamentals of the business are very strong, and the team is executing extremely well in the country. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jason English : Hey, good morning folks. A couple of questions\u2026 Dirk Van de Put : Hi, Jason. Jason English : Hey, there. Congrats on the strong finish to the year, by the way. First, on the China New Year, can you help me understand that a little bit more? Is it that you shift, you pulled more into the fourth quarter, so we don't get the benefit in Q1? And also on timing, the North America volume was very robust, certainly more robust than we expected. Is there anything unique or one-time in nature that's helped the health volume in that region this quarter? Luca Zaramella : So let's tackle maybe this last one first. As you think about volume in the U.S., clearly, the share situation is improving. The category despite double-digit pricing is posting volume growth, particularly in Q4. So we saw value and volume growing within the category, as I said, shall improve, but importantly, we are also recuperating service level, and that clearly helps a bit. So I believe all in all, there is a strong foundation in the biscuit business in the U.S. And the second element that has to be taken into account is the fact that what we call ventures, namely Give & Go, Hu and also Tate's are delivering volume and value growth. And we are clearly taking advantage of synergies, particularly in the case of Tate's, we are very pleased with the fact that, that platform going into DSD has delivered material revenue and bottom line growth. And clearly, in the case of Give & Go, we are seeing after price increases, the category thriving and that drives really the volume. In terms of Chinese New Year, China was north of 10% in Q4. And there was, I would say, 3, 4 points of contribution coming out of that 10-plus percent due to Chinese New Year. Clearly, that is a reversal in Q1. But again, fundamentally, the business remains very sound. I think you're going to see continued share gains. And we're not talking about small share gains in the category of biscuits. And again, as the country reopens, one of the things that we missed throughout 2022 was gum growing. And Gum is going to come most likely positive in 2023, and that will help also the bottom line because margins in gum are higher than in biscuits. So hopefully, that addresses your question. Jason English : Yes. Very helpful. And a good segue into my second question is you brought up gum in margin mix. As we bridge out your margins for the fourth quarter, we've got a very big hole in our margin bridge, suggesting that we're meaningfully underestimating the amount of inflation, or there's some unusual cost or perhaps some much larger mix headwinds than you've contested with for the rest of the year. Can you unpack it for us and give us a little more color because with the price you got and the acceleration, it was just surprising to see margins move so much further south? Luca Zaramella : Yes, I don't think \u2013 I mean, mix was positive. So I don't think mix in general is a problem. I think you saw gum and candy growing 25%, that's margin-accretive. I think what was underestimated in general in the modeling that I saw around it is the impact of inflation and the subsequent price that was coming out of it. As we price away dollar for dollar and not for percentage margins, I think the \u2013 there was an underestimation of both pricing and the inflation despite the fact that we said very clearly, inflation was double-digit. I think the way you have to think about it is you wouldn't have expected for the year a 3% volume growth, you wouldn't have expected a 1.6% volume mix in Q4, which, by the way, when adjusted for the customer disruption due to Europe in Q4 is again down about 3%. So I think versus what you had in mind, there is much better volume. There is higher inflation, there is higher pricing and the fact that we price dollar for dollar creates a little bit of pressure on the percentage margin. I think in terms of OI margin, you see a good number because obviously, also cost below the line have been kept in control or below GP, I mean. And so that's really all the put and takes that you have within the shape of the P&L. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Your line is open. Alexia Howard : Good morning, everyone. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, Alexia. Alexia Howard : Hi, there. Can I stick with Europe with two questions? The first one, I think you mentioned the category slowdown. And I can't remember whether that was biscuits or chocolate. But is that to do with the high-fat sugar and salt initiative in the U.K.? Or is it just weakness in the consumer in general? And then I have a follow-up? Dirk Van de Put : Maybe we'll do first the categories and then I didn't quite understand the question on the weakness of the consumer in the U.K. Luca Zaramella : Yes. She says it is HFSS or something else. Dirk Van de Put : Okay. So from a category perspective, in Europe, our category performance is obviously different from what we see the overall categories to do. I would say both biscuits and chocolate are showing slightly negative, minus 2%, minus 3%, the overall category in Q4, and that is probably a consequence of the consumer feeling some recession. We're a little bit worse than that driven by customer disruption. But I think that as we go through the first quarter of next year, I think that will gradually come back. I'm talking about the category here. So it's probably understandable seeing the economical situation in Europe that we see a little bit of a slowdown there. As it relates to the U.K., what we see with HFSS is, first of all, there's two limitations that come from HFSS. One is the limit on the location where HFSS products can be sold in the store. And the other one is a promotion and advertising limitation. The second one is not yet being implemented, that will be in October 2024. But so far, we have the change in store. And so it means that you don't find them in checkouts in the queuing area, no more at the store entrants, no more [indiscernible] and so on. If you look at our business there, which is mainly a chocolate business, it is about 60% plant purchase and about 40% is impulse. And obviously, the impulse is affected by this because you have less interruption locations in the store. But the 60% of plant, of course, continues. We have been partnering with the stores to offset this by finding new secondary promotional locations, making our brands stan6d out in the aisle, moving the singles category, which was the checkouts to the food-to-go areas and so on. So overall, I would say that the initial signs, while showing an effect on sales in the category and for our business, it is less or less bad than we would have expected. So in-store execution seems to be helping and it's helping to mitigate the less off-shelf display that we have. Smaller stores are sort of suffering a little bit more because they have less space to make up for what was lost. So if I look at the category volumes they're down 1.1%, which is not that bad in December for the last 12 weeks, down about 4.5%. But if you take into account that the off-shelf distribution is down by about 30% because of those locations. I would say that the category is holding up quite well as it relates to the changes we're seeing in-store. And so I would say, yes, there is an effect, but it's far from the magnitude that we could have taken, and I'm expecting that the consumer gets used to this new setup of the stores that the volume growth will come back. Alexia Howard : Great. And there\u2019s a super quick follow-up. I'm curious about these customer disruptions in Europe continuing into, I think you said the first quarter and 2Q, I thought all the pricing had to be done in the first couple of months of the year. So I thought all those customer disruptions were kind of in the fourth quarter rather than bleeding into the first half of the year. What's happening there? And I'll pass it on. Luca Zaramella : Yes, there are some specific laws in France where, for instance, you have to be done with pricing negotiations by the end of February, reality is particularly on promotions and promotional calendars, there might still be negotiations underway and besides France, other countries can obviously, in terms of negotiations go a little bit longer. So we have announced pricing, we are clearly in active talks with most of the customers, by the way, successful implementation of pricing in places like the U.K., in the Nordics, in Southern Europe, namely Italy and Spain, predominantly. But clearly, places like France and Germany, there is still some ongoing negotiations. And we expect some of the disruption happening in March and potentially spinning over into Q2. That was a little bit the pattern we saw between Q3 and Q4 this year in 2022, sorry. And we expect the equivalent of that in 2023. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Cody Ross with UBS. Your line is open. Cody Ross : Good evening. Thanks for taking our questions. I just want to go back to Jason's question earlier on the consumption or at least your shipments trend stronger than consumption in the developed markets. What is driving that? Was there any pull forward ahead of your price increases that you have going into the market in December and then again in 1Q? And then I have a follow-up? Thank you. Luca Zaramella : The simple straight answer is no. When you look at the European segment, I think you saw a volume decline of \u2013 volume mix decline of 4%. So the last thing we did was to preempt the trade before future price increases. So no question, particularly in that segment. As you look at North America, when you dissect the performance of volume growth of North America, as I said, the category has positive volume dynamics. In that context, we are delivering better share. And the third element is, we are improving customer service level and increasing to sound levels that are not sound yet. The retailer-related stock. So the last thing we did was to increase trade stock ahead of price increases. This is all stock that is being sold and consumed by consumers. Cody Ross : Thank you. That's helpful. And then there were recently headlines in the news about a grocer asking food companies to lower prices on the back of moderating inflation historically on the back of inflationary cycles, would you consider rolling back price increases? Or do you expect to lean more heavily into promotions? And if it is promotions, can you just update us on what you're seeing from the promotional environment? Thank you. Dirk Van de Put : Yes. So the request was in the U.S. And as we explained before, we are certainly not seeing for 2023, our costs coming down. We still are seeing double-digit inflation in our cost. We just implemented a price increase in the U.S. We're implementing price increases in Europe. So we are not in a situation where we can say that costs are coming down, if anything, they're up versus last year. From a promotional perspective, since we are rebuilding our customer service and our inventories in clients, there is no need for us to promote more. In fact, what we've done in last month is promote less to get our customer service back up. As long as volume continues to be this strong, we are not planning to increase our promotional pressure at all. Operator : Thank you. Our last question will come from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Stephen Powers : Great, thank you. Shifting gears a bit. On Slide 9, you talk about the accelerating benefits to total company organic growth from recent acquisitions. And I guess I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about plans and expected contributions from Clif and Chipita and Ricolino in 2023, but I was also hoping you could talk about the profitability of growth from those newly acquired businesses and how that compares at this point to base portfolio profitability, whether you describe the relative bottom line contributions as fairly comparable and proportional or whether there\u2019s still remains upfront investment on the newer additions that will dampen profit margins for a time? Thank you. Dirk Van de Put : Yes. So I can maybe take you through the way we're thinking about the contribution to growth from businesses like Clif and Ricolino, and then Luca can talk a little bit about the margins. So as it relates to Clif Bar, we've taken over in August. We have strong results driven by good demand and good pricing, we had strong double-digit revenue growth, and we had high double-digit EBIT growth in the fourth quarter. We started to implement pricing, which was not normal for them. So we've done two pricing actions last year, and we've seen minimal volume elasticity. We've also started to prioritize the SKUs in their portfolio and working on their supply chain. So we are seeing good supply recovery through Q3, and now we're starting with the integration of the businesses and find the cost and the revenue synergies. So we have a full integration team in place, we have a wide variety of opportunities already identified. As it relates to future growth, I think we have a strong position in the U.S. in the protein and the energy bar space. It's a $16 billion market, which is growing very fast. We have an opportunity to expand through Clif, but also to a business like Grenade in Europe in this space and its well being oriented. It's ESG-focused. So it's right on the money as it relates to consumer interest. But even in the North America, we think that Clif has a huge opportunity for expansion, better distribution, and we are going to complement that with the international opportunity. So I would say that explains a little bit the Clif thinking. As it relates to Ricolino it's a very different type of setup that closed in November so far, well above expectations, top and bottom line. There's a very high strategic fit to in a category perspective that is very complementary to our categories. It allows us to enter chocolate and reinforce our biscuit business in Mexico. One of the biggest benefits is that we can triple our route to markets, which is going to add a significant amount of stores. We will be present in 440,000 plus stores. And they also have a good growth U.S. business, which we are planning to give a boost through our U.S. organization, particularly, of course, in the U.S. Hispanic market. It's a full integration Ricolino Clif is a partial integration. Ricolino will be a full integration and merger of our business with theirs. So there is a significant opportunity for top and cost synergies, and so that will have a big effect on margins. Maybe I'll leave it at that on what those two will do for us. So Luca talk a little bit about the financials. Luca Zaramella : Yes. So I guess you were asking a little bit in terms of relative profitability of these platforms compared to the rest of Mondelez. I would say that Clif, which is almost a $1 billion platform projected into 2023 has sound gross margins at this point in time, given the fact that as we've said, we are about to implement another wave of pricing same dynamics that we saw in our U.S. business, little elasticity so far. So I think the P&L is going to shape up quite well. In terms of gross margin, the North American segment has the highest gross margin of Mondelez, particularly because of the DSD system that is quite effective from that standpoint. But Clif has gross margin that, albeit a little bit below the average of North America they are above the average of the company. So that is really a sound platform in terms of potential and profitability. Importantly, there are material synergies we are after \u2013 we just announced a new organization in place. And clearly, there will be some testing going on the platform through DSD and I think if you see what happened with Tate's this is quite promising potentially. In terms of Ricolino it is a $600 million, $700 million platform. It is growing double-digit at the moment. And in terms of margins, I think it's more important to say that the combination of both platforms between our existing business and Ricolino will step change materially the profitability of Mexico. And I think particularly in route to market and cost synergies, there is a big benefit to come now. We are in the process of combining the two companies. So the fruition into the P&L will come towards the second part of the year. Dirk Van de Put : I think that brings us to the end. Thank you very much for your presence and for your interest in the company. Obviously, if there's any other questions, Shep, and Philippe will be ready to answer them and looking forward to a good first quarter of the year. Thank you. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, everyone. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today's Mondelez International Fourth Quarter 2022 and Full Earning Year Conference Call.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Mondelez International First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Mondelez management and the question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondelez. Please go ahead, sir. Shep Dunlap : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO; and Luca Zaramella, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. As we discuss our results today, unless noted as reported, we'll be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures, which adjust for certain items included in our GAAP results. In addition, we provide our year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. You can find the comparable GAAP measures and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our Q1 2023 earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation. Today, Dirk will provide a business and strategy update followed by review of our financial results and outlook by Luca. We will close with Q&A. I'll now turn the call over to Dirk. Dirk Van de Put : Thanks, Shep, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. I will start on slide four. And I'm pleased to share that we are off to a record start in 2023 with very strong double-digit top line growth in the first quarter, driven by effective pricing and ongoing volume growth. We continue to execute on our long-term strategy and we see robust momentum across geographies and categories. We delivered strong performance in both emerging and developed markets and we successfully implemented circa-80% of our price increases in Europe. Our robust profit dollar growth was driven by volume leverage, cost discipline and pricing to offset cost inflation. Our strategic decision to focus our portfolio on the attractive categories of chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks continues to bear fruit, with consumers gravitating to those categories. We continue to invest in our brands, in our capabilities and our portfolio reshaping initiatives to accelerate and compound growth on both the top and bottom lines. We are confident that the strength of our brands, our proven strategy, our continued investments, and especially our talented people, position us well to deliver another strong year. Based on the strength of these Q1 results and our latest view across businesses, we are raising our revenue and adjusted earnings outlook to 10% plus for the year. Turning to slide five, you can see that the first quarter showed continued momentum across our entire business. Volume mix for the quarter was more than 3 percentage points, on pace with recent performance, demonstrating the continued strength and resiliency of our beloved brands and categories, even in an inflationary environment. We delivered organic net revenue growth of $1.5 billion versus prior year. At 19.4% growth, we delivered our best quarter ever, significantly ahead of our already strong 12% in full-year 2022. We also delivered adjusted gross profit dollar growth of $0.5 billion. Again, we are well ahead of last year's pace with 18.2% growth. We are proud of our team's continued focus and agility, which enable us to continue investing to drive further growth acceleration with an A&C increase of 19% for the quarter. These results translated into strong adjusted OI growth of close to $300 million, up nearly 21% and again well ahead of last year's base. We remain confident that our virtuous cycle of strong gross profit dollar growth, fueling local first commercial execution, increasing investments in our iconic brands empowered by winning culture, will continue to consistently deliver attractive growth. On slide six, a few examples of our brand strategy in action. We continue to invest in our core categories of chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks with strong creative assets, digital personalization at scale, new product launches and great in-store execution. All this continues to strengthen our already strong brand loyalty. It is clear that we are playing in the right categories with attractive growth in volume and dollars combined with solid profitability characteristics. There is also significant headroom in both penetration and per capita consumption in developed and developing markets. We continue to expand the breadth and reach of our chocolate leadership in the attractive and growing Latin America region. For example, we recently launched our chocolate brand, Milka into Colombia. Additionally, we launched two Milka ice cream products in Argentina in association with Froneri. We are excited about these opportunities to explore a new segment and reach more consumers, while expanding one of our most iconic brands into a new consumption occasion. We hit another milestone in the biscuit category, as Chips Ahoy! a $1 billion brand celebrates its 60th birthday. Our fifth largest brand globally Chips Ahoy! Has delivered almost double-digit revenue growth annually since 2018, yielding positive results from our increased A&C spend during that time period. The brand's current key markets are the United States and China, where the business is on a $200 million run rate. But Chips Ahoy! also has a sizable presence in Canada, Latin America and Southeast Asia. We have exciting plans to further expand this franchise, as we grow our leadership in both core biscuits and new shopper bakery innovations around the world. Oreo continues to grow -- to show sorry strong momentum across markets, as consumers continue to demonstrate that this iconic brand is truly the world's favorite cookie. Give & Go is a success story in our baked snacks line. It grew strong double-digits in Q1, driven by solid pricing execution, expansion into adjacencies such as mini donuts and strong category demand. These are just a few examples of our team's ongoing focus on delivering our growth and acceleration strategy as we continue to reinvest in, and drive our very powerful brands. Now let's take a look at our chocolate strategy on slide seven. Tablets remain the centerpiece of our chocolate franchise. Mondelez accounts for more than one-third of this segment's more than 3 times the size of the number two player. We continue to lead the segment year-after year. 2023 is off to a very strong start, aided by the recent launch of our renovated Milka formulation, the creamiest most tender Milka ever combined with some strong local [jewels] (ph). Our tablets business is up nearly half a point in market share, with particularly strong growth in Australia, Canada, Germany and Brazil. We are also performing well in the incremental segments of seasonal and gifting chocolate products. We delivered a record selling for the Easter season across markets, with Milka celebrating its first ever Easter in Chile. Our Cadbury team executed another successful virtual Easter egg hunt reaching more than 300,000 people in the United Kingdom, Ireland and South Africa, making our seasonal products even more iconic. We also are growing in the premium chocolate space. For example Toblerone volume is up more than 15% in Q1, fueled by its relaunch with updated on trend positioning. We are further strengthening the Toblerone portfolio with additional offerings including per lean, and personalized gifting. Switching to slide eight, solid execution against our integration playbook is delivering a strong start to the year for our recently acquired businesses. We are pleased that Clif in Q1 posted double-digit revenue growth and grew profitability by more than 1,000 basis points. We are making strong operational improvements, focusing on enhancing service levels and improving supply chain efficiencies, and we successfully implemented two rounds of pricing. Additionally, we recently announced the consolidation of creative and advertising agencies under a single partner, which will accelerate productivity in our media spend, while continuing to strengthen brand equity and loyalty. Similarly, our Ricolino business continues to demonstrate strong momentum in the fast growing and strategically important Mexican markets and we are making solid progress on integration. Along with our financial performance, I am pleased to share that we continue to make significant progress in our sustainability strategy. We firmly believe that helping to drive positive change at scale is an integral part of value creation with positive returns for all of our stakeholders. As you can see on slide nine, this quarter, we announced the next chapter of Harmony, our European wheat sustainability program. With regenerative agriculture at its heart, this next chapter aims to mitigate climate change and reverse biodiversity losses, while investing in research, seeking to demonstrate that more sustainable wheat is also better quality meal. Created as the first program of its kind in 2008 with just a handful of farmers, the Harmony program now collaborates with more than 1,300 farmers across seven European countries. Our enhanced program will support these farmers in implementing a strongest charter of more sustainable farming practices such as further diversifying crop rotation, protecting pollinators and other wildlife and reducing pesticide use. Our goal is to grow 100% of the wheat volume needed for our European biscuit production under our expanded Harmony regenerative charter by 2030. This is just one example of the way that we are fully integrating our sustainability agenda within our day-to-day business operations and growth strategy. I am proud of team Mondelez continued progress in helping to make positive impact on critical environmental and social issues while creating value for shareholders and other stakeholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca to share additional insights on our financials. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Dirk and good afternoon. Q1 was a great start to the year, broad-based volume, pricing, profit dollar growth, brand investment, earnings and free cash flow, all indicate that our strategy is sound, and our focus on execution is paying off. Our model is working well, while meaningful opportunities still exist to further drive our long-term ambitions. For the quarter, revenue growth was plus 19.4% with more than 3 points from volume mix. Emerging markets grew more than 25%, with strong performance across the overwhelming majority of countries. 4.5 points of this growth were attributable to volume mix. Developed markets grew 15.8% in Q1 with across the board strength, and more than 2 points of growth coming from volume mix. To note the customer disruption in Europe was more benign than we anticipated. Turning to portfolio performance on slide 12, chocolate biscuits, gum and candy all posted robust double-digit increases in Q1. Biscuits grew plus 16.9% with positive volume mix, despite substantial price increases. Oreo, Ritz, Chips Ahoy!, Give & Go and Club Social were among brands that delivered double-digit growth. Albeit not contributing to organic growth Clif posted good growth versus last year too. Chocolate grew more than 18% with significant growth across both developed and emerging markets. Volume was positive, despite some customer disruptions in Europe, albeit lower-than-anticipated. Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka, Lacta and Toblerone all delivered robust growth. And we had a record Easter selling, that based on preliminary data also resulted in record high sellout. Gum and candy grew 35% with robust growth across all of our key markets. Now let's review market share performance on slide 13. We held or gained share in 60% of our revenue base, which includes 10 points of headwinds coming from EU customer disruption. The U.S. continues to make service level improvements and in Q1 with good on-shelf availability and case fill rates, resulting in share being flat to last year. Given stabilization of the supply chain, we feel confident that share will continue to improve during the year in the U.S. Turning to page 14, we delivered strong double-digit to OI dollar growth driven by a gross profit increase of more than $540 million. These results enable us to continue to significantly fund our business for future growth, while also providing strong earnings and cash flow. Moving to regional results on slide 15, we delivered double-digit revenue growth and posted volume mix increases in all regions. This growth, fueled by pricing and volume leverage drove robust OI dollar growth across all regions. Europe grew plus 18.9% with high-single-digital OI growth. We have made progress in lending expected pricing increases with circa 80% of our customers and with lower disruption than we anticipated. We are still planning for some disruption in Q2, which has been factored into our revised outlook as the remaining 20% of our customer base is not done yet. Consumer's confidence has stabilized in much of the region, with many key countries trending back to spring 2022 levels. Elasticities of biscuits and chocolate are overall less negative than we anticipated, including in the U.K., where the impact of HFSS is less material than what we had forecasted. Overall, rather than cutting back significantly on size of their basket, consumers are shopping around, to find attractive deals and trading up and down in terms of pack sizes based on their specific needs and consumer occasions. They remain loyal to branded products, particularly in chocolate. Having said that, our focus is now on landing the remaining part of the price increases. North America grew plus 17.3% with OI dollar growth of more than 40%, driven by higher pricing, solid volume mix and strength from our ventures, particularly pleased. We are reassured by the quality of the P&L in the region and by the fact that volume is holding up well, while we still have opportunity of returning market share to steady growth. AMEA grew plus 13.8% with strong volume mix of nearly 6%. OI dollars increased plus 15.6%. India continues to be a key driver of success in the region and we also have ambitious plans in China that will benefit from a broader reopening after COVID. Latin America grew plus 39%, with OI dollar growth of more than 47%. We are very pleased with the performance in the region with clear progress made over the last couple of years in terms of execution and ability to drive key brands like Oreo to new heights. Ricolino is off to a strong start, but we have not yet realized the benefit of the full integration that will happen towards the end of the year. Next to EPS on slide 16. EPS grew plus 17.3% in constant currency or nearly plus 10% at reported dollars, driven primarily by strong operating gains. Turning to slide 17, we generated free cash flow of $900 million in Q1, returning $900 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. A few words on our recent KDP sell down on page 19. This investments has been highly successful demonstrating our disciplined and flexible approach to managing our investments and assets over time. Including dividends received and the market value of our remaining stake, this investments has generated a return of approximately 3.3 times our initial investment over a seven year period. We received approximately $1 billion in net proceeds from the most recent sale and now remaining stake is now 3.2%. From an accounting perspective, we will no longer account for these under the equity method, but rather recognizing dividends as the only income as of the dividend record day. We will adjust out mark-to-market quarterly re-measurement of the stake, in line with the gains that we have been obtained after each sell-down. These adjustments will be recorded in a new P&L line item, which will be below interest expenses. In terms of net EPS impact for 2023, purely on the basis of the different accounting treatment, we expect a headwind of approximately $0.03. I want to reiterate that this is merely accounting driven and not changing the essence of the investment itself. The gain on this sale, which is approximately $0.5 billion will run through the same account that we have used for past share sales. Finally, albeit a subsequent event to the quarter you might have noticed that we sold down also some stock for JDE Peet's. The transaction was equivalent to approximately EUR400 million through an equal combination of an outright sale and options at an only net discount of 2% to 3% versus the JDE stock price at the time of the transaction. Options had maturity, which is about six months. Both transactions, put us in a good spot in terms of our leverage and debt profile, and together with the expected proceeds of developed market gum, pretty much balanced the outflows related to the acquisition of Clif and Ricolino. Turning to our outlook on page 20, given the strength of our Q1 results and the overall operating environment across our business we are raising our full-year outlook for revenue growth and EPS. We now expect top line growth of 10% plus, versus our original outlook of 5% to 7%. EPS growth is expected to be 10% plus versus our previous outlook of high-single-digit growth. In terms of key assumptions, inflation is still expected to increase double-digit for 2023, driven by elevated cost in packaging energy ingredients and labor while lapping favorable hedges in 2022. In terms of interest expenses, we now expect $400 million for the year, given recent coffee transactions. We now expect $0.09 of EPS of headwinds related to ForEx impact for the year versus $0.04 in our previous outlook. The outlook revision reflect our increased confidence in another exceptionally strong year given the resilience of consumer consumption in our categories, more benign elasticities than we planned and share dynamics in enough to, as well as lower actual disruption and better environment in Europe. Having said that, we might have some more disruption for the remaining pricing, which will potentially affect Q2. Finally, continued strength in our emerging markets is what supports our improved guidance. This current outlook does not consider a material deterioration of geopolitical environment surrounding some areas of our business. With that, let's open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, Andrew. Luca Zaramella : Hi, Andrew. Andrew Lazar : I guess first-off, Dirk. I was hoping you could double click a little bit on the emerging markets performance, which was obviously dramatically better than I think most certainly modeled and were expecting. Organic sales were up 25% and I guess I'm just looking for some color on some key drivers and maybe more importantly, sort of on the sustainability of the performance and how we should think about that as the year progresses? Dirk Van de Put : Okay. Yes, so definitely a very strong performance this quarter, but I would say already for several quarters that we have strength in our emerging markets. Our emerging markets for us are about 40% of our business, and as you said 25% growth in Q1. I think it's important also to see that there has been very strong or solid volume growth around 4%, 4.5% 5%. So it's not just the pricing. If I go a little bit through the markets, India keeps on growing at a very accelerated pace, strong double-digit, no real signs of a slowdown. Our outlook for '23 remains optimistic, and we have to invest in capacity increases, which we are doing. But as you know, it's a combination of the strength of our Cadbury and Oreo franchises who are receiving heavy support with strong innovations and as well a distribution expansion, where we still have a runway for several years to go. In China, we also have strong momentum. There we also see good share gains. We have in the past quarters been establishing Chips Ahoy! as a second biscuits brands after Oreo business as you noticed, mainly Biscuits and gum. And I think with the post-COVID period now in China, we see the confidence of the consumer going up and we're expecting a strong year in China also. Same thing as in India, heavy support in our brands, good innovations, building extra capacity and still big upside on increasing our distribution. In Mexico, we now with the acquisition of Ricolino have significantly increased our distribution power. So there we will see the distribution of Mondelez brands increasing significantly in the coming months. We also have double-digit growth in the quarters, and the whole acquisition and integration of Ricolino is on track. Then maybe adding Brazil. Brazil is also double-digit growth. We continue to see strong demand and we are expanding our distribution also in Brazil. So I would say, overall, the key markets in our emerging markets group are doing well and particularly in Latin America, I would add to that the whole economic environment is pretty strong. Important to note is that they have delivered and are delivering reported dollar growth in top and bottom line. And that the cash flow that we're generating is also very strong. So the return on our investments in emerging markets is very good. And I would say that we believe that we have a sustainable growth engine that will continue for the foreseeable future. The reasons for that we have stepped up in execution in a major way, we now for several years in a row have continued heavy reinvestment in our business. We have these distribution opportunities, and I've been mentioning and we keep on going deeper and deeper into distribution, setting up routes and presence, which are having a very good return, and we keep on doing that year-after-year. And as I've said macroeconomics in Latin America helping, and then also the gum business which during the pandemic suffered is one of the drivers of our growth in Latin America. At this stage consumer confidence is relatively strong. We have high loyalty in our brands and private label in emerging markets remains a relatively small challenge. So we continue to be very optimistic for \u201823 and beyond. We feel that we have plenty of opportunity. We have a lot of headroom for accelerated growth, I would say. The penetration of our categories is very low. The distribution runway in places like China, India, but even in places like Brazil and Mexico are high. And our brands like Oreo. Oreo, for instance is really exploding in Latin-America, but Cadbury in India, Milka that we are now launching throughout Latin America. So we see all this combined gives us the confidence that we will keep on doing well in our emerging markets. Andrew Lazar : Really helpful. Appreciate that rundown. And then just super briefly, Luca, just from a guidance standpoint, it does not seem as though your expectations for the remainder of the year have necessarily changed that much and the upward guidance revisions primarily is based on the better than forecast 1Q results. So, I guess my question is, maybe how should investors think about the sort of the plus and the revised 10% plus constant currency EPS growth outlook, like the sort of the puts and takes are things to consider there. Thank you. Luca Zaramella : Yes, thank you, Andrew, you. Clearly, as we move through the year, we will be lapping materially higher quarter than Q1 last year, which is the only one quarter we had with high single digit. I think we moved obviously sequentially to higher revenue growth throughout the year. Reality is there might be a scenario there where we exceed the 10% floor that we had guided you to in terms of both revenue and EPS, but I think while I feel quite good on the underlying trends of the business, particularly in emerging markets, the strong momentum is there and obviously, we still have headroom to accelerate to a certain extent. I think I'm very pleased obviously with the U.S. and North America, which is on an upward trend. Excellent pricing execution supply chain improving. I think the watch out is a little bit on the European side. Happy with the improved profit in Q1, which is the result of the 80% of the pricing kicking in, but profitability in Europe is still not where it should be. So the remaining 20% of the pricing that is being implemented is important. Unknowns are in relation to this further pricing that is needed, a potentially related disruption and some macro volatility. But obviously as anywhere else in the business, we continue to invest and that coupled with additional pricing that will kick in should result in top about the line. So look. I think it is very early for us to guide you to something that is materially better than what we are saying at this point, but if everything plays out we might have further opportunities. I think the other one I want to hit briefly on which is the assumptions that we're making around commodities. We still see double-digit inflation rate in 2023, with obviously energy sugar ingredient posing most of the pressure. A good part of these inflationary pressures as I reminded these audience a few times, it is due to the favorable coverage we had in 2022. But in general, overall cost are not coming down materially. The most recent spikes in terms of cocoa and sugar prices are offsetting some of the other benefits that we see. I think you might have in the back of your mind percentage margins too. I said it a few times, we continued to be obsessed with dollar growth in cash and there might be some pressure in percentage terms, particularly in the next couple of quarters, but sequentially we will be much better throughout the year and we plan to end, clearly on the gross margin percentage positivity. But reality is we've driving a strategy that has being proven to be compelling for everyone. I said this about dollar growth. Andrew Lazar : Great, thank you so much for that. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you, Andrew. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Ken Goldman : Hey, thank you. I wanted to ask you, most companies that we cover or at least that I cover now, pricing is exceeding their COGS inflation. For you it's still not a full offset. I think you mentioned that it was only a partial offset to the inflation. So I'm just curious, is there point this year when you do get pricing ahead of inflation? Is there any way to kind of forecast that? I just wanted to kind of get a sense of how we think about some of those potential tailwinds ahead, from that perspective. Luca Zaramella : I think all-in all, we are quite pleased with the level of pricing that we have at this point in time. If you look at the three major pricing actions, we have taken in places like the U.S., I mean that is something that you see in the P&L with the segment profit growth that we have displayed here, which is 40%. Obviously that number there is synergies coming out of the ventures. But in general, we are happy with the level of pricing. The same in emerging markets overall. You look at Latin America, you realize how disciplined we have been with pricing. The model in AMEA is slightly different in the sense that volume leverage is absolutely critical in some of these places, and so maybe we have been a little bit less aggressive on pricing than we could have been, but all in all the P&L is working very well. And I think they quoted that A&C year on year is up almost 20%. And that gives you the understanding of how much we are investing in the business and also thinking ahead out of a potential inflationary period. Where pricing is not necessarily where it should be at this point in time, it is Europe. We told you 80% is being -- has been implemented already with a little disruption compared to what we had anticipated. There is still 20% to go. But I think once you get that 20% the picture will look quite a bit different than, in fact, Europe is the biggest segment we have. And I don't want to give the impression that we were shy on pricing, quite the opposite. We have done what was necessary. But obviously in our case we want to keep volume leverage. I think looking at the 3% plus volume mix is something that is remarkable in Q1 and that leverage into the P&L and the profit dollar growth that we have shown, I think it is a winning formula, at least for us. Ken Goldman : Great, I'll pass it on, Thank you. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : All right. Thanks, operator. Good afternoon, everyone. Luca, two quick ones for you. One the clarification, just with the KDP accounting change, is the earnings base that we're using for \u201822 to calculate the EPS growth for \u201823, is that 289, so $0.06 below previous, or is it $0.03 because I think on one of the slides it said, the net effect was $0.03. So just want to make sure we're using the right 2022 base as a starting point. Then, I have a follow-up. Luca Zaramella : Look, the simple answer to that question is we have to take out all the income that was related to KDP last year. And it was roundabout, I think post tax was $90 million give or take. We are replacing that with dividend. And the net effect between a dividend payout, which is roundabout 48% or 50% depending on the base. And the fact that we stripped out earnings last year in the tune of the $90 million, I told you is causing the headwind of $0.03. As we stated the base impact was $0.06 but year-on-year impact is due to accounting is really $0.03. Bryan Spillane : Okay, okay. Yes so, I guess it's clear the base is 289, but as we're adding back you're capturing $0.03 of that $0.06 headwind back in \u201823, right. So but we're still starting -- our starting point is 289 to start the calculations off of for the forward guide? Luca Zaramella : That's correct. Bryan Spillane : Okay, okay. And then. I just had a follow-up and I think it's a follow-up to Ken's question just now. And just thinking about pricing and percentage margins, in the quarter. I think it was an $81 million hit to operating income from currencies, which it was like $0.06 of the $0.09 for the year. I'm assuming it's a little bit of a bigger hit at the gross profit line. We were thinking somewhere between 90 to a 100 basis points, maybe a gross margin. So I guess as we're thinking about margin progression, percentage margins and gross profit dollars. It seems like this is the worst of it, right, unless things change in this quarter in terms of the FX piece and like one tailwind we should see, assuming other things hold is it just that drag from foreign exchange should become a lot less severe as we move through especially the second half. Just want make sure I'm thinking about that correctly. Luca Zaramella : I can tell you that sequentially the gross margin percentage albeit, I don't like talking about it, should improve throughout the year. Obviously today, if I look at gross margin and gross profit dollar growth throughout North America, Latin America, and as I said a good portion of AMEA, I'm very happy with the numbers I'm seeing. Europe is still impacted by the fact that there is 20% of pricing to go. And as we implement that the situation should sequentially improve. Bryan Spillane : Okay, but the FX drag should -- again assuming things don't change from here, the FX drag should become less of a -- much less of an impact that it has been? Luca Zaramella : Absolutely, it should. Bryan Spillane : Okay, all right. Cool, thanks. Dirk Van de Put : You\u2019re welcome. Luca Zaramella : Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. David Palmer : Thank you. Strong results in so many areas, but I'd be interested to hear if you had to choose two or three that really drove your increase versus guidance or upside versus your internal expectations, whether those are current trends or maybe just sources of visibility. I would imagine, what's going on in Europe with retailer and consumer response to pricing is high on the list, but I'd be interested to hear what also makes that sort of top three. Dirk Van de Put : Yeah, the top three from me would be, yes, for sure Europe, where we were expecting a bigger client disruption, and that did not occur in Q1. As Luca said, we are only 80% done with the price increases, and we still have some negotiations going on. We could still see part of that client disruption in Q2, but that has been included in our outlook for the year. But that's certainly significantly better than we had anticipated. The second one that I would mention is the US, whereby you see a very solid top line, but the bottom line is probably the strongest increase driven by first of all, an improvement in our supply chain, but then also very strong recovery of Clif bars profitability since the acquisition, and we expect that positive trends for North-America will continue. And the third one is probably the ongoing strength in emerging markets. I already went there, but if I compare our emerging markets sort of growth of 25%, that stands for me well above any of our colleagues. And that has been going on for several quarters now. So those would be my top three, I would say, of what's carrying the quarter for us and probably is going to carry the year for us. David Palmer : Thank you. That's helpful. I'm wondering to what degree this year, and what you're seeing going on, maybe internally, not just some of the macros informs how you view your company in the long term growth rate, of your company and to some degree we've had COVID obscure what might have been happening in terms of all the changes that have happened and of course you've made plenty of acquisitions that are adding to your long term growth rate. So does this make you feel more optimistic that the long term growth rate is heading in the right direction and higher? Dirk Van de Put : Well. I think the recipe that we have is a strong recipe. We -- I went a little bit for instance in emerging markets through the different growth vectors that we have. But the fundamental principle is to make sure that we are well-positioned from a pricing perspective, that we continue to invest heavily in our brands, that we drive distribution, in-store presence, we work RGM. So we seem to have a recipe and a way of working that is really starting to click. So it certainly gives us confidence that we've got something going here that is very strong. What that exactly means going-forward because we are in a very particular period where last year and this year, we had to implement significant price increases. And I guess to our delight the consumer has not reacted by buying less product. They keep on buying the same or more product. But as we get through those price increases, growth will come down. We will have to see what happens with input costs going forward. So it's difficult to say, but I can certainly say that we are in durable categories that are doing particularly well in the circumstances that we are performing well, within those categories. So we feel very good about our long term algorithm. I think we have to wait a little bit to see where things will pan-out as we get through these price increases and that will be the moment to restate our long term growth algorithm. But so far. I would say very strong and we feel that we are in-line or above our long-term growth outlook algorithm for sure. David Palmer : Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Alexia Howard : Good evening, everyone. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, Alexia. Alexia Howard : Hi, there. So I've two quick questions. And first of all, where are we on the cost synergy recouping for the recent deals that you've done. It seems as though that was quite a strong benefit to profit growth recently, but I'm just wondering how much more there is. Luca Zaramella : So let's start with Clif. We have announced a re-organization, Clif started from a relatively high level of SG&A We have protected and increased A&C and adding which we have been able to obtain Round about $10 million of synergy a year, given better rates that we have. There is already cost opportunities coming into the P&L in the area of selling and administration. The new organization is already in-place. The next step is really to go and get synergies in the area of COGS. So there is still quite a bit of -- a lot of opportunity, just for a reference point, as we acquired this business, the EBIT margin was not great. I think today, in Q1, particularly given the pricing, we have taken which is the other area where we brought quite a bit of discipline, the margin is just shy of 20%. So, it's quite a good outcome at this point in time. There is still more to come. We are thinking potentially about leveraging DSD and doing other things and obviously the biggest opportunity we see is establishing this brand internationally. So that hasn't started yet as a work stream. On Ricolino we just got the business. We have CSA's in-place still with Bimbo. As we implement SAP. And as we move towards the end-of-the year, that\u2019s the moment where we will start getting SG&A costs and COGS synergies, but reality is the biggest opportunity here is to set Oreo through the system and revenue synergy can be very, very material. So there is still more to come on both platforms. And I would say in general in the other ventures, there is still work to be done. And so potential synergies coming out there too. Alexia Howard : Great. And then just as a quick follow-up, can you just quantify how much the retailer inventory rebuild benefited North America this quarter. And is there any more to come on that you will pass it on? Dirk Van de Put : I think there was a slight positivity due to that. But reality is, we had been promoting less-than-optimal. And now that inventory is available, there is opportunity for us to do selective promotions and boost our brands, now that pricing is implemented. So pattern been material, I would say, and obviously in a context where you see this growth rate it is minimal, but we still have opportunities to really replenish stock more and now that we have potentially a little bit of more promotions coming, I think we are in a good position. Alexia Howard : Great, thank you. I'll pass it on. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Jason English : Hey, good afternoon, folks. Thanks for slotting me in. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, Jason. Jason English : Couple of thoughts -- hey there. Couple of quick questions. Both also sticking on North-America for a moment. Great news on the margin progression and congrats on that. That's impressive in such a short-duration. We had been assuming that it was going to be a margin mix drag to both gross margins overall in this segment. With a 1,000 basis-points improvement that you've seen so far. Is it still margin dilutive? Are you now closer to parity with this sector? Luca Zaramella : It is still margin dilutive on the overall segment. But again, as we think about potential opportunities in the years to come. This is another platform that we're going to integrate into SAP in the second part of the year. I'm sure the margins will get better. Pricing has been announced for the last round, but it hasn't kicked in yet. And there is now that we have stopped more opportunities to really activate that point of sales must stop leased as we called them, i.e. the right assortment by store is an area of opportunity that we have. So I'm confident that the margins will look quite close to the U.S. business going forward. Jason English : That's good to hear and sticking on North America, it seems like supply chain has been this overhang that we've been talking about in North America for year upon, year upon year and maybe I'm exaggerating, just because it feels that long. But it's great that you're over the hump and you are seeing improvement. Nice to see the sales side of that. How about on the margin side? Clearly this has been costly to the business. How much of a margin drag the supply chain issues been and how much of a tailwind could that be, as you look to sort of rebuild that? Luca Zaramella : I mean, well. I would say that is the whole -- this is a mix going on with the price increases that we have implemented together with some of the extra costs we're seeing incurred during the pandemic to get the right service and so on. You see in the recuperation face we also promoted less than we were planning because our inventories were low. So it's quite a complex picture to exactly pinpoint how much was due to the disruption, since we have to go through all these additional effect, but certainly is the case that the headwinds have moderated quite significantly. You know about the labor markets, the logistic situation. Our external manufacturers' network has improved significantly. So a lot of the cost headwinds that we were facing have now eased. That still doesn't mean that the cost have come back. There's been significant inflation. But I would say the resulting effects from our supply chain, improve, means that our inventory levels are back to the expected level. Service-level are reaching 90%. Our own sales availability is 96%. We still have some issues in our confectionery brands where the demand is higher than anticipated, and also Clif bar the service levels have fully recuperated. So at this stage I would say that the cost effects and the top line effects have largely eased. And we can now start to function normally with higher promotional levels and cost levels that are better. But it's very difficult for us to estimate exactly what it was. But going forward, things we're doing is we are increasing our capacity. We have changed our way of working and our relationship with our external manufacturers. The Inventories are rebuilt. We have simplified our portfolio. We've increased our -- sorry our warehousing capacity on top of our manufacturing capacity and we have implemented labor strategies for attention, and an improvement in temporary labor. So I think, apart from easing the cost, we've also put in place long-term solutions for our supply chain situation. Difficult to give you the exact number, but hopefully you can feel that we're in a much better spot as it relates to our supply chain in North America. Jason English : Yes, for sure. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on. Dirk Van de Put : Yes, thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from John Baumgartner with Mizuho. John Baumgartner : Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask\u2026 Dirk Van de Put : Hi, good afternoon. John Baumgartner : Yes, good afternoon. I wanted to ask, Luca. I wanted to ask about profitability in AMEA. You're heavy into reinvestment mode there. You also mentioned the pricing disparities in earlier question. So I'm curious at this point how you're thinking about the point at which volume mix growth relative to reinvestment. And I guess what I also think is pretty strong potential for accretive product mix over time. When that begin to yield leverage and sets you back to margin expansion? Or is a mid-teens margin just structural ceiling for AMEA? Thank you. Luca Zaramella : I don't think there is a structural ceiling in AMEA. AMEA is Quite good in terms of profitability overall. I think when you look very closely to AMEA there are a set of countries that are -- I call them cash machines. The India or the China of the regions run on profit margins that are north of the average of the company. We invest in both businesses, roundabout 15% probably and see as a percentage of revenue, which is materially higher than the average of the company and we have cash conversion cycles whereby by growing these companies, not only we get the volume leverage that runs through a very sizable and bold machine both from a manufacturing standpoint, supply chain and sales, but also on negative cash conversion cycle, the cash throughput is impressive. There are countries where we have a little bit less material scale, the likes of Southeast Asia. There are certain countries in Southeast Asia, where the business is still developing, where categories like chocolates are not well established yet. And we are investing to make these categories much bigger for us. And there I think it is a matter of time, because the scale and the volume. We are adding will get to a point where the P&L will make perfect sense. As you might imagine that in these countries, we are investing both in terms of price points and support ahead of material expansion that I think it will come. And then obviously you have countries like Australia that are again, more mature markets where volume grows and we are happy with Australia overall. But it doesn't grow high-single-digit or double-digits as in other places, and there the evolution of profitability is fair. So as you think about AMEA, very happy with the sizable markets that are doing very well. In that emerging markets, like happy with Australia, the rest is the untapped opportunity. We are looking at and we have the obligation to invest for future growth and margins. I think it will come. John Baumgartner : Thanks, Luca. Very helpful. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, John. Operator : And we'll take our last question from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Michael Lavery : Thank you. Good afternoon. Dirk Van de Put : Hi Michael. Michael Lavery : Just wanted to understand, I love like on slide five how clear it is that your A&C spending is almost identical to your sales growth. So clearly, the percentage of your spending as a percent of sales is holding about constant. But you get really some operating leverage there just given the amount of pricing that's driving the top line growth. And so, on a per unit basis you're really coming out ahead. How do you think about managing that going forward? Is it sort of a luxury, you want to maintain. Some of that may be get adjusted to fall to the bottom-line or just help us understand how spending might evolve given how that dynamic sets it up. Luca Zaramella : Clearly the 20% might be something that is on the high side. Now I can tell you one thing. One of the biggest differentiators of this company over the last three years, it has been level of investment. It has been quality of marketing, it has been brand support. We in the end sell brands and it is important that we keep line of sight to that. And I don't think you're going to see a consistently at 20% A&C increase, but at this point in time, where we are moving price points, where we are trying to retain and increase our consumer pools, it is important that we use these as an important accelerator of growth for years to come. And that's what it is at this point in time. When this inflationary cycle is done and good things will get more normal. I think what is a big differentiator is the level of volume and the scale, businesses are still going to have or not have. In our case, if you look consistently over the last few quarters, we have been growing volume. And there is a correlation between the level of investments we are making, both in terms of marketing and distribution. And so I don't think you're going to see consistent in 20% but realities that is still a big opportunity for us to get our brands where they belong, which is higher sales hop3rully quarter-after-quarter. Michael Lavery : That's great color. Thank you so much. Luca Zaramella : Thank you. Luca Zaramella : Thank you. With that we've come through the end of the goal obviously a strong quarter. We're looking-forward at this stage to a strong year. Thank you for your attendance and. Any other questions. Please refer to Shep in the IR team which we can follow-up with. Thank you. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you, everyone. Operator : That concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Mondelez management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondelez. Please go ahead, sir. Shep Dunlap : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO; and Luca Zaramella, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides which are available on our website. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. As we discuss our results today, unless noted as reported, we'll be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures, which adjust for certain items included in our GAAP results. In addition, we provide our year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. You can find the comparable GAAP measures and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation. Today, Dirk will provide a business and strategy update, followed by a review of our financial results and outlook by Luca. We will close with Q&A. I'll now turn the call over to Dirk. Dirk Van de Put : Thanks, Shep, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. I will start on slide four. I'm pleased to share that we delivered strong broad-based top-line growth during the first half of the year. Our strong performance was driven by effective pricing combined with healthy volume growth in three of our four regions. Europe was the lone exception due to expected disruption driven by retailer negotiations. We continue to execute on our long-term strategy and we see robust momentum and solid consumer confidence across geographies and categories. We successfully implemented our planned price increases in Europe, closing our customer negotiations in line with expectations. With this behind us, we feel good about the remainder of the year in Europe. We also feel good about continued consumer confidence. We continue to drive robust demand in our core categories across the vast majority of our businesses, resulting in both value and volume growth. Our strong profit dollar growth was driven by cost discipline and pricing to offset cost inflation. We continue to invest in our brands, capabilities and portfolio reshaping initiatives to accelerate and compound growth and we remain confident that our proven strategy delivered by our world-class team positions us well to deliver another strong year. Based on the strength of our first half performance and our latest view across businesses, we are raising our full year organic net revenue and adjusted EPS growth outlook to 12% plus. Turning to slide five. You can see that the first half of 2023 showed continued momentum across our entire business. We delivered the first half organic net revenue growth of $2.7 billion, up nearly 18% versus prior year and significantly ahead of our already strong 12% in full year 2022. This includes a 15.8% growth for the quarter. We also delivered adjusted gross profit dollar growth of more than $1 billion. Again, we are well ahead of last year's pace with 18.9% growth. We are proud of our team's continued focus and agility, which enable us to continue investing to drive further growth acceleration. Our A&C investment is increasing 18% in the first half of the year. These results translated into strong adjusted OI growth of close to $600 million, up 23% and again well ahead of last year's pace. On slide six, you can see a few examples of our brand acceleration strategy in action. Our continued investments in creative assets, personalization at scale and innovation combined with strong in-store execution are resulting in continued sales growth and brand loyalty increases in our core categories of Chocolates, Biscuits and Baked Snacks. For example, in China we launched Oreo Airy Cake in March driven by the strength of the Oreo name as the world's favourite cookie this new packaged cake already has achieved a 3.5% market share and 80% of the velocity of its leading competitor in large stores. And China is one of our most important emerging markets. This is just one example of numerous innovations to expand our key brands into adjacent spaces and formats. We are also continuing to renovate our recipes to stay a step ahead of changing consumer and customer tastes. For instance, we recently launched our first under 100 calories Cadbury treat for adults. This is a great example of our commitment to help consumers snack mindfully. We are offering a broader range of portion-controlled packs and products, but also our portion-controlled education campaigns both digitally and on pack. In the Baked Snacks segment, we continue to accelerate both top and bottom-line performance in Clif Bar. We remain focused on improving service levels and supply-chain efficiencies, while further advancing productivity and effectiveness in our media spend and continuing to strengthen brand equity. We are also continuing to introduce new culturally relevant flavors to strengthen consumer loyalty for our local jewel brands. For example, Lacta has been a leader in Brazilian chocolate for over 110 years. Following the successful launch of Lacta tablets filled with Oreo we recently rolled out two new line extensions filled with additional Lacta products that Brazilians already know and love. There's Sonho de Valsa bonbons made with chocolate and cashew nut filling as well as Ouro Branco candies made with wafers filled with chocolate cream and covered in white chocolate. These are just a few examples of the innovative ways our teams are driving growth in our iconic chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks franchises continuously investing in new formats pack sizes and flavor combinations that drive incrementality and encourage consumers to experience our brands in new ways. Within the baked snacks segment we are especially excited about our strong performance in the rapidly growing cakes and pastry space. Let's take a closer look on slide seven. Earlier, I mentioned the Oreo Airy Cake in China as a great example of our brand acceleration efforts in emerging markets. Similarly, in developed markets, we are making solid progress in expanding our successful cookie and chocolate franchises into choco-bakery, cakes and pastries. For instance, in the United States, Oreo Cakesters are continuing to perform well. Since the recent launch of this fan favorite, it already has earned a 3.7 share of packaged snacks cakes Give & Go is another solid success story in our North American baked snacks lineup where we are continuing to drive distribution and innovation. Share is up 0.5 year-to-date, driven by solid pricing execution, expansion into adjacencies such as mini donuts, and strong category demand. Meantime, in Europe, 7Days continues to advance its position as the number one package croissant, and we have exciting plans to continue to grow with footprint beyond Europe, including recent test and learn trials in a number of emerging markets. Turning to slide eight. We continue to invest in digital commerce and revenue growth management tools and capabilities to support our brands while strengthening our partnerships with leading customers. I'm pleased to share that we have achieved the number one market share position in digital commerce in our top five markets of the United States, China, United Kingdom, France, and Brazil, while over-delivering in up-and-coming emerging markets such as India, Philippines, Brazil, Mexico, and Poland, which are up 40% year-to-date. We continue accelerating eB2B capabilities to expand distribution and strengthen our partnerships with key customers. Additionally, our increased investments in elevating RGM strategies and actions are driving strong value realization, helping to offset inflationary pressures. We have appointed dedicated RGM leadership and teams in all key markets supported with new proprietary data and analytics assessments, digital tools and a comprehensive training program. We are confident that these ongoing investments will deliver sustainable improvements in growth, efficiency, and ultimately margin. Along with our financial performance, I am pleased to share that we continue to make significant progress in advancing our environmental, social, and governance strategy. In May, we published our annual Snacking Made Right report reinforcing our 2025 goals and documenting our latest performance in priority areas. These include sourcing key ingredients more sustainably, reducing carbon emissions and increasing recyclable packaging. We are also improving performance in social impact and diversity, equity, and inclusion, both internally and in partnership with our suppliers as well as helping consumers snack more mindfully through improved portion education and increased focus on single portion packs. We continue to believe that helping to drive positive change at scale across these important areas is an integral part of value creation with positive returns for all our stakeholders. We encourage you to read our Snacking Made Right report for more details and context on our progress. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca to share additional insights on our financials. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Dirk, and good afternoon. Q2 marked another strong quarter for our business. Double-digit organic net revenue growth across each region, sound pricing execution, strong profit dollar growth and significant brand reinvestment enable us to continue driving sustainable value creation. Revenue grew plus 15.8% with strong volume mix growth in North America, Latin America, and EMEA. Overall volume mix was flat for the quarter, despite the expected customer disruption in Europe. Recall last year's Q2 total company volume mix was plus 5%, making this performance even more impressive. Emerging markets grew more than 23%, with strong performance across significant numbers of markets. While developed markets grew 11% with balanced strength from both North America and Europe and despite customer disruption. Turning to portfolio performance on slide 12. Chocolates, Biscuits, Gum and Candy businesses all posted another quarter of double-digit increases in Q2. Biscuits increased plus 13.9%. Oreo, Ritz, Chips Ahoy!, Give & Go, TUC and Club Social all deliver double-digit growth. Clif though not inorganic also posted strong growth. Chocolate grew plus 13.7% with strength in both developed and emerging markets. Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka, Lacta, Toblerone all delivered double-digit increases. We are very pleased with the performance of our core categories of chocolate and biscuits which albeit impacted in the quarter by customer disruption are on a solid trajectory. For both we expect good volume momentum as we move forward in the year now that negotiations in Europe are behind us. Gum and Candy grew more than 30% with trends across our business units especially in emerging markets. Now let's review market and share performance on slide 13. We held or gained share in 70% of our revenue base. The US continues to make service-level improvements and ended Q2 with good on-shelf availability and inventory levels. Moving to page 14. We deliver more than $540 million in gross profit growth or 20% in Q2 driven by top-line productivity and cost discipline. This also resulted in year-over-year gross margin expansion in all regions except Europe, which was impacted by expected customer disruption. Now that pricing is implemented, we expect improvements in Europe too. This growth provides significant fuel to invest behind our brands as well as significant earnings flow through. Moving to regional performance on slide 15. We delivered double-digit revenue growth in all regions, while also delivering volume mix increases in all regions, but Europe that got impacted by pricing-related disruption. This growth translated into operating leverage, NOI dollar growth across the board. Europe grew plus 13.1% with double-digit OI growth. Importantly, pricing has now been lending and we expect that this will lead to a better second half volume and margin performance. Overall, the consumer remains resilient with elasticity is holding up relatively well in chocolate and biscuit, while we saw some incremental elasticity in part of our cheese and grocery business. North America grew plus 12.4% with OI dollar growth of more than 29%, driven by higher pricing, volume mix of 2% and strength from both our base Biscuits business and our ventures, such as Give & Go, Perfect Snacks and Clif. Clif also posted robust growth and deliver another operating margin increase of double-digit percentage points in Q2 versus last year. Now profitability is approaching the level of total North America, but we still have to generate material synergies both on revenue and cost line. So Clif is a business that is growing as now some margins and still with meaningful synergy potential. AMEA grew 13.2% with solid volume mix growth of more than 3%, while dollars increased plus 4.2%. India, China, Southeast Asia, all posted strong top-line growth for the quarter. Latin America grew more than 37% with OI dollar growth of nearly 65%. Mexico, Western Andean countries and Brazil, all turned in robust quarters. Ricolino remains on track in terms of integration, and we expect to begin capturing more benefits towards the end of the year. Next to EPS on slide 16. In the quarter, EPS grew plus 21.5% in constant currency or nearly 17% at reported dollars. Turning to slide 17. Free cash flow was $1.5 billion in the first half with $1.7 billion in return of capital to shareholders. We also announced today an increase in our dividends of plus 10%, marking a double-digit increase in eight of the last nine years of the history of Mondelez. Turning to our outlook on page 19. Given the strength of our Q2 and first half performance the successful conclusion of our negotiations in Europe, the strong volume momentum of our brands, we are raising our full year outlook for both revenue growth and adjusted EPS. We now expect top-line growth of 12% plus versus our original outlook of 5% to 7% and most recent outlook of 10% plus. EPS growth is also expected to be 12% plus versus our prior outlook of 10% plus and the original outlook of high single-digits. Note, our free cash flow outlook remains unchanged at $3.3 billion, given $400 million in cash taxes related to the sell-down and exit of our KDP position. In terms of key assumptions we continue to expect a double-digit inflation increase for '23, driven by elevated cost in packaging ingredients, labor and lapping favorable commodity hedges in 2022. With respect to interest expense, we now expect $380 million for the year, given recent coffee asset monetization and term-loan reductions. We also expect to end the year around mid-twos in terms of leverage, based on current conditions. As a reminder, given the liquidation of our KDP position in mid-July there will be no dividend income recorded enough to. We now expect $0.11 of EPS of headwinds related to ForEx impact for the year versus $0.09 in our prior outlook. The outlook revision reflects our increased confidence in the year. Ongoing resilience of consumer consumption in our categories, relatively benign elasticities, continued brand reinvestments, and completion of pricing in Europe as well as health of our emerging markets. This current outlook does not consider a material deterioration of geopolitical environment surrounding some areas of our business. With that, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Your line is open. Andrew Lazar : Great. Thanks so much. Appreciate it. First off, Dirk, we've heard so far from a bunch of food companies that have reported earnings of some, maybe very recent changes in things like consumer behavior, retailer inventory destocking, competitiveness, and maybe generally greater sluggishness in category volumes as pricing has lapped. I was hoping you could talk a bit about the landscape as it relates to Mondelez specifically. And any changes sort of one way or the other that are notable for you? Dirk Van de Put : Okay. Thanks, Andrew. Well, and based on H1, we obviously feel quite good about how our portfolio is performing. We have brought growth in the different regions, in the different categories across most of our brands. The pricing went through quite well, strong pricing, I would say compared to others. We have very good volume mix growth in three out of four regions. And the only region that was disrupted was Europe, but that was due to customer disruption, and we foresee for the second half that we will see solid volume growth in Europe. Our share is increasing, North America is finally recovered. We are gaining share in AMEA. Europe, of course, still a bit of a drag on share, but that's again because of this client disruption. You'll see that our emerging markets are doing quite well, broadly in the top and the bottom-line. So we are generating good gross profit. So we can continue to invest strongly in our brands and in our capabilities. The acquisitions are doing well, I would point to Clif. And yeah we have double-digit growth in adjusted and really PSO. The whole picture for us, looks pretty good. If I look a little bit further on the environment at least in our categories, we see strong consumer confidence. We would say that it's improving in the developed and in the emerging markets and the price sensitivity seems to be plateauing, particularly the emerging market consumer, I would say, is very, very solid. If I think about the competition, I think the big difference between us and the competition will be that we have a very strong top-line combined with some good volume growth and promo levels, we see some increase in promo levels in Biscuit, but it's largely flat and down somewhere else. We even see promo prices going up faster than non-promo prices in percentage. From a pricing perspective, we have done as what was needed. So most of our '23 pricing is taken. North America was already done in December of last year. Europe was closed, in line with expectations in Q2 and emerging markets are exactly on plan. And then the elasticity, we don't see a change in the elasticity, which has been low, as you know. We do see consumers shopping around more, hoping to find deals. The quantity bag per shopping trip is the same, but they tend to shop a little bit less frequently, but nothing really that preoccupies us. And so to close, I would say, the volume is strong. Europe will recover in the second half, and this will be the strongest H1. And we believe here that we have delivered as Mondelez. So we think we are quite -- doing quite well there. Maybe a few words on Europe, which is probably the most important thing for us. It obviously has been, for us, a very dynamic environment. Top line demand has been quite good, 13.1% growth, but the volume/mix was down 4.5 points, but that was due primarily through that client disruption. I want to reemphasize that all 2023 clients negotiations have closed successfully and all the pricing was landed in line with plan. We will see some inflationary costs continuing in cocoa and sugar going into 2024. And we are planning to do some strong investments in the second half in Europe. So if you think that through and you say, okay, these pricing negotiations are behind us, we are positive on H2. And so what you could expect for H2 in Europe is that our volumes will grow. We are ready to execute in store. We have planned key promotions because now with this negotiation behind us, we can go full force again. I think as a consequence of that, you will see our share improve. We also start lapping prior year headwinds. And our margins will start to recover as the pricing is now fully implemented. So I think three levels of good news, volume, share and margins. Our categories continue to do well. Consumers seem to prioritize them. Also in Europe, elasticities remain low despite some strong price inflation. Yes, if you talk about our cheese or grocery categories, there we see a little bit of an uptick in elasticity, but that's a smaller percentage of our business. HFS in the UK looks pretty manageable at this stage. The consumer is adjusting to the changes that they see in store. We see a bigger impact on seasonal and gifting, but the impact on standard chocolate seems to be minor. So I would say the main news that we have is that we are expecting a good second half for Europe on top of all the other things. Hope that gives you a picture, Andrew. Andrew Lazar : Yes. No, really, really complete. So I appreciate that. One very quick one for Luca. The company raised constant currency EPS growth expectations to 12% plus from 10 plus. I guess consensus is already relatively close to the 12% mark. So I guess I'm just curious how investors should think about the plus in the guide. Thanks so much. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Andrew. Yes. Before I go to the plus part, maybe briefly to provide some color on what underpins the new outlook. I think there are three important drivers to point to in terms of our new outlook. One, it is clearly the strong first half. And importantly, the quality of the results we are posting. I'm particularly happy with the operating part of the EPS growth. Second, I think it is really the underlying broad-based trends of our business, the resilience of our brands. I'm happy with volume and value growth and the continued investment. And third, as we mentioned a few times, Europe with price fully lending and in line with expectations. So maybe a word briefly by geography. Emerging markets are on a roll. We are quite happy. Some pricing is causing some areas of concern in terms of elasticity, but those are the minority of the market and not really important in the big scheme of things. The US and North America are posting a terrific P&L, and we are very pleased with Clif. And Europe has improved profitability already in Q2. But as we said last quarter, at that time, we had 80% of the price implemented. Now that pricing is 100% secured, we expect volume and revenue growth as well as margin improvement for Europe. So quite frankly, there is a good chance that we exceed the 12% plus guidance, but I prefer having another quarter under the belt and then narrow guidance for Q4. If all things play out as we have in mind, as I said, there are good chances we will exceed the guidance. Bear in mind that we want to start 2024 strong. And so if there is upside in terms of profitability and EPS, we might decide to reinvest selectively some of the upside to get really a fast start into 2024, too. Andrew Lazar : Thanks so much. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Andrew. Operator : Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Your line is open. Bryan Spillane : Hey, thanks, operator. Good afternoon, guys. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, Brian. Luca Zaramella : Hi, Brian. Bryan Spillane : Hey, I got two questions, one on the net interest guidance and the second one on Clif. So maybe first one for you, Luca. Net interest expense guidance came down again I think by about $20 million versus where we were coming out of 1Q. And I just want to make sure, I think you paid off a $750 million term loan with the KDP proceeds. So is this just simply a function of half a year interest savings on paying the term loan off? Or is there anything else that drove the lower net interest expense? Luca Zaramella : No, that is it. It is debt coming down. You're going to see a good leverage as we end the year. We plan to be at like 2.5 times debt, which is quite good. And yes, it is as simple as us paying down the term loan. Bryan Spillane : Okay. Thanks. And then, Dirk, in your prepared comments, you talked about Clif pretty encouragingly, right, in terms of the margins approaching, I guess, the segment level and then there's more synergy. And then it sounds like you're also expanding on revenue. So can you just maybe give us a little bit of a progress report on kind of where you stand with Clif today relative to where it was when you acquired it? Is your integration and is the acquisition model kind of running ahead of expectations? And just how we should think about maybe how impactful Clif might be as we look forward? Dirk Van de Put : Yes. So we've seen in the first half, very strong double-digit revenue growth. And the margins, the OI margin versus previous year is up more than 1,000 basis points. So we've increased prices, some of the first thing I would say. We've increased prices more aggressively than Clif would have done historically. We increased prices in August, in January and another one later in Q1. And so we see low elasticity, I would say. So that's having a big impact. The second big thing that we are doing is the service has improved. We reduced SKUs. And we started to operate the plants a little bit better. And so that has given to a good increase in the service level. Then we changed the promotional plan. That has successfully kicked off. Fourth thing is that our media buying is more efficient than theirs. So we were able to also get some benefits from that. So those are some of the things we've done. The integration is taking place in a number of steps, like a big one is the systems integration later on in the year. But so far, where we have streamlined the teams and we've brought more clarity on how we want to operate the business that is all going well. But as we said in the prepared remarks that the real benefit of the cost synergies is still largely to come. We've already seen some benefits, but it's in the second half of this year and beginning of next year that we will get the real benefit from it. So I would say you can probably make the calculation. It's close to a $1 billion business. That improves its margin by the amount that I was closing. So that will have a reasonable impact on the total company. Bryan Spillane : Thanks, Dirk. Thanks, Luca. Luca Zaramella : Thank you. Thank you, Bryan. Operator : Our next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Palmer : Thank you. A question on Europe pricing and the impact on volume. You mentioned the pricing is complete. How are you thinking about the volume for that region in the second half given that some of that disruption is behind you and you're lapping some disruption in the second half versus '22? Dirk Van de Put : Yes. So as I said, we don't really give volume guidance per region, but we would see some solid volume growth in the second half driven by exactly the factors that you were saying. So we have the pricing negotiations behind us, that pricing will be implemented. The disruption is gone. Last year, in the second half, we increased our prices in Europe, and we had more disruption. We will lap that. So that's going to have a benefit for us. We have elasticities in Europe that are relatively benign. So despite the newly implemented pricing, we don't think that, that's going to have a major effect on the volume. So we're not giving you the number, it's going to be a nice solid volume growth for the second half. David Palmer : And then I couldn't help but notice you featured cake and pastries a couple of times in your slides. And it seems like a logical extension to have Oreo have a snack cake. But I wonder how big could your aspirations be in that category. It doesn't seem as big as some of your other categories. So I'm wondering, do you see snack cakes and pastries being an ongoing sizable growth contributor? And maybe give us a sense of how you think about the TAM there, the opportunity there and how you're going to go about it. Thanks. Dirk Van de Put : Yes. So well, first of all, cakes and pastries is not a small category. It's not the size of biscuits, but it's not too far away from it. And so it's a big opportunity around the world. It's a very fragmented category with sometimes relatively commoditized products in there. But there is a real opportunity to bring strong brands with high-quality products. And so that's really the play that we're going forward through an Oreo Airy Cake in China or Cakesters here in the US or Give & Go in the fresh section or a Chipita in Europe with pre-packaged croissants for instance. So we think that there is a whole play for us there. At the moment, we're around the 3%, 4% market share of the whole category. So plenty of room to go. With that, we are already the number two player. And so that indicates how fragmented it is. The category itself has been growing quite nicely over the past three years. It is a category that exists across all markets. It covers different occasions than our typical biscuits and chocolate, so that makes it very interesting for them. And so we think with these new quality products and our brands, we can really make a significant impact. And I'm not going to give an exact number, but we would expect that our cake and pastry business in the coming year should double or triple and lift us up to close to a 10% market share. So for us, it's going to be a significant contribution to the growth of the company. David Palmer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Kenneth Goldman : Hi. Thank you. I wanted to ask, as we look at the future charts for cocoa and sugar, you might indicate that theoretically, right, down the road, some additional pricing might be needed to offset more inflation. I appreciate you're not in a position today, right, to talk about pricing that hasn't been announced. But just conceptually, is there any reason to think that you wouldn't be able or willing to if needed, raise list prices again, especially if European elasticities, I guess, maybe aren't that bad and you're -- given your commentary about some improve or improving consumer confidence. Thanks. Luca Zaramella : Thank you for the question, Ken. Look, the increase in sugar and cocoa specifically is material. I mean, we are talking about most likely a 30-plus percent if you look at the last 12 months or even more, particularly in cocoa. I think when you look at the quality of the brands, we said the fact that we had invested materially around the world in our brands, the fact that there are strong bonds with consumers and I believe pricing is -- will be a necessity in chocolate. I'm not going to elaborate on the details. Also, bear in mind that particularly in emerging markets, we are going to be very mindful about not vacating price point. And so we will use RGM. And then over the last couple of years, I would say we have learned the ins and outs of implementing pricing around the world. And I think it is needed, and we're going to do it most likely. Kenneth Goldman : Thanks. And then just one quick follow-up. Are there any peculiarities or cadence issues we should think about that are not necessarily obvious? Just as we model 3Q versus 4Q, any timing or headwinds or tailwinds that might not be apparent at first glance, if I could say. Thank you. Luca Zaramella : No. Look, I don't think there is anything that you're going to see in terms of outliers that are going to cause material issues or material opportunities in Q3. You're going to see a volume rebound in Europe. As a consequence, I think, obviously, there is going to be a better situation for the totality of the company. I'm not going to guide you exactly on gross profit. But you're going to see double-digit, most likely revenue growth and double-digit EBIT growth. Below the line, the items can vary. But I think when you really look at Q3, Q4, you're going to see strong operating gains coming through the P&L. And I didn't talk a lot about cash flow, but very happy with that, too. And you're going to see us delivering the cash flow despite the $400 million headwind related to the coffee KDP sales. Kenneth Goldman : Thank you. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Ken. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Christopher Carey : Hey, everyone. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, Chris. Christopher Carey : So just one follow-up and then just a second question around the guidance commentary. But Luca, I think you said that you expected leverage at the end of the year to be in the 2.5 times range. That would be a historically low level for the company. At that level, how should we be thinking about deployment of capital at that point? You repurchase more shares. You have too many deals recently. And clearly, you're doing great work on Clif. So is there low-hanging fruit on what you've already added? It just stood out to me that you'll be trending toward a historically low level of leverage. And at that point, I think there's going to be probably some observations around what that capacity could be used for. And then just one other quick follow-up on the EPS upside comment for the full year. There was also a comment just around spending back, right? So like how do you think about, as we get through the year, this concept, okay, there could be some upside, but you're also quite committed to the spending back. Like where does that kind of tension play out, right? Volumes get weaker, you're going to spend back more. If not, there's some upside, just maybe any context on that as well. So thanks for that on the leverage and just upside versus investment. Thanks so much. Luca Zaramella : Yes. No, I think the first thing first is the underlying strength of the EBITDA in the business. So we are converting cash quite well from net income that is coming. And that is the first element of the equation. The second one is the fact that we are going to get $1.3 plus billion of proceeds from the gum sale, and that will further enhance the situation. I'm not going to tell you that we are going to run the company forever at this level of leverage. But reality is, absent M&A I think this is most likely a little bit of a new norm. What you have also to keep in mind is both in the case of Clif and Ricolino, we are doing quite a good job in terms of integration. And I think deployment of capital behind M&A, particularly, has been something that the company has done well. Capital allocation behind fleet, we quoted a few numbers. I think this is a great opportunity, and it shows that we can generate quite a bit of value through M&A. We don't control necessarily time of M&A. But on the M&A, if something comes along, we're going to be on it. Also, bear in mind that there are parts of the portfolio that we might decide eventually to divest down the road. So I think from a leverage standpoint, we are really in a good shape. The EPS upside, the -- one of the things I believe that is delivering volume growth for us, it is the fact that, yes, we price, but we continue to invest in the business, not only in terms of A&C, but also quality and other things. We talked a little bit earlier in the year about the mill carry launch in Europe and the improved formula as one example. And what I meant by EPS upside is we clearly have in mind the fact that we might have a little bit of headroom in terms of profitability. And we want to use a little bit of that headroom selectively in some places to really go after incremental distribution opportunities, to really go after incremental investments such as we get a good start into 2024. It will be on a case by case, but we consistently ask around the business, do you have opportunities to accelerate. And we do it on a quarterly basis, and so stay tuned. You'll learn more as we post Q3 results. Christopher Carey : Okay. Thanks so much. Luca Zaramella : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Jason English : Hey, folks. Thanks for calling me in. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, Jason. Jason English : Look, I want to pull on that thread you just brought up, the opportunity to drive accelerating growth, invest, find distribution. I believe in the past, you've outlined some of the distribution opportunities you see in front of you in Brazil and Southeast Asia and India as well as the opportunity that's coming on the back of the Ricolino acquisition. Can you update us something on where those opportunities lie, how much progress you've made and how much progress is supposed to be had? Dirk Van de Put : Yes. The opportunities typically lie in the emerging markets in the first place. And so the countries that you should be thinking about are India and China where we have been going at the rate of well over 100,000 to 200,000 new stores every year. That is going to continue, that speed at which we continue to grow. We do the same in Southeast Asia, and we're also looking at opportunities to do something similar in Latin America. So that's the number 1 driver of what we think. And you should think about it at the same pace as what it has been in the last two, three years. The second one is, we call it going broader, which means that we can start to increase the range of our products that are available in stores, also, again, largely in emerging markets. That's another big driver of our distribution. China has started to do that in the last two, three years. And that's going pretty well for us. And so that's a second sort of front that we are working on around the world. And then the last one is the acquisitions where we are starting to do test and learn with these products in different markets around the world. So we have a number of tests and learns going on in Chipita. We have some Grenade test and learn. We will have some Clif test and learns around the world. And we are expecting that from that, we will learn which countries those would have a big opportunity to start being distributed. So that you should see as a third front. In the first two, three years, I wouldn't expect that you would see a major impact on our numbers. But later on, as these things take shape, I think that will start to play a significant role. If I think order of magnitude that you should think about it, if I think about in India or in China, I would say 1/3 of the growth is driven by distribution expansion. So that gives you an order of magnitude. Jason English : Powerful stuff. I appreciate it. I'll pass it on. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Jason Operator : Our next question comes from John Baumgartner with Mizuho Securities. Your line is open. John Baumgartner : Good afternoon. Thanks for the questions. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, John. John Baumgartner : Hi, I wanted to stick with the emerging markets, but maybe in the context of local brands. It looks as though the market share growth has stalled out a bit in the last couple of quarters, at least in Europe. And maybe that's a function of the success of global brands sort of crowding out the locals. But if you could elaborate there, just on your resource allocation, where you are at this point, what are the expectations for locals across the portfolio going forward? And how you think about the ability for global and local to grow share simultaneously? Because I think historically, the largest opportunities you have to recover lost share in locals is Eastern Europe, Asia, chocolate biscuits. So curious about your thoughts there. Thank you. Dirk Van de Put : Yes. So well, first of all, I would say Europe, you have to be a bit careful because you have the whole client disruption going through there. So if our share is affected, that has to see with the client disruption. But if I think about the performance of global and local brands, it is true that global brands have started to grow faster, I would say. We have a number of brands, particularly an Oreo, Milka, Cadbury, but also Dryden as a gum brand for example, or Halls, which are recuperating post COVID. So you have a number of global brands who -- the Oreo and Milka category is normal, but then you get an extra boost from things like Trident and Halls, which were not growing that much. We, for instance, are also working very hard on our Toblerone premiumization. So yes, at this stage, global brands are growing faster. They're well into the 20s. While local jewels are probably more in the mid-teens growth, still not bad. But that's a little bit the effect, as I explained to you. Does that mean that we have changed our resource allocation? No, not at all. And if anything, we're pushing our local teams to make sure that our local jewels get significant resources allocated to it because we believe that the opportunity is there. And so I wouldn't read too much into it. For instance, if you look at the 4-year CAGR, our global brands are double digits while our local jewels are high single digits. So very close to each other. And that's really what I point to. So we don't necessarily see anything there that would preoccupy us. John Baumgartner : Thank you, Dirk. Dirk Van de Put : Okay. Luca Zaramella : Thank you. Operator : Our last question comes from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Michael Lavery : Thank you. Good afternoon . I just wanted to follow up Dave Palmer's question about bakery. And maybe specifically, just with Give & Go, you mentioned how bringing branded and quality products was sort of the key to unlocking share gains and growth there. But fresh seems less branded and maybe sometimes very little branding. Is it opportunity there? How much can you push that maybe in certain sub-segments? And then as far as geographically explaining that, is there an opportunity for that as well? Dirk Van de Put : Yes. Well, yes, when I talked about the branded part, I was talking more about the packaged cakes and pastries. And so if you think about Give & Go as a fresh business, branded can play a role, and I can explain you a little bit how we think about that. But it's largely driven through innovation, I would say, the growth of the Give & Go business and extra distribution. So you have to think about Give & Go as a player that makes mini cakes and pastries, so mini cupcakes, mini muffins, mini brownies, mini doughnuts. And that's a very interesting segment. It's a to-buy segment, and they do a great job in offering a quality product. We can make those products with some of our ingredients. So you can imagine a cupcake with Oreo on top of it. And so the branding can play a role. They've also started to develop their own brands. So it can play a role in Give & Go, but your observation is correct that it's more in the packaged part of things. Now the in-store bakery is very interesting for retailers in North America, but it's also happening in other parts of the world. We were in Australia, for instance, and one of the retailers there, their main interest was to talk to us about in-store bakery and how we could activate it together with them. The reason being that the other big benefit of Give & Go business is that it saves on labor. So you now get a product delivered to your store that is freeze and thaw, and you can avoid all the labor in store, and so that drives a big interest from the retailer on top. The consumer sees it as fresh. There is high interest. It's a section they want to increase. So I would certainly confirm that there is a growing interest around the world for fresh bakery. Michael Lavery : That's great color. And just a follow-up on emerging markets, too. It sounds like there's strength broadly even in China. But can you just help us understand the Chinese consumer a little bit? Is your performance there doing well a function of a relatively low kind of accessible price point? Is it more food at home that's doing well? Can you just maybe unpack a little bit where the Chinese consumer is and how that fits with your portfolio? Dirk Van de Put : Yes, yes. So China grew double digit for us in Q2. One of the key effects that you need to think about is that we have a big gum business there. And as we are coming out of COVID, kind of strange. Nobody talks about COVID anymore in China, but the mobility is coming back, and so we have growth coming on our gum business. And on top of that, we have had a continued strong biscuit growth, which is more home consumption. In both cases, we are increasing our share. Biscuit is up almost 1 point in Q2 through very strong brand activations, and we're particularly happy with the success that Chips Ahoy! is having now as our second big biscuit brand next to Oreo in China. And then gum share is up 2.5 points, where we started to do some very targeted activations in lower-tier cities. The other thing that's particular about Chinese that digital commerce is about 20% of sales. And in Q2, digital commerce is starting to -- started to grow quite considerably at a 23% growth rate. So that all points towards on-the-go consumption because in China, digital commerce can be sometimes delivered in a very short period of time, but also home consumption offshore -- of course. The other thing to explain our China growth is that distribution expansion I was talking about in the previous question. So in Q2 alone, we've added 60,000 new stores in the super and mini channels as a part of that go deeper route-to-market strategy. And the last one I would point to is innovation. We launched that Oreo Airy Cake. I talked about it in the prepared remarks. And that's that expansion into baked snacks and cakes and pastries for us. So those are all the elements that are driving our Chinese growth. I think it's pretty solid for the quarters and years to come. We can work on all these fronts. We can continue to add distribution. We still have a huge opportunity. We have some interesting innovations coming up. We're getting better and better on our digital commerce. And I think the gum category will really rebound in the coming months, and that will be a boost to our growth there. As it relates to the consumer, the consumer is clearly -- the confidence is going up. But certainly, they are not yet to the bullishness that they had pre-pandemic. They're not cutting back on volumes, but they are clearly shopping around more, trying to find better deals, and they're also trading up and down as it relates to the pack size. We also see a shift to smaller stores because the quantity that they buy is smaller and they shop with more frequency. So I would say we are very encouraged by our China business. We have several fronts that allow us to grow. We've done that in the previous years. Those fronts have not been affected. And I believe that you will see some very good results coming from China in the second half of the year. Michael Lavery : That's great color. Thanks so much. Michael Lavery : Okay. Well, thank you. With that, I think we can conclude the call for the second quarter. Thank you so much for assisting and thank you for the confidence in the company. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, everyone. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation, and you may disconnect at any time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day and welcome to the Mondelez International Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Mondelez management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondelez. Please go ahead, sir. Shep Dunlap : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO; and Luca Zaramella, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. As we discuss our results today, unless noted as reported, we'll be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures, which adjust for certain items included in our GAAP results. In addition, we provide our year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. You can find the comparable GAAP measures and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation. Today, Dirk will provide a business and strategy update followed by a review of our financial results and outlook by Luca. We will close with Q&A. I'll now turn the call over to Dirk. Dirk Van de Put : Thanks, Shep, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. I will start on slide four. Our strong third quarter results and our prospects for the future confirm that we are positioned for high-quality, sustainable growth. We remain confident in the durability of our categories, the strength of our iconic brands and the consistency of our execution. We delivered strong profitable volume growth with a healthy share performance. All our geographic regions grew double-digits in both revenue and profitability. To manage cost inflation and enable robust reinvestments, we continue to leverage our RGM capabilities. RGM is an area where we believe there is significant room to do more over the next several years. We continue to reshape our portfolio to focus on our core categories of chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks with the successful divestiture of our developed market gum business, generating additional reinvestment opportunities. Our strong year-to-date performance, the continued strength of our categories and our ongoing focus on strong commercial plans and execution provide the confidence to again raise both our organic net revenue outlook to 14% to 15% and adjusted EPS growth outlook to approximately 16%. Turning to slide five. You can see that in the third quarter, we delivered both top and bottom line strength, enabling us to continue substantial reinvestment in our brands. We delivered organic net revenue growth of 15.7% for the quarter. Year-to-date revenue is up 17%, nearly $4 billion ahead of last year. We also delivered adjusted gross profit dollar growth of 22.3% for the quarter. Again, we are ahead of last year's pace with 20% growth year-to-date, up $1.7 billion. The strong performance enables us to reinvest in our brands and capabilities to drive attractive growth in future periods. Our A&C investment is up 28.5% for the quarter and 21.5% for the year, which demonstrates our commitment to continue to build the strength of our brands. These results translated into strong adjusted OI growth, up 24.5% for the quarter and close to $900 million for the year. As you can see on slide six, our third quarter growth was driven by strong volume/mix, up nearly four points. We are especially pleased that our European pricing actions, which were implemented earlier this year are successfully behind us. We view this quarter strong volume/mix performance as evidence that we are taking the right actions to continue delivering sustainable growth and share gains. Consumers continue to choose our trusted and beloved brands, despite significant pricing due to ongoing inflation. More broadly, we view our strong performance in the third quarter as evidence that our long-term strategy continues to pay off. Since the launch of our growth plan in 2018, we have consistently delivered gross profit dollar growth, which allowed for a virtuous cycle of yearly increasing high-return investments. We remain confident that this strategy will continue to consistently deliver attractive growth. Turning to slide seven. We continue to see evidence that consumer demand for our snacking categories remains resilient and that consumers continue to prefer our widely loved brands over private label alternatives. In North America, the biscuit category is experiencing some softness in scanner data, most notably among lower-income families. However, I would note that these families are increasing their purchases in the non-measured club store channel. Our total US biscuits volume was up more than 3% in Q3, showcasing the continued strength of our brands and investments in both measured and non-measured channels. We are seeing particularly strong growth in unmeasured channels like club stores, e-commerce and food service. Meanwhile, in Europe, consumer confidence is improving with a significant step-up versus 2022 and remains broadly stable throughout Q3. We're seeing positive volume growth in biscuits and chocolates, which has accelerated over the last three months and is outpacing broader food driven by solid elasticities and lapping of 2022 disruptions. In Q3, our European chocolate and biscuit business delivered solid volume growth of 2.6%, which again shows the resilience of our categories and the strength of our brands. In emerging markets, consumer confidence remains strong. We continue to see resilient underlying demand and lower price sensitivity than in developed markets. During Q3, we delivered strong growth in terms of both volume and value at 4% and 24%, respectively. And we are confident that we have strong opportunities to continue to drive expanded distribution and creating new snacking occasions. On slide eight, you can see a few examples of our growth acceleration strategy in action. We continue to invest in our brands and connect closely with consumers to stay in line with changing consumer tastes and snacking occasions. We are also driving growth in a broader range of channels while accelerating our focus on premium segments and harnessing the power of recent acquisitions to advance geographic expansion. For example, Oreo continues to grow its strong position as the world's favourite cookie, and its share performance here in North America has grown nicely. Our recent partnership with Super Mario Brothers executed both online and in-store is just one example of the many creative campaigns that leverage personalization and local relevance to reinforce the brand's playful persona. Along with continuous reinvestment in our brands, we are also investing in growth channels. For example, our belVita business is up nearly a full share point in the US club channel, driven by growing shopper interest in convenience, tasty and better-for-you options for morning snacking on-the-go. Sold in individual portion packs and delivering more than 14 grams of whole grains per serving. belVita offers a great solution for consumers who are too busy to eat a traditional breakfast. We're continuing to grow this business with a new customized and digitally targeted social and digital media campaign celebrating the ritual of belVita and coffee in the morning. Another important element of our growth strategy is investing in the fast-growing premium chocolate space. We have re-launched Toblerone with a robust campaign inspired by luxury fashion brand, positioning it as a jewel. We're supporting this launch with a strengthened brand persona, Never Square and substantial investments in A&C. Bringing this dual concept to life, our new pralines called Toblerone Truffles recently debuted in the United Kingdom, Switzerland and Australia as well as airport duty-free stores in key markets. They will expand to additional markets next year. Finally, we continue driving geographic expansion of our recently acquired brands. For example, Ricolino headquartered in Mexico is now the number one hispanic confectionery brand in the United States, growing well and in line with our expectations. Turning to slide nine. Let's zoom in closer on the snack bar business to highlight the strong progress. We're excited about the opportunities in this space, and we believe there is significant runway ahead led by the strong and growing brands of Clif Bar, Grenade and Perfect Snacks. We expect our snack bar business to exceed $1.2 billion net revenue this year. Let's start with Clif, where we are excited about our current results and the long-term opportunity to broaden distribution, expand into new formats and increase our geographical reach. Year-to-date, Clif is up double-digit in top line growth. And within that, the Clif Kid Zbar has been a particular standout. Zbar is a delicious organic non-GMO soft-baked, whole grain energy snack for kids with zero transfat or artificial flavors. Zbar is growing at twice the rate of the total bars category with consumption dollar growth up 19% versus last year. Grenade also continues to exceed our expectations. Grenade is performing very well in the sports nutrition space with signature bars that are high in protein and low in sugar. Since our acquisition a bit more than two years ago, we have doubled the business, thanks to strong core growth in the UK and distribution expansion in Ireland, Nordics and the Benelux. Perfect Snacks also is experiencing continued double-digit value growth, strengthening its position as the number one refrigerated protein bar in the United States. We have a great portfolio and strong conviction in the growth potential of our snack bar business and we will continue investing to drive leadership in the segment. Turning to slide 10. I'd like to take a moment to share progress on an important element of our sustainability strategy. Just two years after joining the science-based target initiative, net zero carbon emission, we have submitted a time-bound plan laying out how we aim to achieve our target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions across our full value chain by 2050. To reach this critical milestone, we have completed a detailed process of re-baselining providing documentation of our carbon accounting and aligning to new standards. Putting this plan into action in the near term, we are making solid progress towards our 2025 goal of reducing end-to-end carbon emissions by 10%. We are working hard to transform our business operations and supply chains. Over the past two years, we have scaled regenerative agriculture practices across our signature sourcing programs for coco and wheat, achieved renewable energy at manufacturing sites across every region and reduced CO2 emissions through plant and logistical efficiencies. We continue to believe that helping to drive positive change at scale, including through reducing our climate impact, is an integral part of value creation with positive returns for our stakeholders. We encourage you to read our Snacking Made Right report for additional details and context on our broader sustainability goals and progress. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca to share additional insights on our financials. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Dirk, and good afternoon. Q3 was strong all across our business, with high-quality top and bottom line growth, healthy volume mix, record profit dollar increases and substantial brand reinvestment. We delivered double-digit organic net revenue of 15.7% with growth across each region, underpinned by volume mix of almost 4% as well as by some pricing of around 12%. Our business is proving to be resilient, both in emerging markets, which grew 19%, with strong performance virtually everywhere, and in developed markets, which grew more than 13% with balanced trends from both North America and in Europe. Turning to portfolio performance on slide 13. Our chocolate, biscuits, gum and candy businesses, all posted double-digit increases in Q3. Biscuit increased plus 12.4%. Oreo, LU, Biscuit, TUC, 7Days and Clif delivered double-digit growth and robust volumes. Chocolate grew plus 14.9%, with double-digit growth in both developed and emerging markets. Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka, Toblerone and Lacta all posted double-digit increases. Gum and candy grew more than 30%, with particular strength coming from emerging markets. Now let's review market and share performance on slide 14. We held or gained share in 65% of our revenue base, driven by brand building investments as well as solid North America supply chain performance and strong sales execution, particularly in emerging markets. Moving to regional performance on slide 15. As far as Q3 goals, we delivered double-digit revenue growth in every single region, with a significant contribution from healthy volume/mix growth, including Europe, which has rebounded after lending pricing this summer and is now in a much stronger position. This robust growth and volume performance translated into operating leverage across the business. Notwithstanding material marketing investment, profit growth delivery has been very strong in all regions. Europe grew plus 15.4%, with nearly 30% OI growth that was driven by pricing and volume/mix. Top line strength was broad-based with the UK, Germany and France, among those posted strong results. Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka, Oreo, 7Days and Grenade were among brands with double-digit growth. European elasticities remained stable in both chocolate and biscuits. North America grew plus 11.4%, with OI dollar growth of more than 24%, driven by higher pricing and volume/mix growth of 4.6%. Oreo, Clif, Tate's and Sour Patch, all grew double-digits, while Ritz and belVita posted high single-digit increases in the quarter. Profitability in the base business remained strong, while acquired businesses, such as Clif and Tate's, posted strong double-digit profit dollar growth. This is an important proof point showing how accretive our M&A agenda can be. Clif profitability continues to improve. And as I said last quarter, we still have some synergies opportunities as we have now integrated the platform into SAP. AMEA grew plus 11.9%, with volume/mix growth of more than 3%. OI dollars increased plus 18.1%. India and Australia grew double-digits, while China increased high single-digits in the quarter. Latin America grew more than 35% with OI dollar growth of nearly plus 37%. LA top line grew more than 16%, ex Argentina. Mexico to Western Andean countries and Brazil, once again delivered great results. Ricolino grew high single-digits and remains on track in terms of integration work. Moving to page 16. We delivered nearly $650 million in gross profit dollar growth or more than 22%, driven by top line growth, volume leverage and productivity. Year-to-date, GP dollar growth is now more than $1.7 billion. This provides ample funding to reinvest for future growth and flow to the net earnings line. OI dollar growth was more than $300 million for the quarter or up more than 24% versus last year, driven by solid cost discipline, effective pricing and volume leverage. Year-to-date, OI dollars have grown $880 million or almost 24%. EPS on slide 17. Year-to-date, EPS grew more than 18% in constant currency or more than 13% reported dollars, driven primarily by strong operating gains. Turning to slide 18. Free cash flow is $2.4 billion year-to-date, which represents an increase of $0.5 billion year-over-year. Year-to-date, capital return is $2.2 billion. Moving to our outlook on page 20. Given the strength of our Q3 and year-to-date performance, strong volume/mix momentum across our brands and overall demand resilience, we are now raising our full year outlook for both revenue and EPS. We now expect top line growth of 14% to 15% versus our original outlook of 5% to 7% and most recent outlook of 12% plus. EPS growth is also expected to be approximately 16% versus our prior outlook of 12% plus and original outlook of high single-digit. In terms of the assumptions, no change to our double-digit inflation. We also expect interest expenses of approximately $325 million for the year. Leverage is expected to be in the mid to upper 2s range by year-end. With respect to currency, we now expect $0.15 of EPS headwinds related to ForEx impact for the year versus $0.11 in our prior outlook, of which $0.12 have been materialized already in the year-to-date. On the gum divestiture that became effective as of the beginning of October, this current outlook reflects the loss of the business for the entirety of Q4. We are not providing yet restated financials as teams are working through the definition of the impact and importantly, the removal of stranded costs. While we will provide a full update in the next earnings cycle, we do not expect any material EPS dilution as we will remove majority of stranded costs in '24. The outlook revision reflects our increased confidence in the year, ongoing resilience of consumer consumption in our categories, relatively benign elasticities, continued brand reinvestments and completion of pricing in Europe and the health of our emerging markets. There is a lot of volatility around the world, and it is important to note that this current outlook does not reflect a material deterioration of the geopolitical environment and ForEx rounding some areas of the business. Finally, a word on share repurchases. Now that we have received the proceeds of our sales outcome, our balance sheet is the strongest it has ever been, with long tenure debt at very compelling interest rates relative to the current cost environment. We decided to post buybacks in Q3 and were in our traditional blackout periods late in the quarter and the month leading up to earnings. However, we expect to consider buybacks for the remainder of the year and into next, given the current stock price versus our view of intrinsic value and long-term potential of our company. We realize we have underspent versus our original outlook of $2 billion for the year and that provides the opportunity to take advantage of current low stock price levels. Additionally, we could pull forward from our '24 share repurchases if an appropriate opportunity presented itself. We will be flexible and opportunistic in our timing, depending on the various useful factors. We believe this is the right thing to do, given the current context. Importantly, this does not represent a change in our ability to pursue our well-defined capital allocation strategies as our priorities remain the same in terms of reinvesting in the business and in selected strategically and financially attractive bolt-on M&As as well as strong dividend growth. With that, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Thanks so much. Good afternoon. Dirk, clearly, pricing, as you went through was very strong in the quarter. But despite this volume came in better than our forecast in every region as well. And we know price sort of comes and goes. So I'd really like your thoughts more on how you feel about the sustainability of volume growth going forward, particularly in the context of sort of the state of the consumer as you see it? Dirk Van de Put : Yes. Thank you, Andrew, and hello. First of all, yes, maybe restating quickly what is driving the volume growth in the different regions to give a clarification around that. And yes, we are constructive as it relates to volume for the remainder of this year and next year and then talk a little bit about the consumer. So we have a strong volume/mix across all our regions. And overall, we're up almost 4%. If I start with North America, there we are up 4.6% in year-to-date, 3% in volume/mix. The categories are experiencing a little bit of softness there. But our biscuit business is performing significantly better and delivering some significant volume share gains, about 1.2 points in the last 3 months. We also have that from unmeasured channels, which are performing well, the club channels, online because consumers are shifting there because that gives them better pricing opportunities. Switching to Europe. There, we see a 3.3% volume/mix increase. Year-to-date, that is flat seen the disruption that we had in the beginning of the year. We see biscuits and chocolate volumes being quite resilient. And in Q3, we saw the volume/mix growth accelerating, outpacing the rest of food. The reason there is that the elasticities are quite solid. And we also take into account that we are lapping 2022 disruptions in Europe. And then emerging markets is up 3.4% in volume/mix. Year-to-date, also 3.4%, but we have certain markets like India and Mexico, where we have double-digit volume growth. It's quite remarkable because these markets have quite significant pricing, all the emerging markets. And the reason being is that the consumer confidence is quite good. The demand is resilient. We see the consumer in places like India, China, Mexico are in a four-year high, and that is clearly having an effect on demand. We also are gaining in these markets by expanding our distribution. That's always an extra benefit that we have. And we've been doing smart downsizing. One of the things we do in these markets is our LUPs or lower unit price. We try to keep that price constant that we have the entry into the category not being affected. Going forward, we expect the recovery in Europe to continue because pricing has landed and we are back on the shelf, and we are running full force in our commercial activities. Our inventory levels around the world are very healthy, including in North America, so we don't see any effect there. The elasticities remain relatively benign. But here and there, some modest upticks, but all the dynamics are included in our outlook. We think that the expansion of volume in emerging markets is going to continue. And in fact, it's a good problem to have. But in India and Mexico, the key challenge is to how to keep up with the heavy volume increase that we're seeing. And then we believe that everything we're doing for our long-term strategy is the things we are focused on and different activities that we have planned confirmation that is working for us, particularly also, for instance, the reinvestments we're doing. Maybe quickly on the consumer because that is probably the biggest factors to keep in mind as you think about volumes going forward. We find that consumer demand remains very resilient in our key markets. Consumers continue to prioritize spending on grocery and branded products. And we see the consumer confidence outlook for '24 stable for developed markets in North America and Europe, but very positive for emerging markets. So if I quickly think this through, modest improvement probably in consumer confidence in Europe and Australia. Why? Because the inflation is clearly easing there. They see the real disposable income go up. There is some shifting to smaller packs in places like France and the UK and to discounters because they're looking still for value for money. But overall, we feel pretty good about the consumer in Europe and Australia. In the US and Canada, we think the consumer confidence will be holding, but we have to monitor the trends quite closely because we see shifts to non-measured channels, as I said, such as e-commerce and club, we see buying of more multipacks. We see lower income families pull back on the amount of the frequency of their trips to the store. And we also have the delayed unwinding of the pantry loading from -- due to the phasing out of the SNAP benefits. And then emerging markets, we continue to see steady improvements with those four-year highs that I was talking about. Consumer is very optimistic about the future. Even in China, consumer confidence is improving, but slower, but we still have like 60% of our Chinese families expect their income to improve. Private label, maybe private label is losing share in the US and Canada. There is a bit of a watch out in Europe because brands have been taking pricing. But overall, I would say, we feel very good about the outlook for the rest of the year and for next year. Andrew Lazar : Great. Thank you for all the color. Really helpful. And a very quick follow-up just for Luca, I think. Just regarding what the implications are for 4Q based on your updated full year guidance? And maybe more importantly, any high-level thoughts to consider for '24 at this point? Thanks again. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Andrew. So our revised top line estimate of 14% to 15% implies a revenue growth for Q4, which is around about 7% to 10% which, considering we are lapping a 15.5% top line growth last year, makes really the two-year stack comparable to year-to-date numbers. And so I think that should give you a sense of where we're going to land the Q4. Keep in mind that we also want to keep a tight control on retailer inventory as we enter next year because, obviously, there is potentially some pricing, and we won't really to enter with a strong momentum into Q1. On EPS, the expected growth of around about 16% for the year implies a moderate increase in constant currency in Q4. Reason for that is, again, the heightened investment in A&C. And in addition, as I said in the prepared remarks, there is some ForEx volatility, particularly around certain markets like Argentina, Nigeria, Pakistan and Egypt. And it is quite difficult to predict what exchange rates will be in the course of the quarter. So quite, frankly, I have been a little bit cautious with our assumption. And as I don't want to surprise anyone. Also remember, gum is completely removed from this number. So this is not really a like-for-like. And I think you're going to like you realize the EPS and continued profit expansion in Q4. I also want to reassure you that the emerging markets are doing very, very, very well. And we don't necessarily disclose numbers, but EBIT is up more than 20% in emerging markets on a year-to-date basis in real dollar terms. So these are, again, a market that can be volatile. But in the end, they deliver a good profit for us. On '24, we are clearly in the process of finalizing our plan, but I can give you a little bit of the soundbites around '24. First of all, I think it is undeniable that the business is having good momentum, and that momentum from where we sit today will continue as we enter into -- as we go into '24, both in terms of top and bottom line. Pricing contribution will be clearly less important than this year, but we still see pricing contributing more than an average year, particularly as we need to price for cocoa, sugar and other commodities. A good portion as we went through the plans with the majority of the business units, a good portion of growth in both in developed and emerging markets will be coming through distribution expansion. And that will help preserve volume momentum into '24. And I think you know that our categories in emerging markets are underpenetrated, and we have made investment to really continue to grow. Platforms that we have acquired in recent months like Clif and Ricolino are progressing very well. And they will deliver more synergies as we go into '24. And while I don't have a number on the gum divestiture to disclose to you, the idea that we have is really to get rid of all the stranded costs associated with the divestiture of gum in developed markets. So I can't be more precise, but so far, so good in terms of '24 expected financials I would say. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Goldman, JPMorgan. Kenneth Goldman : Hey, thank you. I just wanted to get a clearer sense of the messaging around share repo. You paused in 3Q. You reduced your outlook for the year. But at the same time, you're saying, hey, if there's an opportunity, maybe you can pull forward some of your planned repo for '24, if I heard that right. So I just wanted to maybe sure I heard that right that I can reconcile these comments. And maybe it's just as simple as you pivoted a bit toward debt paydown earlier this year, you weren't 100% sure when gum would close. Now these factors are somewhat behind you, so you can forge ahead on buybacks. I just want to ensure it's a little bit of a whipsaw effect there in terms of how we're seeing or I'm seeing the commentary? I just wanted to make sure I can clarify that. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Ken. No, you're absolutely correct and right in your analysis. We continue to see share repurchases as a key driver of total shareholder return. I do analysis regularly on the buybacks that we do historically, and we present them to our Board as well. I mean it's fair to say that all the repurchases we have done since the creation of Mondelez have yielded good -- very good returns, while in excess of our cost of capital. Our ability to buy back stock at this point in time is meaningful considering what we have bought so far this year. And look, we will remain flexible and disciplined. The reality is, I also believe that our stock is a bit undervalued at this point in time. And so we will be tactical in the way we approach this. But I don't have really much to add versus what you correctly said in your question. I also want to make sure that it is clear that this doesn't imply anything in terms of changes from our capital allocation framework. I mentioned Clif and Ricolino in the prepared remarks. I'm very pleased with the numbers that I see coming to. I think those were great opportunity for us to deploy capital. Dirk mentioned that we have some capacity constraints. There is nothing better in my mind that investing in brands that are proven like Oreo, Milka, Cadbury Dairy Milk. Proven proposition, distribution gains et cetera are really making the return on those investments quite good. And finally, dividends, we are committed, and we will continue to raise dividends in the foreseeable future. So strong cash flow, I think, you might have seen $0.5 billion up versus last year. Everything is going fine in terms of capital allocation, I would say. Kenneth Goldman : And then quickly, just at the risk of, I guess, eliciting some grown maybe by dredging up last month's topic, just curious where you are in your research about GLP-1s? Even on a broad level, if you don't have specifics, is there a reason to think that your snacking categories won't be affected, just assuming there's any impact at all? Just wanted to kind of pick around for your initial thoughts there. Dirk Van de Put : Yes. Thanks, Ken. Well, first of all, I think the whole topic has been overblown. And I think it's important to put it in perspective and look at the data. At this stage, we see absolutely no short-term impact on our results. We don't see it in our business. We are, of course, monitoring and we have a special work stream to stay close to the topic. We do estimates, we do projections, we talk to pharmaceutical companies, we talk to consumers and so on. So we're staying close to the subject. But long-term, even using the most optimistic forecast, we believe the impact will be very modest to our volumes in our categories. We're talking about 0.5% to 1% volume effect 10 years down the road. That's based on what we know today and projections that are not ours, but that are being used by several different sources, and that assumes quite significant adoption rates of the drug. Even if the impact would be bigger than that, I think over a 10-year period, it will be manageable, and we will have adequate lead time to adjust and prepare for any changes that we see. Having said all that, if you think about it, obesity rates around the world are very different. And we have one of the lowest exposures since 75% of our sales come from outside of the US, 40% of our sales are in emerging markets. And so the average BMIs in all those countries are much lower than in the US So our exposure is significantly lower than some of the other food companies. On top of that, I believe that our portfolio is really well positioned. We constantly innovate and adapt our products. We do that all the time to adapt to changing consumers' tastes and behaviour's. Portion control is a big part of our strategy. So 20% of our sales are already in snacks that are less than 200 calories. We have a large part of our portfolio that is chocolate, which is not hunger satisfaction, but it's a small indulgence. And we have healthier alternatives like for the breakfast occasion, belVita, which is a replacement snack or some of our snack bars, which are meal replacement, and that fit perfectly into the diet of GLP-1 patients. So if I go through all that and if I'm honest, at this stage, this is really into our top areas that we are focused on and that we are trying to manage. We monitor it, but it's really not a big concern for us at this stage. Operator : Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane, Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : Hey, thanks, operator. Good evening guy. So I guess I had one follow-up to Ken's question and another question. In terms of the follow-up to Ken, in terms of capital allocation, Luca, you had -- you were opportunistic, right, in terms of paying down commercial paper. You paid off the term loan this year, kind of attacking some of those either variable rate or avoiding sort of swapping out of low interest to high interest . So as you're looking over the next year or two, like are there even many opportunities to where you would opportunistically pay down debt? Or again, not changing your capital allocation sort of philosophy, but just it doesn't seem -- it doesn't appear that paying down debt would necessarily be at the top of the list just given what you've done over the past year? And then I have a follow-up. Luca Zaramella : No, I think, that's absolutely correct. We are very happy with the loan tenure debt that we have. The average cost of debt is very compelling. It was a series of decisions that we took over the last few months, including the sell-down of KDP to really go and strengthen the balance sheet and making sure that we were not facing material pressure in the interest cost line. I think in hindsight that has proven to be quite a good decision. The reality is, I still see our stock as undervalued. And so when you look at the cash flow this year, and you adjust for the coffee taxes that are really one-time in nature, I mean, you start talking about $3.7 billion, $3.8 billion of cash flow generation. And I think if you take that and continuous growth of dividend, we have what it takes really to manage the business very well. And so I don't feel really compelled at this point in time to go and pay down more debt. We have some debt coming due next year. It is absolutely manageable. And when that comes due, hopefully, interest costs will be lower than today, but again, not really a major concern for me at this point. Bryan Spillane : Okay. Great. And then just two follow-ups on some of the commentary you've made about '24, and I might have missed this, but I think you had said previously mid-single-digit cost of goods inflation for '24. So just is that still something we should work with? And then as we're thinking about organic sales growth, I think, you've been in this quarter, if you take Argentina and gum, collectively, they contributed about 500 basis points to the organic sales comp. So just -- I don't know, as we're thinking about not extrapolating too much, right? Just how we should think about some of the other puts and takes on organic sales growth and understanding you gave some comments about volume and price, but just want to get your perspective on that, those two items? Luca Zaramella : Yes. Maybe look, transparently and it is noted both on the pages of the prepared remarks and in my script. Argentina, I think, in total for the company accounted for a little bit more than two points, not much more than that. If you strip out gum completely from the year-to-date numbers and for the -- both volume and revenue, I would say there is no material change to either volume or net revenue. So in terms of growth rates, I would say Argentina is clear, but it has always been in that range, I would say, a little bit higher in Q3. In terms of gum, no material impact to the top line dynamics on both volume and revenue. I think as you go into next year, or as we go into next year, the inflation that you're going to see is higher than mid-single-digit. I think it is going to be towards the higher end of 5% to 10% at this point in time. Coco lately has had a material spike. The reason being the pulp count coming out of [indiscernible] and Africa has been materially different than what people expected, I would say. So there is pressure on coco. The good news is we are covered for a good portion of the first half next year, and we are protected as well for the remainder of the year. So I'm not going to give you a lot of details here, but you would expect inflation in general to go up. And lately, I think you know, energy costs have been going up a little bit more crude oil, particularly. So I would say we are not done, I believe, in terms of inflation at this point in time. There's still could be variability exchange rates is the other one that comes into play. But it might be a little bit higher than the mid-single digits we told you, but we are going to be flexible for sure. As we go through the plans, we have a sensitivity analysis, and we make sure that we are never going to be called by surprise here. Our coverage is favorable, but we will be pricing at replacement cost into '24. Operator : Our next question comes from David Palmer, Evercore ISI. David Palmer : Thanks. Just, first, a follow-up on Andrew's 2024 question. It seems like we should be thinking at least in an year for profit, but maybe a little bit higher than normal on revenue, largely because of the pricing side. Correct me if I'm wrong on that thinking. But digging deeper, I just wanted to ask you, you mentioned some things that were giving you confidence about next year, such as the distribution gains in emerging markets. What are some of the hurdles or watchouts that you're really thinking about specifically for your business? This earlier this year, it was about getting through pricing in Europe. What are some things you're really watching out for as you go into this next year? Luca Zaramella : Thank you, David. I don't want to spoil the '24 guidance too much. I know you really want to get a sense of where '24 is going to be look at this point. We have made material investments in the business this year. We believe our categories are very sound across the world. I think we -- you saw the share numbers we have been posting. We are happy with overall business momentum. I don't want to say exactly how next year is going to play out at this point. I think your assertion on top line and bottom line is more or less correct. I said we are working through the implications of gum and the EPS impact of it and stranded costs. I'll give you a little bit more color in the next quarter. As far as distribution goes, look, particularly in emerging markets, there is a reason as to why we are telling you, China for us is okay or India is okay or Mexico is okay. And the reason is that our categories in general are underpenetrated. And the second reason I would say is there is a meaningful amount of growth, both in developed and emerging markets that is coming out of distribution gains. I think in the US, for a series of reasons you know, supply chain-related, we lost some PDPs along the way. We are reinstating those PDPs. We are going into alternate channels where our share is a little bit lower. So at this point in time, I feel good that you're going to see a good policy top line into '24. Hopefully, that helps, but I can't spoil it much more than that. David Palmer : No, that's helpful. Just a quick question on the US. There was another player out there that we're seeing some reduced merchandising activity and shelf presence because of clean store initiative and a major retailer. You guys are pretty good at getting merchandising. Is that going to affect your business in the near term in the US? Dirk Van de Put : No, no. We are in good shape as it relates to shelf availability and stock levels. The shelf availability is higher than it was last year. The stock levels are where they should be. They're not high. Our sales are higher, our units are higher. We have more displays, we have more items carried with that retailer. So we see no effect. I want to point out that we do have a DSD system that covers the stores. And that is always very helpful in driving in-store execution and finding the necessary extra space and presence. And so we're also making sure that we have the right level of staffing at store level. But no, I cannot confirm that we see the same effect. We feel very good about how things are playing out at the moment. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Lavery, Piper Sandler. Michael Lavery : Thank you and good afternoon. Just wanted to check on Ricolino. You've said that the integration is progressing well. That's a case where you have a revenue synergy opportunity just given their distribution footprint. How quickly is that ramping up? Is it -- can you give an update on just how that's progressing and if that's coming along with your expectations? I think the expectation was it would give a lift to some of your legacy brands as well. How is that coming along? Dirk Van de Put : Yes. So talking about the top line synergies, first, what -- how we're going to get those is that we are integrating the two distribution systems. And that will, for our side of the equation, triple the amount of distribution points that we will have. So pretty important top line synergies there. But the first step is to get that integration going. We're in the middle of testing. We had to carve out the distribution system out of Bimbo and for Ricolino and set up a new system, which is bigger than what we currently have in the company. So we have to open about 100 distribution centers. In Mexico, we're three quarters along the way with that, and that is going very well on time and as planned. And we have started the testing of the combined routes in several of those distribution centers. So the effect will start to take place from now going forward for the next 18 months, I would say, that we get the benefits to sort of work out for us. So far, everything is working out exactly as planned. And so we have high hopes that you will see the significant benefit from that next year. Michael Lavery : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you. Luca Zaramella : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Smith, Stifel. Matthew Smith : Hi. Thank you. Just wanted to follow up on the commentary about the channel shift in the US with club and e-commerce growing much faster than measured channels in the biscuit business. Can you talk about how that's impacting your share performance and if there's a margin difference for you between the channels? And maybe just as a follow-up, are you seeing or hearing from retailers in the measured channels that they're adjusting for the consumer behavior shift? Dirk Van de Put : Yes. So, yes, the shift is noticeable largely because those channels offer larger packs, both online and in the club channels and that's what consumers are looking for. We see our volume share going up overall due to the share that we are gaining, although those channels are not always measured, but we know that our shares are going up there. So we feel pretty good about what's going on there. The margin for us is about the same. So we don't see a significant margin effect. And as it relates to some of the consumer benefits we see, for instance, a brand like belVita is benefiting from that shift because it has a bigger presence in those channels. So overall, I would say, clearly a volume effect -- a volume and a share effect for us. No effect on the margins and no real necessary adaptation from our side. Matthew Smith : Thank you for that. I'll pass it on. Operator : Our final question comes from John Baumgartner, Mizuho Securities. John Baumgartner : Good afternoon. Thanks for fitting me in. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, John. Luca Zaramella : Hi, John. John Baumgartner : Hi, there. Luca I'd like to ask about reinvestment. Overhead expenses were up double-digits in Q3. They're also up double digits year-to-date as well, I think. Can you just update us on the progress there, where you've made the biggest improvements in capabilities for this year's spending? What capabilities you plan to build next with future investments into through 2024? And then maybe how you're thinking about generating operating leverage on that spending as we move forward? Luca Zaramella : Yes. So the numbers are somewhat impacted by the acquisitions as well. So the acquisitions are clearly incremental year-on-year and they make their way into overhead cost and particularly. So the way you have to think about our overhead cost is the following. We have been managing inflation quite effectively as a company. Inflation, though, particularly labor-related inflation, has been a little bit higher. In these numbers, there is a cost associated with our management incentive plan and long-term incentive plan. The company has done very well, and that has resulted in some incremental costs. All the rest in terms of corporate costs and other functions, we have been investing in three areas selectively. One, it is digital capabilities, and it is the biggest bump you see in corporate costs. We have been investing in sales, and we have been investing in marketing. All the other functions has managed inflation that is below of the revenue growth in their respective market. And functions like finance, particularly has been pretty much, I would say, a little bit higher than flat in terms of cost. So we have been selectively investing in three areas digital services, sales and marketing, and that will continue into next year. All their assets being kept absolutely in control. And then there is a cost associated with the acquisitions and management incentive plans. That's a simple way you have to think about it. Where do we spend in terms of investments? We will continue investing in sales capabilities, particularly in emerging markets. We will continue to invest in marketing, both people and A&C, as we call it. And in terms of digital, there is going to be an acceleration. We are looking into as a major investment that is coming our way and that is both capital and running costs, but it's too early to talk about that. So hopefully, that provides you with some color around our total overhead costs. John Baumgartner : Yes. That's great. And then, Dirk, just coming back to the adjacent categories, the packaged croissant the snack bars, I think you referred to it as being in a test and learn phase. And I'm curious, there's a lot going on right now with innovation, synergies and the assets. What sort of stands out to you thus far in terms of surprises or having a greater appreciation for these assets? What are you -- I guess, what are you learning from test and learn at this point? Dirk Van de Put : Yes, I wouldn't say it's all test and learn. So it's a mixture of just reinforcing the businesses that we have, more launches from our own range, doing some geographical expansion, doing some distribution expansion. So it's a lot more than test and learn. If I start with snack bars, I think we are discovering the power of snack bars. That's why we highlighted it in the prepared remarks. We're doing particularly well with Clif and also with a brand like Grenade in the UK and in Europe, which is really growing very fast. So first conclusion would be snack bars are going to be a real strength for us. There's a big opportunity in the rest of the world. If you look at the development of the snack bar market in the US, it's far ahead of the rest of the world. So we see a huge opportunity there in the years to come. And particularly in the Anglo-Saxon countries, we think that's going to happen first. As it relates to cakes and pastries, there is this segment, which is in-store bakery. Give & Go, that's not a test and learn anymore. That's now a $900 million business, but that has been very incremental to us. We've seen some very significant growth. It's a segment that is growing very fast, and we're taking share. So our expectation is that going forward, Give & Go will continue to see big growth because clients like Target or Walmart are moving from made in-stores towards freeze and thaw, which is what Give & Go is offering there. So second conclusion, the in-store bakery segment is going to be very interesting for us going forward. And then the third one that is important for us is the expansion of our current brands into the cakes and pastries market. So we've launched Cakesters in the US or we have launched Airy Cake in China under Oreo, both very big successes. Things that are clearly an indication that our brands have the potential to play in this cakes and pastries space, and it's a very nice addition and really extends the footprint and the consumers that we have. And then lastly, there is Chipita, which is the packaged croissant. We're doing test and learns in three markets at the moment around the world. Not all the results are in, but we've seen, for instance, in a country like Brazil that there is a real interest. The segment is really not that established, but our test and learn was very positive, and we are now gearing up for a launch in the country. I'm expecting in the other countries that we are doing some tests that we will get similar results because if you think about it, Give & Go was already very successful in places like Mexico or in the Middle East. So it's a real sort of emerging market proposition, meal replacement at a very affordable price, reasonable quantity of product. So I think there's going to be a real opportunity to make that a worldwide business for us. So those would be the four big ones at the moment from the adjacencies. So far, so very good, I would say. We'll keep on informing you. But everything is going in line or in fact well above plan in this area. Dirk Van de Put : I think with that we -- Okay. Thank you. And with that, we've come to the end of our call. We feel good about the quarter. We feel good about the next quarter and about next year. Thank you for your interest and see you next quarter. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, everyone. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Mondelez International Fourth Quarter 2023 and Year-End Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Mondelez management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondelez. Please go ahead, sir. Shep Dunlap : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van De Put, our Chairman and CEO; and Luca Zaramella, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K, Q and 8-K filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. As we discuss our results today, unless noted as reported, we'll be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures, which adjust for certain items included in our GAAP results. In addition, we provide our year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. You can find the comparable GAAP measures and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation. Today, Dirk will provide a business and strategy update followed by a review of our financial results and outlook by Luca. We will close with Q&A. I'll now turn the call over to Dirk. Dirk Van De Put : Thanks, Shep, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. I will start on slide four. I'm pleased to share that we delivered our best year ever in 2023, with robust top-line growth, continued share improvements, record profit dollar growth and strong total shareholder return. Our double-digit top-line performance was driven by strong pricing execution and positive volume mix growth. We also delivered continued share improvements as consumers across the globe remain very engaged with our iconic snacking brands. We set another record for gross profit dollar growth achieving $2.2 billion through ongoing cost discipline and sound pricing to offset cost inflation, as well as volume leverage. We continued our track record of strong free cash flow, generating $3.6 billion. To accelerate our strategy of global snacking leadership, we continue to invest significantly in our brands and capabilities, driving multi-year growth on both the top and bottom lines. I'm especially proud of our record financial results, as well as returning nearly $4 billion in capital to shareholders. These results deepen our confidence that the strength of our brands, our proven strategy, our continued and increasing investments, and especially our great people, position us well to achieve our long-term financial targets in 2024 and beyond. Turning to slide five, you can see that 2023 was a strong year on both the top and bottom lines with substantial reinvestment to drive continued growth in the year ahead. Organic net revenue grew 14.7% or $4.6 billion versus prior year. Our continuing solid performance in volume mix demonstrates that consumers continue to prioritize our brands and categories. We also delivered record adjusted gross profit dollar growth of $2.2 billion, up 18.8%, significantly lapping the last several years. We are proud of our team's continued focus and commitment, which enables us to continue investing in the business to drive further sustained growth. Accordingly, we increased A&C investments by more than 21%, helping to drive consumer and customer loyalty to both our iconic global brands and our local jewels, which represent the taste of the nation in their markets. These results translated into strong OI growth of nearly $1 billion, up more than 19% versus prior years. Adjusted EPS grew 19% on top of strong growth in the past several years. All told, we remain confident that our virtuous cycle of strong gross profit dollar growth, fueling local first commercial execution, and increasing investments in our strong brands, capabilities and talent will enable us to continue delivering attractive, sustainable growth. I'm especially proud to share that we continue to outperform our peers in total shareholder return. As you can see on slide six, our five-year TSR is nearly double the average of our peer group. Our one-year return is particularly impressive with Mondelez delivering double-digit growth, while our peer average return has fallen into negative territory. We view these results as evidence that we have the right strategy, the right brands, and the right people to continue delivering long-term value for our stakeholders. Switching to slide seven. Our performance in 2023 gives us confidence that we have not only the right growth strategy, but also the right execution to deliver it. Here are just a few highlights of our strategy in action. Our biggest global brands, Oreo, Milka, and Cadbury achieved more than $10 billion in global net revenues. We continue accelerating our focus on our core categories for chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks, because these categories offer attractive growth and profitability. We remain on track to deliver 90% of our revenue through these core categories. We also continue to make strong progress in executing our growth strategy. Our U.S. supply chain has stabilized and we have added more than 600,000 stores to our emerging market distribution channels. Additionally, we continue to advance our portfolio reshaping strategy. In 2023, we integrated Clif Bar and Ricolino, now we are harnessing the power of these recent acquisitions to strengthen our presence in the global snack bar and the Mexican chocolate and candy segments. We also completed the sale of our developed market gum business for $1.4 billion, providing another important source of reinvestment to further advance our brands, talents and capabilities. On slide eight, along with our financial performance, I'm pleased to share that we made significant progress toward our sustainability goals and targets in 2023. First, we continue to advance our leadership in more sustainably sourced critical ingredients. About 80% of the cocoa volume used in our chocolate brands is sourced through Cocoa Life, our signature cocoa sourcing program. There works just to lift up the people and restore landscapes where cocoa grows. We also made continued progress in helping to combat climate change. We achieved an important milestone in 2023 by submitting our roadmap to achieve net zero by 2050 through the Science Based Targets Initiative. Additionally, we continued advancing our light and right packaging strategy. More than 97% of our packaging now is designed to be recycled. We also continue investing in ways to empower consumers to make more mindful snacking choices that fit into their healthy active lifestyles. More than 55% of our snacks revenue comes from Mindful Portion Snacks, that is, snacks that are packaged in individually wrapped Mindful Portion serving sizes or with clear Mindful Portion recommendations unpack. These are just a few highlights of our continuing progress towards building a more sustainable snacking company. We continue to believe that helping to drive positive change at scale is an integral part of value creation, with positive returns for our stakeholders. We encourage you to watch our annual Snacking Made Right report, which will be published in April to view our full-year sustainability data. Turning to slide nine. You can see that like many companies, we continued to navigate through a dynamic operating environment. We are closely tracking and planning around a number of near-term themes, including continuing inflation, shifting consumer habits, geopolitical challenges, rising cocoa prices, just to name a few. We are well-positioned to address these challenges and we remain confident that we can deliver an on-algorithm year. Our confidence is rooted in our conviction that we have the right strategy, the right execution, and the right people, as well as very strong widely loved brands. We continue to see momentum in the majority of our key emerging markets. Our categories remained resilient and our solid volume mix performance demonstrates that consumers continue to prioritize our iconic snacking brands. To continue accelerating this momentum, we are continuing to increase our investment significantly in our brands and capabilities. We are pleased that our U.S. supply chain has substantially improved and we continue to focus on expanding distribution opportunities in both developed and emerging markets. We are also making solid progress in our European pricing negotiations. We expect to deliver robust EPS growth in both constant and real dollars in 2024. And overall, we remain confident that we have the right strategy to effectively navigate today's volatile environment while continuing to focus on long-term sustainable growth. In conclusion, I'm pleased to reiterate that 2023 was another record year. Our focus and portfolio reshaping strategy is working and we are well-positioned to continue driving attractive growth in 2024 and beyond. By continuing to double down on our attractive core categories of chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks, investing in our widely loved brands, focusing on operational execution and cost discipline and empowering our great people, I am confident that we can deliver strong performance for years to come. With that. I'll turn it over to Luca to share additional insights on our financials. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Dirk, and good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into our financial results and the 2024 outlook, it is important to provide some context related to the developed market gum divestiture and its impact on our results. On slide 11, you can see that impact of the divestiture on revenue was roundabout $500 million, while our growth, 0.3 percentage points negative. EPS was impacted by minus $0.11. I'll give you more color as this relates to the outlook later in the call, and how we plan to fully offset impact on income. Moving to slide 12. In 2023, we delivered exceptional results, starting with double-digit revenue growth, with both volume and value contributing. As we keep saying, gross profit dollars is the most important P&L variable as it allows reinvestment protect on our virtual cycle. Last year, GP dollars grew by $2.2 billion, allowing substantial reinvestments, strong earnings and robust cash flow generation. The strengths of these results can be seen across all regions and categories. Revenue growth was plus 14.7% in the year with 1.3 points of growth coming from volume mix. For the quarter, growth was about 10%, with a slight decline in volume mix. Emerging markets grew by 20.4% for the year and 14.9% for the quarter with strength coming from a substantial number of key countries, including Brazil, China, India, Mexico, and the Western Andean. Developed markets grew plus 11.1% for the year and plus 6.6% for the quarter, including robust growth from both U.S. and Europe. Moving to portfolio performance on slide 13. Our chocolate and biscuit businesses, both delivered double-digit growth for the year. Also gum and candy continued to perform well with superior growth in emerging markets. Biscuits grew plus 11.9% for the year and plus 5.5% for the quarter. A large number of brands delivered strong growth for 2023, including Oreo, Ritz, Chips Ahoy!, [Indiscernible] Tate's Bake, Give & Go, 7Days, TUC, and Club Social. Chocolate grew plus 14.5% for the year and plus 11.2% for the quarter with significant growth across both developed and emerging markets. Volume mix was up by 2.5% for the year and 2.4% for the quarter. Global brands like Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka, and Toblerone all delivered extraordinary growth while we also delivered strong growth with many of our local jewels including Lacta, Ricolino and Kinh Do. Gum and candy grew more than 28% for the year and 20% for the quarter. Key markets including Brazil, Mexico, China and the Western Andean area, all performed well. Let's review market-share performance on Slide 14. We held or gained share in 65% of our revenue base with strong results in both chocolate and biscuits. Given the amount of pricing we took in the last couple of years, we see this as a strong accomplishment and our brand investments, both from a quantity and quality standpoint, clearly played the role. Turning to region performance on slide 15. Europe grew plus 14.5% for the year and plus 11.6% for the quarter. Strong execution led to positive volumes mix for the year, despite significant customer disruption in Q2. Profit in '23 was up plus 12.8% for the year and plus 1.6% for the quarter. Underlying profit in Europe continues to improve, but Q4 was negatively impacted by ForEx fluctuations on some cash deposit held in dollars, that function as a protection against currency volatility. Excluding these headwinds, EBIT in Q4 was up nicely, despite a significant increase in A&C. North America grew plus 9.5% for the full-year, while Q4 grew plus 1.9% against an exceptionally strong compare of almost 20% in 2022. Full year growth was driven by higher pricing, broad-based strength across brands and channels and solid volume mix. In Q4, volumes declined as a result of softening US biscuit category, tight inventory management in advance of Q1 pricing and declines in Give & Go and Clif. Give & Go was impacted by our decision to release some of the holidays gingerbread kit given low profit. We continue to be very happy with Give & Go overall. Clif results were driven by lower bar consumption and inventory depletion connected to retailers building inventory in Q3 to minimize potential disruption ahead of a system transition in early October. As a result, we made adjustments to inventory driving a year-over-year shipment decline. We feel comfortable with current inventory levels along with our programming and investments to drive '24 growth. Overall we are confident regarding our prospects in '24 for North America, given our strong activation plans, TDPs expansion, growth channels and substantial investments in A&C. We are going to give you a better sense of these opportunities at CAGNY. North America OI increased plus 22.7% for the year due to strong pricing and solid volume. For the quarter, OI increased by 9.5%. AMEA grew 11.7% for the year and 7.9% for the quarter. India grew strong double digits for the year and quarter, driven by both chocolate and biscuits. China grew high single digits for the year and quarter as well. Southeast Asia grew mid-single-digits for the year and Australia delivered strong results for both the year and the quarter. As it relates to volume mix performance in the region for Q4, there has been some pressure on Western consumer brands in the Middle East since the war began and we have not been immune from that, with an impact of sales in the Middle East and part of Southeast Asia. We are supporting colleagues who have been impacted in different ways around the world as well as working with NGOs partners to aid in humanitarian efforts in the regions. While volatile and difficult to predict on a go forward basis, we are tracking the situation and working with stakeholders and planning for these dynamics in our 2024 outlook. AMEA increased OI by 14.5% for the year and 18.5% for the quarter, continuing a strong track record of annual top and bottom line growth. Latin America grew 34.8% for the year and 28.6% for the quarter, with strong volume mix growth and strong price execution. Ex-Argentina, growth for LA was plus 18.1% for the year and 9.2% for the quarter, justifying the good work done by our teams beyond price management in Argentina, Latin America delivered another strong year of profitability. OI grew plus 48.5% for the year and more than 49% for the quarter. Strong volume mix pricing and continuation of gum and candy momentum drove these results. Turning to page 16. For the year, we delivered strong double digit OI dollar growth, driven by a record high increase in gross profit of nearly $2.2 billion. This growth has enabled strong levels of reinvestment behind brands and capabilities for 2024 and beyond. In Q4, we also saw strong double digit OI and gross profit dollar growth of more than $500 million, driven by top line strength and ongoing cost discipline. Other was impacted by the Forex dynamics and fund protection in US dollar that I discussed about Europe. Next to EPS on slide 17. Full-year EPS grew plus 19% in constant currency. The vast majority of this growth was driven by operating gains and despite currency headwind, we grew adjusted EPS at reported Forex by 14.3%. Adjusted EPS would be $3.30 per share, including $0.11 of contribution from DM Gum. I'll talk more about our plans for '24, but we will aim at removing as much standard cost as possible. Turning to slide 18. We delivered $3.6 billion of free cash flow for the full year, including the impact of more than $380 million related to cash taxes from the liquidation of our KDP stake. Our balance sheet remains quite strong as full year leverage ended at 2.6 times. Let me take a moment to discuss our outlook and some of our key planning assumptions on Slide 20. For the current year, we expect to deliver on our long term algorithm for revenue, earnings and cash flow. We expect to be at the upper end of our 3% to 5% algo range for organic net revenue growth as pricing in certain markets with significant chocolate portfolios such as Europe is expected to be higher than historical levels. We expect free cash flow of $3.5 billion-plus. In terms of the assumptions, for inflation, we expect a high single digit increase for '24. This inflation is driven by significant increases in both cocoa and sugar, as well as another update in labor costs. As Europe faces more inflation than any other market, we expect customer disruption during Q1 and potentially into Q2, associated with our annual price negotiation process. This process is happening earlier in some cases than last year, so intact might be more pronounced in Q1 for top and margin lines. We also remain committed to substantial brand support in this region and all the others, similar to our stance over the last past several years. In terms of interest expenses, we expect approximately $325 million. We are expecting $0.03 of EPS of headwinds related to forex impact for the year. In terms of taxes, we expect an ETR in the mid-20s. Share repurchase expectations are around $2 billion. Turning to our EPS outlook on page 21. With respect to adjusted EPS, we expect high single digit growth of our reported base '23 of $3.30 per share, which includes the $0.11 of contribution from our divested developed gum business. We expect to eliminate nearly all of these $0.11 impact by removing stranded costs. In fact, we made good progress by already realizing this sense of stranded cost savings in late 2023. With that, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Lazar, Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Hey, everybody. Dirk, I was hoping we could get a bit of a state of the union on how you see the performance in key markets at this stage, as we saw a bit more volume weakness in North America in the fourth quarter. And conversely, it still seems like there's strength in many of the other key markets. Trying to get a sense of how you see this playing out in '24 and whether similar cadence across your markets might be the same or where it might be a bit different. And then I've just got a follow-up. Dirk Van De Put : Okay, thank you, Andrew. Yes, I mean, we see there's a very strong full year performance. We feel that there is portfolio strength, which is broad-based across our regions, across the categories, across the brands. The volume mix growth is solid for the year. We expect that to continue into next year. Our price execution has been very good this year across the business. Share performance is good. North America, we recovered. AMEA, we've been gaining share. Europe, we had some disruption effect during the year, but we started to recuperate strongly at the end of the year. The strength in emerging markets continues broadly and can comment a little bit on where there are some short term issues. And then we've very got -- got some very strong gross profit growth and $2.2 billion for the year, which has allowed us to reinvest quite significantly in the business. And so the acquisitions are doing well. EPS growth adjusted 19%, real 14%, strong cash flow. So we feel good as we enter 2024. We have some more pricing coming in, but in North America, that's already agreed. In Europe, we're in line with where we were last year and the majority is already agreed. We are planning to continue with strong investments in our brands, with strong activations. The acquisitions, we expect to continue to play a big role for us. And so overall -- and maybe another point to mention is that we have this distribution runway of adding distribution for our brands around the world. So we feel it was a very strong '23 and we feel good entering '24. Now, that doesn't mean that there are no particular issues that are on our mind. So the first one would certainly be the cocoa prices and our need to price as needed. We are well covered for the year, but we need to, mainly in Europe, get those prices agreed. Consumer, while the consumer is feeling better and more positive short term, we see that elasticity is still at or below historical norms, but there is some uptick in consumer elasticity in some spots around the world. It is to be expected that we will have customer disruption in the beginning of the year in Europe. The annual negotiations are in progress. Like I said, we are in line where we were last year and majority is agreed, but we still have some to go. And then maybe a few words on some of the effects on the volume in Q4, which we don't think will continue in Q1 in certain instances. So there is some tensions in the Middle East, and that has some effect on Western brands and we have some of those Western brands. We expect that to continue in Q1 and Q2, but gradually over the year, that will fade away. And that is the main reason why our AMEA is not as strong in volume mix as you would expect. And then North America. Luca said it in the comments, in particular in the US, because of very one-off -- specific one-off reasons, stopping part of the range of Give & Go, the systems change in Clif, we expect to return to good volume mix growth in North America in the beginning of next year. All these items that I'm talking about are included in our full year outlook. And so we believe at this stage, particularly since we have to see how the negotiations go in Europe, that we should guide towards our own algo result for '24, probably more towards the higher side, but we are going to continue with all the things I said and we'll see how the negotiations go in Europe. That's probably the main question mark that we have at this stage. Andrew Lazar : Okay. Great, thank you. And a quick follow-up for Luca and some of this you covered a little bit, Dirk, but I think there was a street expectation for organic sales growth for '24 to maybe be a little bit above the 3% to 5% long term algorithm, just given the pricing that you're taking. So maybe, Luca, you could walk us briefly through some of the just key puts and takes to keep in mind as we think about the sales growth guidance for the year and maybe the phasing aspect of it. Thanks so much. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Andrew. I would start by saying that guidance for '24 in our mind, is solid, particularly as we look at what drove '23 and the continuation of that momentum into '24. And so we can, I believe, count on resiliencies of our categories. We're happy, as I said, in the prepared remarks on our share performance. I think you will see momentum in our share, particularly in the first half, and that is related to the unprecedented A&C investment we put forward. There are still material distribution opportunities that will help us model through some of the challenges that we discussed in the prepared remarks. And finally, the acquisitions, I think will continue to be accretive for us both in terms of top line and bottom line. Decomposing the revenue guidance, pricing is clearly a key component of this plan. Its contribution will be a little bit less than we have seen in '23, but it is higher than an average year. And particularly as we price away cocoa, chocolate will contribute to most of the pricing in '24. Pricing, as we mentioned, presents a couple of challenges. One is potential customer disruption in Europe. We have planned for it. Part of it is also in the base of '23. But while I feel positive and Dirk said more than half of the price is secured at this point, we cannot really say what is going to happen and particularly as we look into Europe, clearly we don't control customer disruption. Having said that, I think it is important to realize that our brands are strong and that they drive significant traffic for retailers. So couple that with the fact that prices is common to market and many competitors will have to price, I think we feel quite positive at this point in time, quite frankly. The second one is elasticity, for which I feel better because competitors, as I said, will have to price too, but also because our brands are unique and we have been investing quite a bit. We expect for the year volume to be mildly positive with a good contribution actually when we excluding the customer disruption. So at this point in time, given we don't control the level to which customer disruption will affect the plan, we wanted to be a little bit on the cautious side. And look, reality is if we push this through and we are successful, most likely there will be revenue upside. And so as I said, we feel good. Importantly, I want to say North America, we have very good plans as we go into 2024. And I think the lineup of all these plans plus the continuation of the momentum in the acquired platforms is good. I want to say Latin America in our case continues to be good. AMEA, despite some of the challenges, has a lot of momentum in India and China that will continue. And finally, I think if you look at Europe, excluding customer disruption, the underlying business and the categories are doing well. So I believe the year will play out well for us, depending obviously on the extent of customer disruption. Andrew Lazar : Thanks so much. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Andrew. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Goldman, J.P. Morgan. Ken Goldman : Hi, good afternoon. Dirk Van De Put : Hi, Ken. Luca Zaramella : Hi, Ken. Ken Goldman : Hi. I just wanted to clarify a little bit about the EPS guidance. So it's on algo of a $3.30 base, but it's actually above algo, if we think about it on a like-for-like basis versus the $3.19, right? If you exclude gum from both 2023 and 2024. And please correct me if that's not accurate. I'm just curious, what necessarily -- what gives you the confidence it'll be a little bit above algo just on that like-for-like basis and maybe how much of that underlying is sort of the elimination of some stranded costs as you think about it, that might just give a little bit more of a boost to the year than we might typically have. Luca Zaramella : Yes, thank you for the question, Ken. We wanted to make sure it was clear that we are trying to eliminate all the stranded costs and so we really wanted to guide high single digit of the higher base. The confidence comes from the fact that, as I said, we are going to have, excluding the customer disruption, good volume momentum into the business and that provides leverage. We will continue pricing in a very disciplined manner and that will offset the material inflation that we see. Clearly, we will continue with cost, discipline and productivity. And the fact that we will eliminate 70%, 80% of the stranded cost into '24 allows us to guide to a high single digit of a higher base. In all this algo, we are not going to have, I have to say, 20% A&C increase another year, but it will be most likely high single digit or double digits. So we will continue investing across all the regions, across all the brands. And so we feel good about that. Remember finally that through the integration of Ricolino, there will be synergies coming to fruition. We are literally going live with SAP in few days and hopefully that will unlock both revenue and cost synergies for 2024. Ken Goldman : Thank you. And then quick follow up. You mentioned disruption a little bit more in 1Q this year, with the understanding it's quite early, is there any way we can get a little bit more of a quantitative sense just to how to think about some of the impact potentially on the top and bottom line in the quarter? I realize, like I said, it's impossible to kind of completely forecast it at the time, but just any kind of magnitude at this point would be helpful as we think about our models, perhaps. Luca Zaramella : Look, I think as you look at the Q1 revenue pacing, we are going to have a revenue maybe number that is a little bit below the full year algo. I think you're going to be hopefully happy with the numbers you see across three regions out of the four. Europe is going to be more impacted in relative terms versus the impact that we have already in the base in '23 in Q2, and most likely volume mix, excluding the customer disruption is going to be a nice number and positive. I believe total volume mix might be tilted to slightly negative because of the disruption, but I can't go any further than that. We are in the middle of negotiations and conversations with retailers, and we have planned, we have a sense of what might happen, but time will tell exactly how we will land pricing in Europe. Ken Goldman : Understood. Thank you. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Ken. Operator : Our next question comes from Bryan Spillane, Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : Hey, thanks, operator. Good afternoon, Dirk, Luca. Dirk Van De Put : Hey, Bryan. Bryan Spillane : It looks just... Luca Zaramella : Hi, Bryan. Bryan Spillane : Hey, just a -- I have a couple of questions, actually, and one is just getting back to the guidance, and I just want to tie in. It's $2 billion a share repurchase this year, but you also repurchased quite a bit of shares in the fourth quarter. So if we think about the impact that share repurchases or a lower share count would have on fiscal '24, it should be more than the roughly 2% that a %2 billion repo would suggest. Right? Just simply because the timing of your '23 share repurchases were so late, it should drive the share count down a little bit more than we would normally see. I just want to make sure I'm thinking about that correctly. Luca Zaramella : I think you're thinking about that correctly. Yes. Bryan Spillane : Okay, all right, Because that's going to square to just how much we need to burden operating profit growth, and I think it's not going to be quite as high as I think, as it would have sort of looked. Okay, thanks for that. And then the second question, just. Luca, if you could talk a little bit about Argentina? You know it's been topical over this earnings season for companies operating there. We've seen a range of outcomes, I guess, or actions companies have taken. So if you just kind of walk us through Argentina, does the devaluation at all have any effect on local operations? What's incorporated into the guidance, and also, maybe if you can just touch on, is that what's driving the FX guidance to be so moderate? Because we fielded that question a bunch over the last few minutes. Thanks. Luca Zaramella : So, Argentina for us, is round about a $600 million business. We are very happy the way the business has been managed over the years. We have a clear playbook. What matters in Argentina for us is not necessarily top line growth. It's not share. It is about protecting the cash that we have there. And Argentina has been consistently generating cash for us, and we have been able also to take some cash out of the country. Some of the companies have talked about exposure on net monetary position. Our net monetary position is in control. It will go down over the course of '24 as we have a clear playbook and by the way, we incent Argentina, not like all the other business units, but we incent Argentina on net monetary position and free cash flow generation. There was a little bit of a spike in net monetary exposure in Q4, and that was, as the old government put in place some price control mechanism. But as those have been released, the net monetary position in Q4 is going to be very manageable and I don't expect any major impact due to that. It's also fair to say that we have full control of the operation. We are free to price at this point in time, and the team is fully committed to protecting as much as they can the size and the scale of Argentina. So I [Technical Difficulty] any issues or whatsoever in terms of impairment. Clearly, there has been material devaluation. The parallel market runs at rates that are even higher than the official one reported, that are obviously already much higher than last year. And so we will have to cap most likely growth for Argentina going forward into 2024. Having said that, it becomes a moot point as we guide you to organic net revenue growth and forex impact. And so the two offset each other. And if you take the guidance we gave in terms of organic net revenue growth and the impact on revenue, which is around about half a point of growth, that should do the trick in terms of you forecasting Mondelez in total. Bryan Spillane : Thanks, Luca. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Bryan. Operator : Our next question comes from David Palmer with Evercore. David Palmer : Thanks. A couple of questions. On Europe and pricing, so often we talk about the retailer, customer, and the dynamic of getting through pricing there. I wonder, as are you taking pricing this year? Are you -- is your pricing strategy to offset the dollar impact that you're going to see from cocoa? Or -- it would seem like that would be a pretty reasonable expectation for the players there, given what's happening with cocoa. But maybe there's some timing issues for 2024 there to think about. And then how -- from what you've seen about -- from the consumer there, is the pricing -- price elasticity, they are much different than what you would see from what you see in your biscuits business in the U.S., for example? Dirk Van De Put : Yes. Yes, your first assumption is correct in the sense that we are trying to offset the dollar impact of the inflation that we're seeing on our input costs, and we're not pricing for percentage margin, but offsetting that dollar impact, which yes, we believe is a reasonable position. I think this year, seeing the situation in Europe and the fact that the retailers are seeing probably some deflation in other areas of their business, it is a little bit of an explanation to explain that not only cocoa, but also sugar or hazelnut are showing significant inflation, which is not the expectation. I think by now they understand that it has to happen in chocolate, so we have high hopes that we will be able to land that in a good way. As it relates to elasticity, I would say the elasticity in Europe has been very reasonable. We might maybe expect a little bit of an uptick as prices keep on going up for a third year in a row, particularly in chocolate. But there is very little or low down-trending within the category, because everybody will have to price. So it's a joint movement of all the brands. So we don't expect that there will be huge differences between different brands and no shifting of consumers. What we've seen in the past year is a strong price increase of 12% to 15% in Europe in chocolate, with a very limited 0% to 0.5% effect on volume. And so that shows that elasticity is very low. We think that is driven because of strong brand loyalty. The fact that chocolate has a very distinct taste profile and consumers tend to stick with their chocolate brand because they like taste and people recognize the taste of their brand. So private label is very small and people do not tend to switch brands very easy. We call it the taste of the nation. Every country has their favorite chocolate. And then on top of that, we will do significant investments, very strong activations. We've been driving seasonals very hard. The next year, we will celebrate 200 years of Cadbury, which will be a major activation in the U.K. So all that combined make us believe, and we have proved in the past, that the elasticity will be limited to our opinion in chocolates in Europe. David Palmer : And a quick follow-up. Distribution growth seems to be a key driver, a growth driver for the company. I don't think I've ever heard you say how much of your organic sales growth will come from distribution expansion. But if you had to guess how many percentage points of that organic sales targets would come from that, what would you say? Dirk Van De Put : Well, roughly, you can assume, for the markets where we can drive significant numerical distribution, I'm talking about China and India, but we are now also starting to drive very hard in places like Brazil. We -- probably in those markets, you can expect that about 50% of our organic growth is driven through distribution expansion. On a global basis, we're probably talking about 2% of our extra growth coming from this. The runway of this is still quite big, to give you a few numbers. So, since 2019, we've added 1.7 million stores in China, India and Brazil. But, for instance, our biscuits are now in about 3 million of the potential 6 million stores in China, or our gum business is only in 2 million of the 6 million potential stores. In India, we've added 180,000 stores in '23. We deployed 100,000 new VISI coolers, but there is over 900 -- sorry, 9 million retail outlets. We cover directly 2 million and we have about 3 million that are indirect coverage. So we're in 5 million of the 9 million stores in India. And I can go on, on different countries. So I gave you the percentages, what it means for us. And the other message here is that the runway, the years that we can keep on doing this are quite significant going forward. David Palmer : Thank you very much. That's great. Dirk Van De Put : Thank you. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, David. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Robert Moskow : Hi. Thanks. I actually had a follow-up on the distribution question. Are you taking extra steps to monitor distribution levels at distributors or even the retailers in light of volatility of consumption? There's been multinationals who have fallen into inventory de-loading situations in LaTAM. You're expanding distribution so well. I'm just wondering if you're also taking extra steps to monitor it at the same time. Dirk Van De Put : Yes, yes, we are aware that the distribution expansion needs to be very well monitored. So what we're putting in place is a direct connection because we use mainly distributors to make this happen, is a direct connection to their system. So we can read what they sell per store and what the sell-in is, how much the replenishment is. So we monitor that very carefully. We go slow in some of the cities where we're doing the expansion so that we make sure that we can see that setting up the whole distribution system is profitable and that it can be maintained. So we've had no surprises so far. I've done this many times in my career and I've had surprises, but so far things have gone quite smoothly. I think our teams around the world know what to do. They're on top of it. We usually accompany these distribution expansions with very heavy activation in the cities that we are doing this. So we feel pretty good that we have a very controlled way of doing it. And like I said, so far we've had no surprises whatsoever with this. Robert Moskow : And a follow-up on that. In some of these markets, you've introduced more digitized tools to enable small retailers or distributors to order or reorder and also monitor their performance on promotions, I think. Has that improved your ability to keep track of distribution and monitor sales because the tools are better than they were ten years ago to monitor all this? Dirk Van De Put : Yes, we are still in a relatively experimental phase with that. We are, for instance, mainly experimenting with this in Latin America, largely in channels that we don't have immediate big coverage. So as an example, I would say bars in Brazil would be typically something that we don't cover directly or indirectly at the moment. But we have started to have a presence and we are monitoring how that is going. I would say those tools help you -- help the retailer order directly and get our products in there. It helps us to understand how much the store sells. And yes, we can monitor promotions. As a tool to monitor how our distribution is evolving, it's probably complementary to the other system I was talking about, but we prefer at this stage to monitor that through our distributors, because the way it works is they will order through this new app and then we, through our normal distribution system, will deliver, or we will use a third party to do it. So that's usually the source of the monitoring of distribution, not necessarily the new app for us. Robert Moskow : I got it, thank you. Dirk Van De Put : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Steve Powers : Yes, thanks for the question. Luca, I think based on the EPS guidance combined with the $3.5 billion-plus free cash flow guidance. At -- towards the $3.5 billion kind of ignoring the plus, if I focus on the $3.5 billion, I think it implies a 75% or lower free cash flow conversion. I just wanted to kind of throw that past you and see if that's the message you intended to convey. If so, what might be some of the drags on that free cash flow conversion, or if there's a -- it is a higher level of free cash flow conversion we should anchor to as a target? Maybe you could talk about that. Luca Zaramella : Thank you for the question, Steve. As we think about the free cash flow and net income conversion into free cash flow, important to realize that the dividend payout of the joint ventures that we have is not 100%. And so that is a little bit of a factor as you consider the conversion. The other one, I would tell you is we're going to have a slight uptick in CapEx, particularly as we need to invest in places like India. I mean, you look at the volume over the last five years in India, it has been stellar, and we are very happy, but we are at a point where we need to put down a little bit more capacity. Same goes for Latin America and Oreo, and obviously, we integrate platforms like Ricolino, et cetera. The other one that will come into play in terms of capital expenses for '24 is SAP HANA. And so I think that's another element you have to consider. I think, look, the number I would like you to focus on is what we deliver in '23, which, net of the taxes we paid for coffee, is around about $4 billion. And so there might be some one-time payment coming our way. And so we need to make sure that we have enough headroom. But I want to reassure you that in terms of free cash flow, we are very happy. We have best in class, I believe, cash conversion cycle. We continue to be very disciplined in terms of lowering overdue across the board, and inventories are coming down. And so we feel good about the cash flow generation of the company. Steve Powers : Very good. Very good. Thank you for that. And it sounds like you're going to talk a little bit more about this at CAGNY. But to the extent you can talk about it now, just the prospects for volume recovery and organic growth acceleration in North America. I guess, how quickly do you think that is likely to manifest in '24? Is that going to be a slower build, or do you think we should expect some results sooner as you leverage some of the commercial investments, it sounds like you made in the fourth quarter. Dirk Van De Put : Yes, I think you said it right at the end there. In the fourth quarter, if you think about it, on one hand, we had a good year, and we were coming with a price increase, which, by the way, has been agreed in the U.S. in the beginning of the year, so no need to push in volumes from our side. Then we had the Clif system integration changeover, and so we needed to bring our inventory down and manage it very tightly. And then we talked about the Give & Go holiday kits that we stopped selling because the margins were not interesting for us. So if I exclude those and look at the rest of the business, the volume mix performance in Q4 was, in fact, quite good. So we're expecting a good volume mix performance right away in Q1 of next year. It is really a one-off situation in Q4. So we don't really necessarily feel like there is a slowdown in North America. It's not going to be massive volume growth, but it's going to be positive volume growth in the beginning of the year. So that's where we are. It's not going to be a slow build-up. We will continue where we are without the exceptionals that we had in Q4. Steve Powers : Okay. Very good. Thanks, Dirk. I'll pass it on. Dirk Van De Put : Thanks. Luca Zaramella : Thank you. Operator : Our last question comes from Alexia Howard, Bernstein. Alexia Howard : Good evening, everyone. Dirk Van De Put : Hi, Alexia. Luca Zaramella : Hi. Alexia Howard : Hi. So, two questions. First of all, on innovation. I'm just wondering if you can give us a quick status update on whether the pace of innovation is likely to pick up going forward. It feels like with the pandemic and the supply chain disruption, it's been very hard to do innovation over the last several years. Do you anticipate a pickup going forward? And then I have a follow-up. Dirk Van De Put : Yes, we are going through a bit of a change in the way we look at innovation. If you think about our business around the world, we have quite a rhythm of small innovation, new flavors, new sizes of packs, as we do PPA and RCM. But that leads to hundreds of small projects which do drive our business. But we are gradually eliminating probably close to half of those small projects because, in fact, over time, they don't have that much of an impact on the business. Since overall, our business is doing well, we can afford to do so. And we are shifting our focus to bigger innovation projects. So the ones that I would mention is, first of all, making healthier versions of our mainstream products. So I'm referring to, for instance, what you've seen so far, an Oreo gluten-free or Oreo zero sugar in China, gluten-free in the U.S., doing quite well. And you can expect that we will continue expand those efforts across other brands. Then we are entering quite significantly in cakes and pastries. And there you can expect us to push quite hard. And so you could see the OREO Cakesters or the Oreo Airy Cake in China. And these are all significant innovations that have the potential or tens of millions of dollars of net revenue per country. We're pushing hard on premium chocolate, so we launched, for instance, the [Toblerone pralines] (ph), or we have done some big innovations on our core chocolate tablet. So these are bigger innovations that require more work, higher potential, but we are reshifting our efforts towards those. So I don't know if I would call that what you were asking, Alexia. Do we see picked up the pace of innovation? I think the impact of innovation on our growth will increase in the coming years, but it's not driven by more innovation, it's driven by better innovation, I would say. Alexia Howard : Very helpful. And then could I just follow up finally? Do you have any observations about the state of the American consumer? I think we've heard from other companies that there's been down trading. There's vulnerability. There's channel shifting. I'm just wondering if any of -- whether some of the challenges that you're seeing in North America are being driven by this consumer dynamic. Dirk Van De Put : Yes, everything you're saying is true. Let me explain it a little bit. I would say the consumer, as it relates from a behavior standpoint, as in the fourth quarter show the biggest shifts, and I can explain a little bit the shifts that we've seen. But from a mindset perspective, from a confidence perspective in North America, probably the best in the last 2.5 years. So what they're doing is still reflecting sort of the tension they're under, but they are expecting the economy to improve and that better times are ahead for them. So what are they doing? We see a little bit more of an elasticity effect. And the way they react to that is they're waiting more. We see particularly light buyers waiting for promotion. So not buying with the same frequency, but buying more when it's on promotion. We see them downsizing, going to smaller formats and buying more of those. We see shift in channels. They go to club channels, e-commerce channels, that's the one we see winning. And then we have a number of sort of mechanical effects that we're seeing, particularly the snap reduction in the U.S. And so we see less disposable income for a certain group of consumers. But overall, I would say we expect that that gradually will improve because of that mindset change that I was saying. So the overall volume expectations as the year goes by in the US, we're expecting to accelerate and to get better. That's a little bit our view on the US consumer at the moment. Alexia Howard : Great. Thank you very much. I'll hand it back to you. Dirk Van De Put : All right, thank you. Well, thank you. I think that was the last question. As we said, we feel very good about '23. It was a great year for us. We are entering '24 with good momentum. I think we're prepared for everything that we are seeing ahead of it. And as I said, there is some issues that we have to look at. But despite all that and including those effects into our forecast for the year, we think that we're going to have a strong year. We'll see how the client disruption goes in Europe. So we have to wait a little bit to see how the first quarter goes by. But overall, we think we will have an on to the higher side of our algorithm year at this stage that we can forecast. Again, thank you, and happy to answer any other questions that you would have through our IR department. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, everyone. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Shep Dunlap : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO; and Luca Zaramella, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K, Q and 8-K filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. As we discuss our results today, unless noted as reported, we'll be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures, which adjust for certain items included in our GAAP results. In addition, we provide our year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. You can find the comparable GAAP measures and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation. Today, Dirk will provide a business and strategy update, followed by a review of our financial results and outlook by Luca. We will close with Q&A. I'll now turn the call over to Dirk. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you, Shep, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. I will start on Slide 4. I'm pleased to share that 2024 is off to a solid start with strong profit delivery. We posted solid top line results in the first quarter, coupled with strong earnings and free cash flow generation. We continue to see momentum in emerging markets where consumer confidence remains strong and our categories remain resilient. There were a number of one-off factors that affected our sales in the quarter such as the disruption with some of our European clients and the boycott of Western products in the Middle East and Southeast Asia. We delivered another quarter of strong gross profit dollar growth through ongoing cost discipline and sound pricing. And we also continued our track record of strong free cash flow generation of more than $1 billion this quarter. To accelerate our strategy of global snacking leadership and drive sustainable long-term growth, we are continuing to invest significantly in our brands and capabilities, driving distribution gains and harnessing synergies from our recently acquired assets. While our operating environment remains challenging and dynamic, our teams are focused and agile in dealing with the short term as well as executing against our long-term growth strategy. While surprising, but temporary, the cocoa inflation does not affect the fact that our categories remain durable and our growth opportunities remain sizable. Turning to Slide 5. You can see that organic net revenue grew 4.2% this quarter with adjusted gross profit dollar growth of 11.6%, enabling us to continue investing in the business. We continue to increase our A&C spending year-over-year in the high single digits, which is driving consumer and customer loyalty for our iconic global brands as well as our local jewels. Adjusted EPS grew 16.3%, and we generated $1 billion in free cash flow. While many food and beverage segments are showing softness so far this year, and I'm now on Slide 6, our core categories of chocolate, biscuit and baked snacks are still demonstrating relatively more resilience and lower elasticity than the broader food universe. Consumer confidence varies by region with North America and Australia, New Zealand mixed, while Europe is improving and emerging markets remains strong. Shoppers in many markets are becoming increasingly sensitive to the absolute price point, driving them to choose smaller pack sizes in both biscuits and chocolate. And at the same time, consumers in our snacking categories remain very loyal to the brands they know and love. In North America, we're seeing increased promotional intensity combined with a significant shift in sales to non-tracked channels, including club stores, dollar stores and emerging e-commerce platforms. Lower income consumers feel pressured, and we see that pressure weighing on their frequency in the category, especially among brands that skew more to that group. In Europe, consumer confidence is stable. While volume growth has slowed, the chocolate and biscuit categories are holding better than the broader FMCG landscape, and we're hearing increased optimism about the go-forward economic outlook. Emerging markets remain a strong growth driver, with consumer confidence driving resilient demand and low elasticity. Consumers in emerging markets are particularly interested in premium offers, enabling us to expand our range with new on-trend formats and pack sizes. Turning to Slide 7. It is important to underscore that despite short-term marketplace volatility, we remain focused on advancing our long-term growth strategy by reinvesting in our brands and people, driving strong execution, reshaping our portfolio and scaling sustainable snacking. We continue to increase our focus on our attractive and resilient core categories of chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks, and we remain on track to deliver 90% of revenue through these core categories by 2030. For example, we're investing significantly to support our Cadbury brand's 200th anniversary in the United Kingdom this year, with a multichannel consumer activation promoting the brand promise of generosity. At the same time, we're strengthening store availability, visibility and execution around the world. During the first quarter alone, we added around 100,000 directly served stores in emerging markets. We are also harnessing the power of recent acquisitions by capturing synergies and driving growth. For example, we successfully completed a significant system integration in our Ricolino business this quarter, which boosts our ability to fully leverage the expanded routes to market in Mexico, particularly in the traditional trade. The combined Mondelez and Ricolino system paves the way for significantly expanded distribution in key categories, including chocolate. Additionally, we are making continued progress on our environmental and social sustainability agenda. Just a few weeks ago, we earned validation for our net zero by 2050 road map from the Science-Based Targets initiative, demonstrating that we are on the right path towards combating climate change. We also delivered significant improvements in advancing our mindful snacking priorities, including enhancing nutrient and ingredient profiles, promoting active lifestyles, and empowering consumers to make more mindful eating choices. I do encourage you to read our annual Snacking Made Right report, now available on our website, to learn more about our sustainability strategy and to review our full year sustainability performance data. Before I turn the microphone over to Luca, on Slide 8, I'd like to spend a few minutes putting the recent headlines about cocoa prices and chocolates into perspective. We're playing for the long term in chocolate because it is fundamentally a great category, with very high brand loyalty and low private label penetration. And within this great category, our business is strong and agile. Record costs for cocoa ingredients and the resulting current and future price increases for customers and consumers obviously are generating substantial discussion. Despite this near-term headwind, chocolate volume continues to grow. And within this growing category, we remain structurally advantaged with large opportunities still ahead. We are confident in our chocolate business for 4 main reasons : our cocoa coverage strategies, our approach to pricing, our supply chain, and our iconic brands. First, it is important to underscore that our coverage strategies have proven advantage versus market dynamics in the last few months. We are fully covered for 2024 and well protected heading into 2025. Our teams continue to monitor the market very closely to put ourselves in the best position possible. While poor weather and other factors on the supply and demand side have driven prices to unprecedented levels, we believe there will eventually be a market adjustment. We are confident that our teams are putting in place the right strategies to provide future flexibility. Luca will provide some additional details in a few minutes. Second, we continue to implement sound pricing strategies, including both headline pricing and revenue growth management. We remain agile in balancing the need to offset inflation with the need to maintain solid volume dynamics. We are especially focused on protecting critical price points, including low unit price and other key threshold prices. Third, we remain confident in our supply chain. Continuity remains our top priority, and we are confident in both our own team and our partners with robust work streams to minimize the risk. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we have some of the strongest, most iconic chocolate brands in the world, including Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka, C\u00f4te d'Or, Marabou, Freia and Lacta, to name a few. These brands already are the leaders in numerous key markets, and we are well positioned to accelerate growth in emerging markets. Our research shows that consumers remain extremely loyal to our great brands because chocolate plays an important role in their lives, helping to bring families together, celebrate key milestones and to enjoy some quiet me-time. In our annual State of Snacking survey conducted in partnership with The Harris Poll, 72% of consumers across 12 countries said that a world without chocolate would be a world without joy. Nearly 60% said that they would rather give up social media for a month than give up chocolate. Our iconic portfolio, strong brand loyalty and advantaged geographic footprint make us particularly well positioned to take advantage of these consumer trends. In summary, we're confident that we are well equipped to navigate a relatively short-term headwind and that we're structurally advantaged to accelerate long-term growth in this category. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca to share additional insights on our financials. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Dirk, and good afternoon. Q1 marked a solid quarter for our business, with organic revenue growth across each region, strong profit dollar growth, substantial investment into A&C and great free cash flow generation. Revenue grew 4.2% with strong pricing execution. Volume/mix was varied for the quarter, with emerging markets flat despite being impacted by some political unrest in the Middle East and some production slowdowns in Mexico related to Ricolino being integrated into SAP. We expect both issues to subside throughout the year, and specifically Ricolino is almost back on track. On the other side, developed market volume/mix was down 3.6% for the quarter, being impacted mostly by Europe customer disruption and the U.S. biscuit market softness. On the customer front in Europe, we are happy to report that about 90% of the pricing is now implemented. One relevant customer alliance is still pending. Total revenue for emerging markets grew plus 8.3%, underpinned by strength across a number of key markets. While developed markets grew 1.4%, with solid results from Europe despite customer disruption and strength from our North America growth channels and Canada. Moving to portfolio performance on Slide 11. Biscuits and baked snacks grew 0.6% for the quarter. A number of brands delivered solid growth, including OREO, Ritz, Perk and 7Days. On the flip side, we have seen ongoing softness in U.S. biscuits driven primarily by brands that had higher penetration among lower-income households such as Chips Ahoy! This dynamic has impacted frequency and contributed to the decline in volume/mix. Chocolate grew 5.8% with significant growth across both developed and emerging markets. Vol/mix was down 1.6% driven by customer disruption in Europe. Cadbury Dairy Milk posted strong growth, while we saw solid increases from Milka despite customer disruption. There is an element of Easter timing in these results, but we believe it to be immaterial. We also delivered solid growth with several of our local jewels, including Lacta in Brazil, Freia in Norway, Marabou in Sweden, and Hu in the U.S. Gum and candy grew 12.9% driven by continued momentum and strength in key markets, including China, Mexico and Western Andean. Let's review market share performance on Slide 12. We held or gained share in 40% of our revenue base with strength in chocolate as well as in gum and candy. This trend was offset by softer results in our U.S. biscuits business. Turning to regional performance on Slide 13. Europe grew 4.4% in Q1. Execution was strong in the quarter, with a number of key countries delivering strong growth through solid pricing and excellent Easter execution, which led to share gains. This trend was partially offset by volume declines associated with expected customer disruption, while dollars were up more than 20% and including significant A&C investments. We have now landed the vast majority of pricing in Europe. One customer alliance is still ongoing, which will cause some additional disruption in Q2, but the business remains in line with our expectations. North America grew 1.3% against an exceptionally strong compare of more than 16% in Q1 last year. Growth channels, including club and e-commerce and Canada, delivered strong results. However, overall volume/mix declined as a result of ongoing softness in food and mass. This softness has been consistent with the overall market and driven primarily by less frequency from lower income households. We are working to ensure our offers and activations continue to provide value to this consumer's cohort. And we continue to build that into our plans moving forward. We remain encouraged by our activation plans in key products such as OREO, TDP expansion and growth channels as we move through the year. North America OI increased by 2.1%. AMEA grew 5.9% for the quarter. China delivered another strong quarter with low double-digit growth fueled by initiatives to enhance brand equity in OREO, Chips Ahoy! and Stride. India grew high single digits driven by continued strength in chocolate and distribution gains. While Australia, New Zealand and Japan also delivered a robust quarter for growth, coupled with strong share gains. Like last quarter, volume cost in the Middle East and Southeast Asia impacted results. We believe this dynamic will begin to moderate in the second quarter and the remainder of the year. AMEA increased OI dollars by 20.2%, continuing a strong track record of top and bottom line growth. Latin America grew 7.1% with strong price execution and a slight volume/mix decline of minus 1.2%. It's important to note that Argentina is now capped at 26%. And this is not reflected in the base year comparison for Latin America. Argentina contributed more than 11 points to Latin America growth in Q1 '23 but only 1.8 points in Q1 '24. So we expect the underlying growth rate in Lat Am to appear understated for this year. Having said that, reported dollars growth continue to be strong for this segment. Volume/mix was softer in the quarter primarily due to some product availability in Mexico associated with the Ricolino that resulted in some production temporary slowdowns. These issues are mostly behind us, but we're still working to rebuild inventory. Consumer confidence and demand in Mexico remains quite robust, and we expect to see improved volumes as supply chain catches up as Q2 progresses. Brazil, WACOM continued to be strong, both in terms of volume/mix and revenue, while Argentina is impacted by unprecedented inflation and subsequent pricing and volume softness. Latin America delivered OI growth of more than 33%. Strong pricing and the continuation of gum and candy momentum drove these results.  Turning to Page 14. In Q1, we saw strong double-digit OI and gross profit dollar growth of more than $380 million driven by top line strength and ongoing cost efficiency. It is important to note that the impact of cost inflation will be a more significant headwind in the remaining quarters than what we saw in Q1 as a result of our favorable cocoa pipeline compared to the current market prices.  Next, to EPS on Slide 15. Q1 EPS grew more than 16% in constant currency. Most of this growth was driven by operating gains. And despite some currency headwinds, we grew adjusted EPS as reported ForEx by 10.5%.  Turning to Slide 16 and cash flow. We delivered $1 billion of free cash flow for the quarter. We also repurchased $600 million in stock during the quarter. We will continue to remain opportunistic for the remainder of the year as it relates to share buybacks. Our balance sheet also remains strong as leverage ended at about 2.5x.  Before moving to our outlook, let me take a moment to discuss cocoa on Slide 18. First, our coverage strategies have proven advantageous versus market dynamics in the last few months. We are fully covered for '24 and also for a portion of half 1 2025. Typically, we are covered for 12-plus months, but given recent volatility, we have remained slightly shorter in duration.  Our teams continue to monitor the market very closely to put ourselves in the best position possible. It is obvious that the series of conditions of both supply and demand side have driven costs up at unprecedented levels. We believe there will eventually be a market adjustment. And while we want to protect ourselves, we are putting in place flexible structures that will allow us to participate to potential upside versus current historically high prices. On the other side, we continue to execute against our pricing strategies to offset input cost inflation using both the landed price and revenue growth management. Chocolate has shown strong growth over the past several years with very durable volume and elasticity despite significant pricing, particularly as we have some of the strongest brands in the category. However, we will remain agile in our approach to pricing in order to balance the need to offset inflation with the need to maintain solid volume dynamics. This means we will protect critical price points such as low unit price and key thresholds across our footprint. We also remain confident in our supply chain. Supply chain remains priority 1. And we are confident in our supply chain and that of our partners with ongoing work streams to minimize risks.  Turning to our outlook on Slide 19. Our outlook for 2024 remains unchanged. We continue to expect on-algo delivery for revenue, earnings per share and cash flow. This includes the upper end of our 3% to 5% range for organic net revenue growth, which continues to factor in ongoing customer disruption in Europe and softer growth in parts of the U.S.  Most of our key assumptions remain consistent with what we shared with you in our last call. We continue to expect a high single-digit inflation in '24. Although the vast majority of pricing has been landed in Europe, we continue to expect some level of customer disruption in Q2 associated with our annual price negotiation process. Interest expense is now expected to be approximately $300 million for the year. We are expecting $0.10 of EPS headwinds related to ForEx impact.  In terms of tax rate, we continue to expect an adjusted effective tax rate in the mid-20s. Share repurchase is expected to be $2 billion with an opportunistic approach.  With that, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Kenneth Goldman : You highlighted a few of the challenges in North America at the moment. Just as we think about the path ahead maybe, how are you considering some of the more important actions that can be taken to protect share, maybe in light of some of the challenges at the lower end consumer and also given your comments about globally sort of protecting some of the price points that are out there? I'm just trying to get a sense for the tactics that might be implemented. Dirk Van de Put : Yes, Ken. I mean you see that the category is slowing down and that we are losing a little bit of share. I think everybody knows that the consumer is sort of seeing a number of things : the persistent inflation, there is the high interest rate, there is the loss of the SNAP, and there's also the recent not-so-great job market. So consumer confidence, which was so and so up to today, I think now we just learned that it took a real dive this month. We see in our categories, the elasticity is really going up. Penetration is still pretty good, but people are much more cautious about price points. The frequency is coming down, particularly with the lower income consumers and particularly the brands that are important for them. Like Chips Ahoy!, we can see that they're losing some market share to private label. There is, as I just said, some trade-down to private label.  And then another thing to keep in mind is that there's some big channel shifts taking place to club or online or into the value channel. So what are we doing about it? The first thing is that we, last year, didn't have a great performance in TDP. So going forward, we are increasing our TDPs, which will help our volumes going forward and our market share. For those lower income consumers who are buying very carefully and evaluating very carefully when and what and at which price they buy, we will need to become more agile in the promo mechanisms that we will play out, and we're working hard on finding what works best for us. And this is kind of different, brand by brand and largely talking about what we do on our base packs here. We will continue to invest in our brands because we increased prices also in March, so we will increase our investment. We are launching a number of special packs, a number of additional multipacks. But also, for instance, in CLIF, we are reducing the size of our multipacks from 6 to 5 or from 12 to 10 units in a multipack, which will help the price points we're selling it. And so that gives you a little bit of an idea of what we are planning to do going forward. We assume that in the second half of the year, the consumers will have a better confidence and that we will see gradually the volume and the market shares to come back. Kenneth Goldman : Great. And then, Luca, as we look at the remainder of the year, especially just modeling 2Q in particular, are there any unusual puts and takes that maybe aren't fully or properly factored into Street forecast? Anything we should be more considerate of that maybe we're not yet? Luca Zaramella : I don't think that's necessarily the case, Ken. I mean we feel good about reaffirming at this point our original guidance for 2024. And while it is true that the biscuit category in the U.S. is a little bit softer, we are overall happy with most of the dynamics we see around the world. Importantly, for us, Chinese New Year and Easter were quite good. And these are critical consumption events for us, but you should expect categories to continue their trends into Q2 and the latter part of the year.  I want to spend a minute talking about pricing. We are at this point, in total, where we should be. We have implemented the price that we targeted everywhere, including Europe. We still have one main customer to finalize in Europe, which is leading to some disruption in Q2. So you should expect that. But overall, in terms of pricing, we are where we had anticipated to be by now. Inflation is, in total, in line with what we expected. And by now, we have locked cocoa for the entirety of 2024. So we have quite a good visibility on cost. I would have a special call-out here because cocoa costs will escalate throughout the year, particularly in the second half. The acquisitions, we started a little bit softer than expected, particularly in CLIF, and I called out some temporary issues in Ricolino, but you should see a sequential improvement throughout the year. Maybe another couple of points to bear in mind. Elasticities are planned in line with what we have seen in Q1, but we might see a little bit of an uptick, particularly in chocolate. But as we mentioned a few times, we will continue to support our brands. And we will not vacate critical price points, particularly in emerging markets. And we have planned for the same type of softness that we have seen in Q1 as far as the biscuit category goes. But we would expect our share to improve over time as we are revisiting some of the promo mechanics, particularly around brands like Chips Ahoy!. I mentioned that Ricolino is already recovering. So we should see good growth in Latin America going forward. And finally, as far as earnings call, we continue to make progress in removing stranded costs related to the gum business. So I don't expect any particular change in dynamics into Q2 specifically, but we should see, particularly on volume, some sequential improvement as we go through the year, as we land some of the price negotiations, particularly in Europe. Operator : We'll take our next question from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Bryan Spillane : So my first question is just can you give us a little bit more color or perspective on emerging markets? I mean you talked about in the prepared remarks how the elasticities have been pretty good, considering how much pricing. So I guess, as we're thinking about balance of the year and just contribution to growth in the back half of the year, just if you can give us a little bit more color on emerging markets and how we should be thinking about that. Dirk Van de Put : Yes. Well, just to situate, about 40% of our sales growth in emerging markets was about 8% in Q1. We are seeing growth in reported dollars, top and bottom line, so solid, robust performance.  If I look at the different markets, China, we had low double-digit growth with strong share gains. You know that China for us is a combination of selling more in the stores where we already are but also a big drive in distribution. That will continue for the rest of the year. And we expect that China will be strong. India, we had high single digits. Same sort of dynamics, continue to increase our share in the market and increasing our distribution. India probably won't show the same amount of growth that we've seen in previous years, we expect a bit of a slowdown there, but still expecting a positive year in India.  Then Mexico, Luca already commented, Mexico was low single digits driven by some issues with the system implementation in merging Ricolino with our business, but we are gaining shares. Our offtake is good. We had some issues in supplying the market. And now that the system is done, we will really start to work that route to market expansion. So we're expecting, once we get through these short-term issues, that we will see some strong growth in Mexico. And then Brazil was mid-single digits, gaining share, a pretty good gain in distribution, price points are a bit of a discussion there. But we also expect Brazil to look pretty good. So in the 4 biggest emerging markets for us, we feel pretty good about where they are and what we expect for the rest of the year. There are some watch-outs. There is inflationary pressure in Nigeria, Pakistan, Egypt. In the Middle East and Southeast Asia, we have the boycotts of Western products that are affecting us. So not everything is great. But we do believe that emerging markets this year will be giving us sustainable growth. We will get back to volume growth. We feel that the low category penetration that we have and the distribution opportunity that we have will drive this.  I think we are also gradually getting into the adjacencies. And we are able at this stage to continue our virtuous investment cycle where we continue to increase our investment every year. We get good growth. We generate more margin and the year after, we increase our investment. So overall, it's not going to be an incredible year in emerging markets, but it's going to be a very solid year for us in emerging markets. Bryan Spillane : And Luca, just one quick one on cocoa. I know here, our trading desk kind of has a view that we might be closer to $5,000 by the end of the year. So I guess, to the extent that there's an expectation that cocoa prices come down, does it pay for you to just sort of wait to hedge? I guess it's kind of like shorting cocoa. But just I think last year, you might have held out until the middle of the year before you started locking in. Just kind of curious how we should be thinking about and observing what you may be doing to start thinking about cocoa in '25? Luca Zaramella : That's a very good question. So we truly believe that current cocoa prices are the results of a series of accidental circumstances that over time, we believe, should go away. I think you all know that the main crop last year was problematic. But as you might have read from multiple sources, the mid-crop is already looking much better. But also on the other side, on the demand side, the industry went a little bit shorter than usual on coverage and now, by out of necessity to replenish minimum stocks, really provide support to the current high prices. I think in this context, we truly believe that the current market structure does not warrant the current market prices. And so the question becomes when is the correction going to take place. And most likely, the answer is in September, October as the data for the new crop becomes available. We cannot stay still until then. We will have to protect ourselves. But our implementation strategy for 2025 is around flexibility. And so we are putting in place very flexible structures, namely pure vanilla call options. We bought a few where price of those options was very affordable, I would say, particularly in light of today's prices. But we are putting in place multiple structures that would allow us to participate in a potential market correction.  So you're absolutely right. We believe the market is overreacting. The current prices are not sustainable. And should the correction happen, which we expect towards the end of Q3, most likely, we will be ready to take advantage of lower prices. Now I don't want to give you the false impression that we are not going to have inflation in cocoa in '25 because reality is, in 2024, we are covered at materially better prices than current market. So you might want to take a look at the total mark-to-market in the noncash to adjusted GAAP results. Bryan Spillane : Yes. Appreciate that. Yes, we were looking at that. Actually, Pete Galbo pointed out to me just how big the gain was, so definitely, I get that piece. Operator : We'll take our next question from Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Robert Moskow : I guess one of the more pleasant surprises is that European chocolate retail data looks very, very strong. The elasticity looks de minimis. And I want to know if you think that will help in your negotiations with retailers heading into 2025. Are the retailers happy with how the category is performing, how the consumer is handling the pricing so far? Does that help at all? Dirk Van de Put : Yes. So of course, it does help in the sense that so far, the elasticity is relatively benign. We've got a good performance. Despite some disruptions, growth has been solid, I would say, and we have increased our market share. We do have to take into account that Easter came earlier. We had a very strong Easter from our side, but it came early. So some of the numbers you're seeing are influenced versus last year, we didn't have an earlier Easter. But overall, I would say that this certainly is better than you would have expected. It shouldn't be a surprise in a way because we know that the chocolate market can be very resilient. We also are continuing to invest quite heavily. And consumer confidence in Europe, I would say, is stable. There is some uptick in elasticity. But overall, it's is better than you would have expected and maybe even a little bit more positive than what we currently are seeing in U.S. Going forward, I think it helps to see a strong category that we are performing well. Of course, the retailers see the cocoa pricing as well as we do. So it will help the discussions going forward. I wouldn't say that it's going to be simple, but there will be an understanding that if cocoa prices remain relatively high, that there will need to be more price increases that need to be implemented. And I think we're helped by the data that we can provide.  And we also have to see what's going to happen with elasticity going forward as the new chocolate prices get implemented because when you have seasonal like Easter, the consumer not necessarily is fully aware of the price difference. When they start to see their tablet now in the normal shelf, that's when they will fully realize elasticity. So we will need to see where that is heading. But overall, yes, very positive on what is going on with chocolate in Europe. Operator : We'll take our next question from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Stephen Robert Powers : Great. I want to talk a bit of about the gross margin. I thought coming into this year, you actually expected the gross margin to start out slower in the first quarter and actually sort of improved year-over-year as we went into the year. It seems like we're setting up for a different, maybe an opposite, dynamic. So maybe you could just expand on what drove the gross margin higher this quarter and then how you expect the cadence of gross margin to evolve over the course of the year. Luca Zaramella : Yes. So as I said, both in the prepared remarks and in my first answer to Ken's question, we are very happy with the level of pricing we have taken so far. And so we are absolutely on plan. On the cost side, I commented about the fact that the cocoa price escalation will be more visible in the second part of the year. So I'm not sure you will continue seeing the type of gross profit dollar expansion and gross margin that you saw in Q1 into the second half because the cocoa prices will hit a little bit harder particularly in Q4.  So I wouldn't read too much into that. I think the way you have to think about it is, are we happy with expanding gross profit dollars almost 12%? Absolutely. Are we happy with the reported dollar gross profit that we see? Absolutely. We are pricing in a very disciplined manner around the world. We are doing RGMs. So that is bearing its fruit. But you're going to see some compression, particularly in Q4. So don't expect like 2.5 points of gross profit expansion from now to the end of the year for sure. Stephen Robert Powers : Yes. Okay. Very good. And actually, Dirk, if I could build on your comments just a minute ago on Europe. I'm curious, I mean, understanding that the retail negotiations have gone maybe a little bit better than you had originally assumed, but it seems like demand, as you say, is stable, maybe a little bit better than expected, I guess is it better than you would have expected? And if so, how does that influence your plans for the balance of the year? Are you leaning in a bit harder into Europe to take advantage of those better conditions? Dirk Van de Put : Yes. I would say, first of all, as it relates to the client negotiations, they largely are going exactly as we would have expected. As we knew that we had increased prices, we foresee that in our forecast for the year. And at the moment, it's playing out as expected. As Luca mentioned, there's still one buying group that we need to finish. Hopefully, we will do that in the coming weeks. And then we should be done for a while.  As it relates to the current situation in Europe, obviously, there will be a recuperation because we have not been delivering for a while with some clients. And as we get agreements, we start to fill the pipeline again. So that will help us. But overall, I would say that we are not expecting to see for the full year a big difference in our European performance. We're not expecting to see an upside. We are convinced that we have more stability, we feel more assured about delivering what we are expecting to deliver in Europe, but we're not counting yet on an upside for the year. Operator : We'll take our next question from Alexia Howard with Bernstein.  Our next question comes from Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Christopher Carey : Dirk, in the comments that you made around the consumer in North America, elasticity is picking up a little bit and some expectations into Q2 and the back half of the year. I guess I'm just trying to understand a couple of things. First, in Q1, is there anything within the portfolio that you would deem not elasticity related? You mentioned some competitive activity in CLIF that you're going to be responding to. Say, anything competitively or fundamentally that you would point to that you would see improving into Q2 where it gives you a little bit of confidence in North America? And then the second thing would just be regarding the consumer into the back half of the year. Did I catch you right that there's an expectation that the consumer in North America gets a little bit better and that your volume trends as such should improve sequentially? So perhaps just any help on portfolio dynamics in the quarter and also just, I guess, more like the macro and the consumer. Dirk Van de Put : Yes. Well, I would say that if you look at the market share evolution, the brand that's most affected is Chips Ahoy!, and Chips Ahoy! is the most susceptible to private label. And OREO or a belVita are gaining market share. And so I would say if there's anything that's pointing -- I wouldn't call it necessarily not susceptible to elasticity. We see some elasticity on those brands, too. But overall, the activations that we have and the interest we're getting from the consumer on those 2 brands offset the elasticity effect that we're having.  As it relates to what we need to do going forward, it's largely now trying to figure out in which way can we get the frequency, particularly from the lower income consumer that we would like to see. So price points certainly play a role, and we will need to work short term with promotions; longer term, probably working on the size of our packs to make sure that we hit those right price points. Because if we see anything in the elasticity, it is that we have surpassed certain price points and that is having a big effect.  Now I would say that movement is happening already. So that's what we gradually will expect to improve in the coming months, i.e., that our promotional and pricing strategy gets better, that we understand better how to get the frequency and the volume from the consumer. I'm also expecting that the overall consumer confidence in the second half of the year will improve. That will have an effect for us. There is a lapping effect. Last year, we had 16% growth in North America. Of course, that plays a role. The lapping later in the year will be easier. Those are the things that I would see that make me believe that the second half of the year will look better for us in North America. Christopher Carey : Okay. One quick follow-up on cocoa. Luca, you gave a lot of helpful commentary around some of the things that you're going to be doing or are doing now contractually and you also have an expectation in September and October. I guess the question is, what if cocoa sustains these really high levels and we don't see the fundamental break expected going into next year, is it still appropriate to think about pricing as the core mechanism to cover the inflation? Or given the lead time that you have to prepare, maybe there are other alternatives like accelerated savings, RGM, the sorts of things that you can do when you have many months to prepare for such cycles, if indeed, you believe that the cocoa prices at some point will eventually break. So it's just more game theory, but any context on that would be helpful. Luca Zaramella : Yes, I believe it's absolutely critical for us to get ready for potentially cocoa staying at these levels. I just want, though, to call out one thing, which is the forward curve for cocoa is heavily inverted. And that means in general that even today, we could potentially get physical coverage into '25 but at cheaper prices than the current spot price that we see today. But rest assured that as a company, we are looking at all possible scenarios. And as a matter of fact, we are taking a fresher look at some of the costs we have, making sure that we try to understand the level of flexibility that we have. We are looking thoroughly into additional RGM. We will stay absolutely true to the concept of protecting price point, particularly in emerging markets. We are not going to move the LUP, low unit price, points in India, for instance. But we will be looking into potential RGM in terms of promo, in terms of downsizing, et cetera, so to say that we will have to make sure that elasticity stays in control. In the end, we are going to be managing '25 in light of what we think a more plausible cocoa level is, despite the fact that it might still be very high because we fundamentally believe that in a couple of years' time, tops, the cocoa price will correct. And at that point in time, we will have to have retained our volume, our share, our competitive advantage both in developed and in emerging markets. And that's the way we are looking at these. But rest assured, we are looking at all possible scenarios, and we're going to be sitting down soon with the teams to make sure that we put in place already all the possible actions that would allow us to go through a potential worst-case scenario in 2025. Operator : We'll take our next question from Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Robert Dickerson : Can you hear me? Luca Zaramella : Yes. Dirk Van de Put : Yes. Robert Dickerson : Sorry about that. So just one quick one on cocoa again, Luca. Just in terms of your comments around maybe the mid-crop coming in a little bit better, your kind of expectation, maybe things could ease and improve a little bit kind of in the almost pre-main crop period. I mean kind of what you're saying is just the expectation here is that supply should be up, right? I mean we're clearly running at a deficit, but then we should assume that supply should be up in the next main crop. Is that fair? Luca Zaramella : Yes, I think that's fair. I mean when you look closely at the numbers, Ivory Coast and Ghana, the main crop was down year-on-year about 20%. The total cocoa supply was positive as it were. In total, it was down minus 10%. Do I expect the main crop to be down 20% in Africa or 10% in total again? I don't think that's a plausible scenario at this point in time. But as I said, we will know more as we get closer to the main crop. But fundamentally, nothing has really happened that structurally impairs the production capability of Africa specifically to that level. So yes, I'm hopeful that there will be a better main crop, and I think you will see prices for cocoa adjusting.  Having said that, we are looking into all possible scenarios, and we're going to be implementing some opportunities that we see before year-end. But we'll have to wait for us to be able to tell you what those are. And I think as we move throughout the year, we'll keep you updated on what we see for cocoa into 2025. Robert Dickerson : All right, lovely. And then just quickly on the top line, I think originally, Q1, you had said, might be below the algo for the year just kind of given some of the European disruption. But I think Europe did better than we all probably saw it. North America is a bit softer. So I'm just curious, are you still thinking there could be slightly positive volume/mix for the company for the year and then I think you also said likely for each of the segments once we x out some of the European disruptions? And then lastly, I think you had also originally said it was probably more high end than the 3% to 5% sales growth, so just curious on the volume piece and then if you're still at the high end. Luca Zaramella : Look, the volume piece is we expect volume to be flattish for the year. Reality is, as we gave guidance, we had a little bit of headroom, as you might expect. I think that headroom is still, for the most part, there. We'll have to see how a couple of ticket items play out for the remainder of the year, particularly the boycott in AMEA as it relates to some of our brands, how will that play out in the quarters to come. And the other thing is the share recovery, particularly in the U.S. I feel confident about the plans that the U.S. is putting in place. I think we are moving a little bit the price point of Chips Ahoy!, and that would allow us to recuperate share and volume. And Chips Ahoy! is the #1 driver of the volume declines that you see in the North American segment. But then we will have to see how elasticity plays out as well.  I feel quite good about the Latin American business. As I called out, I think 3 out of the 4 business units, and the only one that is declining in volume in real terms, is Argentina. But the other 3 are doing quite well. We feel good about China. I think India, we're going to see some slowdowns. But all in all, it should be fine. And then I could go around the globe and tell you that reality is once we land the final customer in Europe, we hopefully see some reviving of the trade stock. And hopefully, the chocolate market will continue displaying acceptable elasticity. So a long answer to say expect flattish volume, but in reality, there are some puts and takes and we want to keep some flexibility within the plan. Operator : And this does conclude our Q&A segment. I will turn the call to our speakers for any closing comments. Dirk Van de Put : Well, thank you for assisting in the call. I will conclude with saying that we had a solid first quarter, and we feel confident for the rest of the year that we will have an on-algorithm year. And looking forward, if you have any questions, our IR department will be happy to help you. And looking forward to see you next quarter for the results that we have then. Thank you. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, everyone. Operator : This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day and welcome to the Mondelez International Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Mondelez management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Vice -- Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondelez. Please go ahead, sir. Shep Dunlap : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO; and Luca Zaramella, our CFO. Earlier today we sent out our press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. As we discuss our results today, unless noted as reported, we'll be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures, which adjust for certain items included in our GAAP results. In addition, we provide year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis, unless otherwise noted. You can find the comparable GAAP measures and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation. Today, Dirk will provide a business strategy update, followed by a review of our financial results and outlook by Luca. We will close with Q&A. I'll now turn the call over to Dirk. Dirk Van de Put : Thanks, Shep, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. I will start on Slide 4. I am pleased to share that we delivered a solid first half to the year with strong profit dollar growth driven by effective cost management and pricing. We also successfully completed our annual pricing in Europe, which helps position us well for the second half in terms of top line and volume growth. We continue to see momentum in emerging markets, and we're continuing to invest significantly in our brands and capabilities to drive sustainable long-term growth. And we continued our track record of strong free cash flow, generating $1.5 billion. While our operating environment remains challenging and dynamic, our teams remain focused and agile in executing against our long-term growth strategy. We continue to play for the long term in chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks because these core categories remain strong consumer favorites with very high loyalty to our iconic brand portfolio. Within these great categories, our advantaged geographic footprint provides additional confidence that we are well positioned to compound long-term sustainable growth. Turning to Slide 5, you can see that organic net revenue grew 2.5% this quarter, with adjusted gross profit dollar growth of 11.3%, enabling us to continue investing in the business. A&C spending is up high single-digits, helping to drive consumer and customer loyalty to both our iconic global brands and our local jewels. And adjusted EPS grew 25%. Turning to Slide 6. While many food and beverage segments are continuing to experience softness, snacking remains relatively durable. Consumer trends vary by region, but overall we are seeing volume growth start to rebound as inflation cools. Consumer incomes are rising, which helps to reduce the inflation-driven financial strain on many households. As a result, private label growth in our categories is decelerating, while branded share growth is improving. In North America, some consumers are seeking snacking options at specific price points to fit within a specific overall ticket size. Other consumers, who are more focused on convenience, look for multipacks, which offer value, as well as variety and versatility. Our proven playbook for price pack architecture allows us to offer a broad range of options to meet each of these consumers' differing definitions of value. As a result, our two largest US brands, Oreo and Ritz, are gaining share year to date. Meanwhile, in Europe, elasticities are moving slightly higher but remain modest. Consumer confidence is cautiously optimistic and is rising in the second quarter versus the same period last year, as inflation softens and incomes rise behind stable employment. We continue to see positive value growth in biscuits and chocolates. Volume in seasonal chocolate also is growing well, up 0.6% year-to-date, driven by the performance of seasonal shapes, novelties and bite-sized products. Consumers continue to demonstrate that holidays like Easter just wouldn't be the same without chocolate and they are willing to spend accordingly. In emerging markets, modest elasticities continue. Our China business is delivering strong growth in online and social commerce. In Brazil, we're seeing an uptick in elasticities, but the consumer and economy remain resilient. In Mexico, the economic backdrop is healthy with solid employment and consumer confidence. And within India we see some food inflation impacting lower and middle income households driving a pullback in spend and causing some down trading, particularly in biscuits. Overall our combined emerging markets value and volume share is improving in biscuits and chocolate. Against this backdrop of gradually improving consumer confidence, as you can see on Slide 7, we are continuing to deliver against our focused action plan to improve volumes in North America in the second half of the year. We are already seeing value share improvement in Oreo and Ritz. To further accelerate growth, we are continuing to increase distribution points across food, club and convenience stores. And to meet the right price points, we are also implementing new targeted promotions, as well as a new pack size priced in the $3 to $4 range to drive continued brand loyalty and value for Oreo, Chips Ahoy!, and Ritz. Additionally, we're continuing to launch compelling activations, like Star Wars OREO and Oreo Space Dunk, to delight our fans while driving incremental lift. Turning to Slide 8, along with improving biscuit volumes in the second half, we are well positioned to deliver sustainable long-term growth in chocolate. Recent spikes in the cost of cocoa ingredients have been widely discussed, but we soon expect a market correction to a more sustainable price, as the mid-crop is emerging in line with historical trends, and early signs on the main crop are encouraging. Chocolate remains a great category. It is continuing to grow with volume resiliency and despite increasing prices. And within this great category, we offer some of the world's strongest, most iconic chocolate brands, which include Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka, Toblerone, C\u00f4te d'Or, Marabou, Freia, and Lacta. These brands are already the leaders in numerous key markets and we are continuing to invest in A&C to further accelerate loyalty and growth. At the same time, our proven RGM playbook provides our teams with the necessary agility in offsetting inflation while maintaining solid volume dynamics and protecting shares. We remain confident that we are well equipped to continue navigating fluctuating input costs and that we're structurally advantaged to accelerate long term chocolate growth. Turning to Slide 9, it is important to reinforce that while the external environment remains volatile, we remain focused on accelerating our long-term growth strategy. We're continuing to reinvest in our brands, expand distribution, drive M&A, and scale sustainable snacking. We remain on track to deliver 90% of revenue through our core categories of chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks by 2030. And our teams continue to deliver strong progress against our strategic agenda. For example, our Oreo marketing team continues to design and deliver exciting, creative activations that capitalize on consumer trends and drive incremental lift. We recently collaborated with Lucasfilm to launch two versions of a special edition Star Wars cookie in the United States, which unites our strong Oreo fan base with the equally strong Star Wars fan community. While both versions are wrapped in identical exterior packaging, consumers don't know which side they're on until they open the pack. This creative and fun approach is driving strong sales, making this collaboration our strongest limited edition yet. This collaboration is the latest example of our strategy to cement the cultural relevance of Oreo with key partners who help us bring their favorite stories to life. We're planning some more exciting, but still top secret, collaborations for the remainder of this year and into 2025. Along with these marketing activations, we are continuing to strengthen store availability, visibility and execution around the world. Here in the US, for instance, our performance in the club channel is growing mid-single-digits while the value channel is growing double digits. Both are driven by our family-sized multipacks which offer a great price per cookie or cracker rather than overall package prices. We also are continuing to harness the power of recent acquisitions to capture synergies and drive growth. For example our Chipita baked snacks business is growing high single-digit volume in Europe, led by convenient 7Days croissants that help satisfy consumers on the go across a broad range of snacking occasions. Additionally, we are making continued progress on our environmental and social sustainability agenda. For example, we continue implementing our structured and scientifically validated roadmap to reach net zero carbon by 2050. As an example, our biscuit manufacturing plant in East Suzhou, China was recently certified as carbon neutral. The plant has reduced carbon emissions by 16,000 tons, the equivalent of planting 7,000 trees for 100 years. Through implementing new technology solutions, including an innovative system to recycle residual heat and wastewater, as well as a new solar photovoltaic system to generate green electricity. To learn more about our strategy and review our annual performance data in detail, I encourage you to read our Snacking Made Right report available on our website. On Slide 10, before I turn the microphone over to Luca, I'd like to briefly highlight our recently announced strategic partnership with Lotus Bakeries. This exciting initiative includes two main components. First, we will work with Lotus Bakeries to develop and launch co-branded chocolate products combining unique caramelized crispy Biscoff taste with our iconic global chocolate brands, including Cadbury and Milka. We aim to launch the first products in Europe in early 2025. Second, we will manufacture, market, distribute and sell the Lotus Biscoff cookie brand in India starting in the second half of 2025. Partnering with Lotus will enable us to simultaneously scale our sweet biscuit business in the important emerging market of India while also innovating our strong European chocolate business with new products to grow consumer interest and loyalty. As we strive to lead the future of snacking by winning in chocolate biscuits and baked snacks, M&A and ventures remain an important part of our growth strategy. This innovative partnership is a great example of our approach and we continue to explore additional opportunities. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca to share additional insights on our financials. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Dirk, and good afternoon. Q2 marked a solid quarter for the business, with organic net revenue growth across each region, strong profit dollar growth, substantial reinvestment into working media, and robust free cash flow generation and capital return. Revenue grew plus 2.5% with strong pricing execution. This number includes 1.3 points of EU customer disruption that is now behind us and 40 basis points of boycott headwinds in our AMIA region. Developed market volume mix was down minus 2.2% for the quarter, primarily impacted by Europe customer disruption with some ongoing softness in the US Biscuit business. Total revenue for emerging markets grew plus 4.5%. Developed markets grew plus 1.2%. Moving to portfolio performance on Slide 13. Biscuits and baked snacks grew plus 0.8% for the quarter. Several brands delivered solid growth, including Oreo, Ritz, 7Days, Club Social, and TUC. We saw ongoing softness in parts of the US biscuit portfolio, though we have seen early signs of improvement in brands like Chips Ahoy! over recent weeks with clear plans to improve the overall biscuit growth enough to, as Dick mentioned. Chocolate grew plus 5.6% with significant growth across both developed and emerging markets. Volume mix was down minus 2.6%, which was nearly all driven by customer disruption in Europe. Cadbury Dairy Milk, Lacta in Brazil, and Freia and Marabou in the Nordics all posted strong growth during the quarter. Milka also posted solid growth. Gum and candy grew plus 2.9%, driven by continued momentum and strength in key markets including China, Brazil, and Western India. Volume mix in this category was negatively impacted by [calls] (ph) in the US. Let's review market share performance on Slide 14. We had or gained share in 40% of our revenue base with strength in chocolate as well as gum and candy. This strength was partially offset by softer results in our US biscuit business, which accounts for approximately 25 percentage points of revenue and disruption in key markets across Europe. Moving to regional performance on Slide 15, Europe grew plus 2.7% in Q2. Execution was strong in the quarter, with a number of key countries delivering growth through solid pricing and in-store execution, which led to share gains. This trend was partially offset by volume declines associated with expected customer disruption. Pricing is now completely in line with across all key customers, which positions as well for Q3 and half two of the year. OI dollars were up nearly 25%, including significant A&C investment. North America grew plus 0.3% against a strong compare of more than 12% in the prior year. Growth channels, including cloud, online and value, along with Canada, delivered solid growth. However, overall volume mix declined, as some consumers continue to seek out products with lower absolute price points, impacting brands like Chips Ahoy!. We have a clear plan to address this dynamic by adding more core packs in the Oreo, Chips Ahoy! and Ritz within the $3 to $4 range beginning in Q4, while other households continue to prepare the attractive unit price offerings that our family and party packs provide. And although early, a recent reformulation and new promotions have led to gradual sales improvement in Chips Ahoy!. There is clearly more work to do, but these initial signs are encouraging. North America OI increased by plus 3.4%. AMIA grew plus 4.2% for the quarter. China delivered another strong quarter with high single-digit growth fueled by ongoing brand equity enhancements in Oreo, Chips Ahoy!, and Stride, along with distribution gains. India was flat overall, with strong chocolate growth offset by more competitive intensity and down-trading in biscuit as a result of higher overall food inflation. Our India team has plans to activate new pack sizes and new value pricing within Oreo to improve growth and share starting next month. Australia, New Zealand and Japan delivered a robust quarter of growth coupled with strong share gains. Boycotting the Middle East and Southeast Asia remain a headwind to results, which we expect will continue in half two, though this impact will be in the base beginning in Q4. The overall impact for the region was 2 percentage points worth of growth. AMIA increased OI dollars by more than 46% with meaningful ANC increases. Gross base growth coupled with some upsides related to Latin Nigeria currency losses last year drove this performance. Latin America grew plus 4.5% with solid price execution and a decline in volume mix. Note that Argentina pricing has been capped at 26% unlike Q2 last year where the country contributed more than 15 points to Latin American growth. Brazil and our Western Andean region both delivered mid-single-digit growth. Mexico growth was modest, in part due to lower flow of public subsidies to households that is expected to resume in the second half. Consumer confidence remains strong in Mexico, while Brazil and the Western India countries continue to demonstrate solid growth. Latin America delivered OI growth of nearly plus 24% supported by strong pricing. Turning to Page 16, In Q2, we saw strong double digit OI and gross profit dollar growth. Top line strength, pricing execution, ongoing cost discipline partly drove these results. Nevertheless, the strong half-one results also reflect our favorable cocoa pipeline compared to current market prices, which will clearly reverse and will be a meaningful headwind in the second half. Next to EPS on Slide 17. Q2 EPS grew plus 25% in constant currency. Most of this growth was driven by operating gains, as well as favorable cocoa cost pipeline and coverage strategies. And despite currency headwinds, we grew adjusted EPS at reported Forex by more than 19%. We are holding our EPS call for the year despite these gains, since Cocoa will become a more material headwind in the second half. We continue to demonstrate strong free cash flow and capital deployment, as you can see on our Slide 18. We delivered $1.5 billion of free cash flow in half one. We have repurchased $1.1 billion in stock through half one and will remain opportunistic for the remainder of the year. We also announced today that we are raising our dividend by 11%, marking nine consecutive years with a double-digit dividend increase. Before moving to our outlook, let me make a few comments relative to cocoa on Slide 20. As we know, this is a most likely top of mind for our investors. Our teams continue to monitor the market very closely to put ourselves in the best position possible. While we want to protect ourselves, we continue to put flexible structures in place that enable us to participate in potential market price declines versus current historically high prices. In addition, we continue to fine tune our commercial strategies to ensure long-term sustainable growth while managing through near-term challenges. As guiding principles, we will protect critical price points and key thresholds while broadly utilizing RGM and implementing more pricing in the least elastic segments and consumer occasions. Our objective is to limit elasticity and volume losses while protecting our gross profit dollars to the extent possible, as we believe cocoa prices will adjust eventually. We will also implement cost measures to ensure that we protect our bottom line and ability to invest in the category. It remains too early in the year to provide specifics around 2025. However, there are some key elements and points in time to consider. The mid-crop has been good and in line with historical trends. And although early signs around the main crop are encouraging, we should get a much clearer indication in September, which will likely act as the next catalyst for cocoa costs. As we get to our Q3 earning cycles, we expect to be able to share more color around demand, market liquidity, and the range of cost [at wheels] (ph) relative to 2025, as well as EPS. I'll close with our outlook on Slide 21. Our outlook for \u201824 remains unchanged. We continue to expect on-algo delivery for revenue, earnings per share and cash flow. Note that these earnings per share include significantly higher costs related to cocoa for the second half, which is important to factor into half two models. This includes the upper end of our 3% to 5% range for organic net revenue, which considers the impact of completing price negotiations in Europe and plans to drive improvement enough to result in North America. Most of our key assumptions remain consistent with what we shared with you in our last call, with the exception of interest expenses, which is now estimated at $275 million for the full year. With that, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Great. Thanks so much. Good afternoon, everybody. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, Andrew. Andrew Lazar : Hi, there. Maybe to start off, Dirk, last quarter I think you spoke about the need to offer better value to the consumer in parts of the North America segment. In 2Q, volume declines moderated in North America, as did the benefit from pricing. So how do you see the consumer situation in North America currently and do you see the need for a more aggressive price reset? And separately for you, Luca, volume and organic sales growth needs to accelerate sequentially to hit the upper end of the 3% to 5% range for the year in a still challenging environment while unchanged full year EPS guidance despite the 2Q beat implies a deceleration in the back half on EPS. And I was hoping you could bring us through some of the logic behind those dynamics, please. Dirk Van de Put : Okay, I'll start first, Andrew. So as it relates to the consumer in the US, I would say there's sort of three key dynamics to keep in mind. First of all, the category remains soft but it is stabilizing. And I would say that the consumer is experiencing a tension because they see the overall inflationary picture. They see the food prices that have increased, and they have a feeling of less purchasing power. At the same time, particularly as they see grocery prices stabilizing and their wages being up about 4% while grocery prices are up 1%, they're starting to have bigger confidence than the same period last year, although these high prices remain a concern for them. And I would also say the other thing that we see in the category, while it's soft, as I said, the elasticities have stabilized since Q4 \u201823. The second thing about the consumer is that they have changed where they shop. So the biscuit category is seeing the largest growth in chains like Value Club at Walmart, while in grocery we are seeing a share decline. And probably the most important thing we're seeing about the consumer is that the definition of value has changed for many people. Because if you look two, three years back, it was all about the price per pack, or in fact the unit price per cookie, and people were drifting more towards family and party sized pack and that benefited us. Now, particularly lower income consumers, they have moved to a basket size that they can afford and if the biscuit brand that they like can fit in there at the right price point, they will buy it. If not, they will not buy any biscuits. So these days we have to be much more aware at which price point we offer a pack. So what are we going to do? We don't think we need a full price reset. At the moment, our OI, our operating income, and our cash generation is strong. Our focus is largely on improving our sales and our share in a smart way. We have an opportunity to drive more distribution and displays. And so we need to keep on driving those two, particularly also featured displays. We are implementing new targeted promotions that are probably going to offer a little bit more price on brands like Chips Ahoy!, which is probably most affected by the -- sort of the hesitation from the lower income consumers. And then we will also launch a whole range of new smaller packs that will offer the consumer an opportunity to buy around $3 to $4 for the pack. And so we think that also will make a difference. So more promotions, smaller packs that we will offer, driving distribution, those are the solutions that we are planning for. We're already seeing benefits. Chips Ahoy! is recuperating quite nicely. Oreo and Ritz are increasing their market share. And on top of all that, we will have some very impactful activations. So we talked about Star Wars in the call here. There's another big one coming up, which I cannot yet announce, but we have some very strong activations on Oreo in the second half. All that together gives us the confidence that we will see a good second half in North America. Luca? Luca Zaramella : So, for the first half, we are broadly where we would have expected to be, quite honestly. Revenue might be a little bit softer, but strong profit will allow us to reinvest into some selective additional activities in half two to deliver profitable volume growth. I think you rightly pointed out the implied top line growth for half two which current guidance requires an acceleration. And that hinges on three main drivers. The number one driver that will impact the most is Europe that will have to return to volume growth. With disruption behind us, we feel quite good about achieving that. The team in Europe has proven consistently that they can execute very well and plans are in place to activate around big key consumers' activities like back to school and Christmas. It is also important to remind ourselves that the trade stock pipeline is an opportunity in Europe as we had to pull back on shipments and so the piping the trade is a material opportunity and something that we are clearly already seeing in July. The second element is the US biscuit positive volume. I have to say the diagnostics around what is happening to the overall category and the share pressure that we see are clearly giving us an indication of what has to change. And we truly believe that hitting those price points is going to result in positive outcomes. And again, we start seeing some green shots in the category and in our brands. The third element is that while I do not like to talk much about lapping, last year for the second part of the year, we discontinued some product lines that were material in volume for the give and go business. And I think from now we will be comparing more to a clean base. And so I think that's the third element to bear in mind. I think all in all we have at this point, line of sight to the upper end of our revenue guidance for the year. As far as EPS goes, importantly, we have landed the price in line with our expectations. There might be more selective price that we will be doing in light of height and cocoa, but no major deviations are expected on this front. Our commodity cost for the year is almost 100% locked, so no surprises expected on that front either. As I mentioned a few times, just bear in mind that we bought cocoa quite well for this year and that year-to-date cocoa costs are meaningfully better than the 2024 average. So there is more cost coming in the second half [although] (ph) the EPS guidance being kept in line despite the very strong results here today. We will continue to invest in working media in line with the first part of the year, but we will also start optimizing as we discussed a few times the non-working media which is still an opportunity in this outlook. And finally, we will continue to pursue cost measures and productivity. So all in all, we believe reaffirming guidance is the right thing to do. And again, July is shaping up quite well for us at this point in time. But obviously, as I said, there is more work to do, particularly around the US consumption side. Andrew Lazar : Thanks so much. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Andrew. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Ken Goldman : Hi, thank you. Dirk, I wanted to\u2026 Dirk Van de Put : Hi, Ken. Ken Goldman : Hi guys. I wanted to clarify a little bit about Europe. You talked about how completing your pricing actions helps position you well in terms of volume growth for the second half. I think you also mentioned that Europe elasticities, those still modest, are moving slightly higher. Excuse me. So I'm just curious if maybe we can elaborate a little bit on what drives your confidence in volume growth just given some of the pricing actions, what seemed to be tougher comparisons and that slightly higher elasticity that you mentioned, if I'm correct on all of those? Dirk Van de Put : Yes, yes. Well, first of all, the consumer, I would say, is cautiously optimistic. I would say in general we feel that the European consumer seems to be in a better place than the North American consumer. They see their incomes rise, the inflation is softening, they see quite stable employment, particularly in the UK is important for us in Europe and there the confidence which was relatively low last year is rising because they feel that their broader economy is doing better and they feel better about their personal finances. And then I would say France and Germany, the other two big countries, we have some mixed views across the economic indicators, but the confidence is also above last year. So, second thing is, yes, there is an uptick in elasticities and there is also more promotions, but I would say the elasticities remain quite modest. And there is a little bit of an increase in promo intensity. We are also seeing the same shift of people buying -- going from hypers and supers to discounters and then we see also these affordable packs at the right price point. So, similar movement as I was talking about in North America. If you look at Q2, our biscuits and baked snacks are already positive in Europe. They're growing their value at 2.8% and volume at 0.8%. In chocolate, we see a strong momentum with seasonal shapes. We also see tablets, bars, and pralines doing well. Back to school and Christmas, of course, in chocolate will be very important. We are continuing to watch the pricing impact. Overall, I would say if you exclude some of the disruption that we saw, the performance in Europe is quite solid. And since that disruption, the pricing has been implemented now, we feel that that solid underlying growth that we see there is going to continue in the second half. So we're expecting quite a good second half. I would also like to mention here that chocolate, despite already seeing quite a bit of prices, remains quite resilient. There's more to come. I've seen the cocoa situation. But overall, volume has been quite solid. We're also planning to continue to invest strongly. Our Easter was very strong, so we have high expectations for back to school and Christmas. And so overall, I would say that I would be surprised if the second half is not a good half for Europe. Ken Goldman : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Alexia Howard of Bernstein. Alexia Howard : Good evening, everyone. Dirk Van de Put : Hi, Alexia. Luca Zaramella : Hi. Alexia Howard : Hi there, So just a couple of quick ones. On the ERP transition, is that something that's going to be rolled out across different regions or is it something that's going to affect particular categories at a particular point? Should we be worried about the impact of that transition for 2025? Luca Zaramella : So it is a program that will be completed over a four-year time frame. And the reason why that is, is a couple of things. One is we will use a staggered approach and we will be able to implement it in part of the business first and rolling off resources eventually from that part of the business and rolling on those resources into the next wave of countries that will be impacted. We will also make a big distinction between some modules of SAP versus others, so we will not necessarily take even by region a big bank approach. And we believe that the preparation we have been doing for the last, I would say, 18 months positions as well in terms of successful execution. So we have tried to minimize all potential issues by going broad in one region or by going broad in the world of SAP. And we believe, given also the resources we have internally, and importantly, the ones we have secure through SAP and Accenture, that we will have a good opportunity to execute as well. Alexia Howard : Great. And then as a follow-up, I'm just curious about the long-term free cash flow guidance. It's been sitting, I think, at this $3 billion level for some time, even as your earnings growth has obviously played out quite nicely in recent years. You've obviously got guidance of $3.5 billion this year. What are the puts and takes or what are the criteria that you would use when you're thinking about whether that guidance of free cash flow could be raised at some point down the road? Luca Zaramella : The answer is yes. We will have a couple of one-timers in the second part of the year and that is really what drives the $3.5 billion. But both last year where we had to pay some taxes related to coffee, and this year where we have a potential one-timer that we will be paying most likely off in August, I would say, if you strip those out that are clearly one-time impacts, I mean, our cash flow is running at $4 billion plus. So we feel quite good about it. Cash conversion cycle continues to be top notch. We continue to improve days outstanding and one of the reasons why we believe SAP and o9, which is the other platform around supply and demand planning that we are implementing with this ERP program is going to be beneficial to us is around inventory, which is an area that has material opportunities in it. So the answer is certainly we can strive for more than $4 billion on an ongoing basis. Alexia Howard : Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Alexia. Operator : We'll take our next question from Michael Lavery of Piper Sandler. Michael Lavery : Thank you. Good evening. I just wanted to come back to cocoa for a second. That slide you laid out is really helpful at the end of the presentation. I was wondering if you could give us a sense of how much you might be placing a bet on prices rolling over in September. Put a little differently, have you been securing for \u201825 kind of as normal, which I would roughly maybe put you at about half or a little bit more covered at this time of year? Or are you trying to position for a move that you see it sounds like you might expect to come a little bit later in the year? Luca Zaramella : Yes, look, we believe there is going to be a correction. I mean even today if you take the stock price of today which is around about GBP6,500 per ton, and compare it to next year Q4, there is a gap of GBP2,200, which is clearly material. So the market, in light of the mid-crop, and importantly of the evolution of the main crop sees a clear adjustment of prices going forward. And I think there might be even more than this. Obviously, we are not going to go blind into 2025. We cannot wait and bet on the main crop to be good. And we have been certainly improving and increasing our physical coverage into 2025. We have around about one quarter of our positions into 2025 covered to futures. And you might imagine we have covered outer in the year to take advantage of this inverted curve, which means how big of a discount you get, the further you go out versus today's fault. The rest is covered through a series of derivatives that allow us to participate in a potential market correction. So at this point in time, whichever way you look at it, we have protection for the most part of our positions into 2025. And on the other side, we have secured also some physical forward positions that I believe will position as well compared to the market eventual cocoa price adjustments that might happen or not. Michael Lavery : Okay, that's very helpful. And just following up on BISCOFF, it sounds like a very interesting partnership. Can you give a little better sense of maybe the structure? It sounds like it's not a JV, perhaps it's cross-licensing, maybe a little bit of just how it works, and then also kind of what its potential could be. Obviously at the moment it's initially going to be Europe and India, but could it go global? Are there reasons that it's got any geographic limitations? Dirk Van de Put : Yes. So there's three main components to the partnership. The first one is that we're going to co-brand chocolate products with BISCOFF. And BISCOFF is not yet a very big brand in North America, but it's quite a big brand in Europe. It's one of the biggest biscuits brands, and it has a quite unique taste and also quite unique consumption moment. And the combination of a chocolate bar with BISCOFF filling or with pieces of BISCOFF in there is quite delicious. So that's the first one. To give you an idea, we already have a similar line which uses Oreo as the filling and we are talking about several hundred millions of sales in Europe for that line. So we have the same expectations for the BISCOFF line. And if that is a success in Europe, we will obviously want to extend that around the world into our other chocolate brands. And the first launch of this product will be in early 2025. And that will help us with excitement, building excitement around the chocolate market. Then secondly, BISCOFF is looking for global distribution, and there's certain countries where that is not easy to get. So we will manufacture, distribute and sell BISCOFF in India as a first country. It's going to start in the second half of 2025. It's very interesting for us because at the moment our biscuit business in India is really built around Oreo and this is going to give us a second big brand, very different from Oreo, very different audience, very different consumption moment, largely with coffee or tea in India. And so we think it's going to be an ideal complement to keep on building a strong biscuits business in India. And that clearly is a test to see if we would do other countries around the world. And so yeah, it's not a joint venture, it's a cross sort of licensing of our brands to each other. Michael Lavery : Okay, that's really helpful. [indiscernible] Delta and people go crazy for them on there. So you've probably got at least a better head start in the US than you may know. But, I\u2019ll pass it on. Dirk Van de Put : Thank you, Okay. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll move next to Tom Palmer of Citi. Your line is open. Tom Palmer : Hi, thanks for the question. Dirk Van de Put : Hi. Tom Palmer : I think a quarter ago, you talked about volume being a flattish year-over-year in 2024. I just wanted to confirm, is this still the expectation? And then any help as to how much maybe some of the more non-recurring items like the disruptions in Europe or the subsidy timing in Mexico might have weighed on volumes in the second quarter because so we could think about kind of an entry run rate at least for the third quarter? Luca Zaramella : Yes. I think the expectation it is still around having a sort of flattish volume mix for the year and in terms of one-timers as I said, there is 1.3 points of expected -- of disruption that happened in Q2. The whole 4 points of volume mix in Europe are attributable to the consumer -- or the customer disruption, sorry. There is another component which is about the Middle East conflict that impacted on about 3 percentage points for the quarter. The other one, as I said, that you need to bear in mind, is the impact of give and go and this continuation that we had in Q4 last year. But also importantly, last year we had a carryover of the first half disruption in Europe into half two. And that was around about $100 million of revenue impact. So when you strip out all these impacts, you clearly see a much better linearity of the volume mix and revenue. And when you come to terms that the actions that the US is taking around consumers and packs, I think we have clearly an expectation that these improve volume mix in the second half and improve revenue in the second half. Tom Palmer : Okay, thanks for that detail. And just on the A&C side, I know you talked about some meaningful step-ups here in the first half of the year. I think if we look at the timing of some of the step-ups last year, it was maybe a little bit second half weighted at least in terms of the dollar spend. Does that become maybe less of a headwind in terms of the year-over-year pressure as we think about the back half of the year in terms of the flow through to earnings? Luca Zaramella : There might be a little bit of an upside in relation to the fact that, as we mentioned, we are taking a deeper look at all the non-working media part of A&C. I don't expect it to be material for the second part of the year. And importantly, we will continue still investing in our working media. So I don't expect a material upside in terms of P&L impact due to lower A&C in the second part of the year. Tom Palmer : All right. Thank you. Luca Zaramella : You're welcome. Operator : We'll take our next question from Peter Galbo of Bank of America. Peter Galbo : Hey, Dirk, Luca. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Luca Zaramella : Hi, Peter. Peter Galbo : Hi. Luca, I was just wondering if you could maybe unpack the Mexico comments a bit more. I think we've heard kind of different things from different companies this quarter related to Mexico. Some have mentioned the subsidy timing that you called out. Others have seen maybe more of a normalization after such a strong kind of several years in Mexico. So just curious, A, if maybe there's a bit of both going on there at this point, or if truly you think that the subsidy piece was a blip and you've already seen a re-acceleration into July? Thanks very much. Dirk Van de Put : Yes, I mean, overall the market conditions in Mexico for us are healthy. For instance, the biscuits and the chocolate category both saw mid-single-digit increase in value. Gum and meals also performed quite well. I would say the economy is doing well. There is good employment. There was a lower flow because of the elections of public subsidies to the households that we think will start to normalize in H2. But in general, if you look at minimum wage has doubled in the last years in Mexico. So the overall climate is very positive as it relates to the consumer. If you look at the low single-digit Q2 growth that we had, that largely came from our candy and our chocolate business, which was offset by growth in gum and meals. And particularly in candy, we think that there probably our price points are a little bit too high. We will need to work on those. In chocolate, a little bit the same. And we need to make sure that we're well positioned for the Christmas season there. Again, gum and meals are doing very well, and also the biscuit growth for us was quite strong. The Oreo distribution, which is critical because of the Ricolino partnership that we have, is growing well, and Oreo is growing also in single digits in Mexico. So I would say the, I think that this effect of the subsidy certainly affected candy and chocolate. Overall, we remain quite positive. We think there will be a gradual recovery in H2. The long-term opportunity for growth remains quite significant. The integration with Ricolino is going well, and their route to market will enable us our ambition to grow market share, particularly for biscuits and chocolates. There's also a US business related to Ricolino, which of course is not the subject of the question, but that one also is important because it positions Ricolino as the leader of the Hispanic US candy market. But overall I would say I think it's a temporary issue driven by these subsidies. And in the second half I'm expecting to see a good recuperation in Mexico. Peter Galbo : Great. Thanks, Dirk. That's helpful. And Luca, just maybe a quick one. We've had some questions come in. Obviously the kind of over-delivery on gross margin in the first half and I think that there was an expectation kind of coming out of the fourth quarter of this year that you'd be down -- gross margins kind of basis or more than basis points, actual points on a year-over-year basis as we exit \u201824 and just wanted to see if that's kind of still the expectation given the cocoa inflation in 2H. Thanks very much. Luca Zaramella : Yes, I think, look, we moved away from giving guidance in terms of gross margin percentage. What I will tell you is we are going to have a year that is ahead in terms of gross profit dollar growth delivery compared to our usual algorithm. I think in the end, what will really matter is the amount of pricing we would have implemented and how much pricing we're going to take into next year in light of whatever cocoa is going to be come the end of 2024. So we are very happy. I have to be honest with the level of profitability we have achieved in the first part of the year. There, would have suggested, I believe, under normal circumstances that we have upside to the guidance we gave you. But reality is cocoa is a material headwind in the second part of the year. And the reality is we might have to selectively invest in some of the activities that you have been hearing throughout the call. It is not a massive investment. It doesn't take away that in terms of profitability and ability to reinvest in A&C, we have done, I believe, a very good job but we prefer maybe to be cautious around the level of profit going forward because again cocoa prices as we have secured them in the first part of the year are clearly much lower than the current spot price and 2025 price for cocoa would suggest. Peter Galbo : Great. Thanks, guys. Luca Zaramella : Thank you. Operator : We'll take a question from Matt Smith, Stifel. Matt Smith : Hi. Good afternoon. Just a quick... Dirk Van de Put : Hi. Matt Smith : I wanted to ask a question about the performance in India. You mentioned volumes are relatively flat in the market this quarter with a bit of a step-up in elasticity. Can you talk about how you're approaching distribution point opportunities in this type of consumer environment? You continue to see good progress on expanding your distribution in the market. Dirk Van de Put : Yes, yes. So in India, if I give you a little bit of a background, so we're looking at flat growth in Q2, mid-single-digit in H1. Chocolate growth is continuing well, a high single-digit, good gross margin improvement. Cadbury Dairy Milk continues to be a strong leader of the market despite the fact that we've already implemented some pricing. It's mainly in biscuits where India is being affected. So we have seen a consumption dip because there is more intense competition and consumers are clearly moving to lower price points. And our biscuit business is largely built around Oreo, which I would call a more premium biscuit in the Indian market. If I look at the stores, so since 2019, we've deployed more than 700,000 visi coolers. In 2023, we added 180,000 stores to our coverage and about 100,000 new visi coolers. In H1 in \u201824, we've already added another 140,000 stores and 90,000 visi coolers. So that's a very strong performance compared to \u201823. Still, if you take into account, there's 9 million food retail outlets. We now cover about 2.3 million directly and just over 3 million if we take our indirect coverage. So we still have a huge headroom. So I would say, yes, there is a bit of a slowdown after three years of inflation. A group of the consumers, particularly in biscuits, is a bit more careful in their consumption, but we don't see that as something that would slow down our focus on expanding our distribution. In India, we're going to continue to work as we've been working in the previous years, placing those visi coolers, driving our distribution, because we are very confident that gradually the consumer will start to buy Oreo again. And our chocolate business, as I mentioned, keeps on doing very well. Matt Smith : Thank you, Dirk. I'll leave it there and pass it on. Operator : This does conclude our question-and-answer session. I'm happy to return the call to Dirk Van de Put for any closing comments. Dirk Van de Put : Well, I thank everybody for their attendance to the call. I would call it again a solid second quarter, and our expectations are for an improved H2 and looking forward to see you at the end of Q3. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, everyone. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect your lines. And everyone, have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Mondelez International Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Mondelez Management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondelez. Please go ahead, sir. Shep Dunlap : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO; and Luca Zaramella, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. As we discuss our results today, unless noted as reported, we'll be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures, which adjust for certain items included in our GAAP results. In addition, we provide year-over-year growth on a constant-currency basis, unless otherwise noted. You can find the comparable GAAP measures and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation. Today, Dirk will provide a business strategy update followed by a review of our financial results and outlook by Luca. We will close with Q&A. I'll now turn the call over to Dirk. Dirk Van de Put : Thanks, Shep, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. I will start on Slide 4. I'm pleased to share that we delivered strong top line growth with positive volume mix. Developed markets grew mid-single-digits, led by solid progress in North America biscuits as well as recovery in Europe following successful implementation of our annual pricing. Emerging markets also grew mid-single-digits, despite continued boycotts of Western brands in certain markets. Strong profit dollar growth enabled us to continue our track record of robust free cash flow generating $2.5 billion year-to-date. We expanded our presence in the fast growing cakes and pastries category by acquiring a majority stake in Evirth, a leading player in cakes and pastries in China. And I'll provide some additional color on this exciting partnership in a few minutes. We remain diligent in driving progress against our long-term growth strategy, focused on our core categories of chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks. These core categories continue to show strong consumption, and on top, consumers remain very favorable to our iconic portfolio, as such generating significant headroom opportunities. These strong fundamentals, combined with our advantaged geographic footprint, keep on giving us confidence that we are well positioned to compound long-term sustainable growth. Turning to Slide 5, you can see that organic net revenue grew 5.4% this quarter, with adjusted gross profit dollar growth of 11.2%, enabling us to continue investing in the business. A&C spending is up mid-single-digits, helping to drive continuing consumer and customer loyalty to both our iconic global brands and our local jewels. And adjusted EPS grew 28.6% this quarter, and we have generated $2.5 billion in free cash flow through the first nine months of the year. On Slide 6, we are pleased to see that developed markets are beginning to recover with solid revenue growth and an increasing healthy volume mix in the third quarter. Unlike many of our peers, we are seeing continued consumer uptake of our core snacking categories. In North America, we are seeing volume growth start to rebound as inflation cools and we continue to expand distribution in areas like club. Similarly, in Europe, revenue grew 8.1% in the third quarter, following significant disruption earlier in the year, as our annual pricing took hold. Unlike many of our peers, both volume mix and net revenue are beginning to turn the corner. Consumers are continuing to embrace chocolate and biscuits as everyday indulgences, And our revenue growth management strategies enable us to meet every consumer's needs, with a broad array of product formats, pack sizes and price points to meet their definition of value. Turning to Slide 7, you can see a bit more context on how and why our snacking categories remain durable. In North America, consumer confidence remains stable, despite continuing concern with overall grocery prices. Biscuit category volume is improving to flat to slightly up over the last three months. In the United States, private label volume share is declining, demonstrating that consumers remain loyal to their favorite brands and that our price pack architecture is working. As a result, our two largest US brands, Oreo and Ritz, are gaining share year-to-date. Meanwhile, in Europe, elasticities are moving slightly higher, but remain modest. We continue to see solid category value growth in both biscuits and chocolate, with private label share declining over the past three months. Some consumers are shifting to smaller packs of chocolate for everyday snacking, and again, our RGM and price pack architecture enable us to offer an appropriate range of choices. As we head into the year-end festive season, seasonals are also looking solid. In emerging markets, modest elasticities continue. Consumer confidence is stable in India, Brazil and Mexico. While the overall China economy remains challenged, we're seeing optimism beginning to return as stimulus policies take effect. Overall, our combined emerging markets value and volume share is improving in both biscuits and chocolates. Turning to Slide 8, it's important to reinforce that while the external environment remains volatile, we remain focused on accelerating our long term growth strategy. We're continuing to reinvest in our brands, expand distribution, drive M&A and scale sustainable snacking. We remain on track to deliver 90% of revenue through our core categories of chocolate, biscuit and baked snacks by 2030. And our teams continue to deliver strong progress against our strategic agenda. For example, our Oreo brand launched in August an innovative collaboration with Coca-Cola, our largest global brand activation to date. These two iconic brands joined forces in a 360 degree marketing campaign, encompassing digital, social, celebrity and in-person activation to unite our strong fan bases and build buzz around two high profile limited editions, a Coke flavored Oreo cookie and an Oreo flavored Zero Sugar Coke. These types of investments not only enable us to stay top of mind for consumers, but also to strengthen partnerships with key retailers. Along with these marketing activations, we are continuing to strengthen store availability, visibility and execution around the world. For example, in Brazil, the convenience channel is growing high single-digit on a year-to-date basis, with plans to further grow coverage in this channel with additional stores. We are also continuing to harness the power of acquisition to capture synergies and drive growth. For example, in China, our acquisition of Evirth step changes our growth in the cakes and pastries category. I'll provide additional color in just a minute. Importantly, we remain committed to driving progress towards a more sustainable snacking business through our continued focus on our environmental and social sustainability agenda. For example, we recently introduced new recyclable paper packaging for our legendary LU biscuit brand in France, Belgium and the United Kingdom. Now let's dig a little deeper into the cakes and pastries category and our recent announcement in China. As you can see on Slide 9, the global packaged cakes and pastries category is valued at about $95 billion. Mondelez currently holds the number three global share position. And because this category is highly fragmented around the world, we see significant opportunities for bolt-on M&A as well as organic growth. We already have delivered strong growth in this category through our 2020 acquisition of Give & Go, the leading manufacturer of frozen to fresh brownies, cookies, cupcakes and related bakery products in North America. And our 2022 acquisition of Chipita, a leader in croissants, baked rolls and related snacks, anchored in Central and Eastern Europe. In China, as you can see on the right hand side of the slide, the packaged cakes and pastries category is valued at about $14 billion. Within that category, the frozen-to-chilled segment is growing double digits, currently estimated at $1.5 billion. Chinese consumers increasingly seek fresh premium options with innovative and sophisticated taste profiles to meet a growing range of snacking occasions. On Slide 10, you can see that's why we are excited about the expansion of our existing partnership with Evirth, the Chinese leader in the fast growing frozen-to-chilled baked snacks category. We have worked with Evirth for several years to develop, manufacture, market and sell cakes Several years to develop, manufacture, market and sell cakes and pastries, featuring some of our iconic brands, including Oreo and Philadelphia. Our recent purchase of a majority stake will enable us to further accelerate growth through continuous innovation, leveraging the combination of our high value brand with Evirth\u2019s advanced R&D and technical expertise. Chinese consumers increasingly are seeking fresh premium products, with demand growing especially fast among younger generations in mid-tier cities. Evirth has a strong presence among key customers, including club stores, and our expanded partnership will enable us to scale distribution broader and faster. Before I turn the microphone over to Luca, I'd like to share some preliminary perspective on our approach to 2025, in light of the widely known cocoa cost headwind. Chocolate remains a great category and continues to generate significant consumer interest. Consumers count on our iconic brands, including Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka, Toblerone, Cote D'or, Marabou, Freia, Lacta to celebrate special occasions, to share with family and friends and to unwind with the moment of mindful indulgence. As we will continue to invest in our brands, we remain confident that consumer loyalty will not only endure, but continue to grow, even as we execute the necessary short-term pricing steps. Our primary focus is to continue to build the health and the growth of the chocolate category as a whole and our brands in particular. While we remain relentlessly obsessed with consumer value, we do anticipate some upticks in elasticity in certain markets, and we might need to adapt to more aggressive RGM and promotions. And while the temporary cost increase of Cocoa will put pressure on our margins, we will continue to invest in tools that strengthen brand loyalty and accelerate growth, such as visi coolers to improve visibility and accessibility, as well as continued strong investments in working media. We expect the majority of our portfolio to grow both top and bottom line, consistent with our algorithm, and we believe we are taking the right steps to position the chocolate business for attractive and long-term sustainable growth. We remain confident that we are well equipped to appropriately manage input cost headwinds and to emerge stronger. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca to share additional insights on our financials. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Dirk, and good afternoon everyone. Q3 was a strong quarter across our key financial metrics, including top line, gross profit dollar, A&C investments, earnings growth and free cash flow. Revenue grew 5.4% with strong pricing execution and positive volume/mix growth. Developed markets grew 5.6% with a volume/mix increase of 1% driven by both North America and Europe. Total revenue for emerging markets grew 4.9% with a volume/mix decline of 1%, driven by Western brand boycotts in EMEA and the lower volumes mostly in Mexico. Moving to portfolio performance on Slide 14. Biscuits and baked snacks grew 3.3% for the quarter. Several brands delivered robust growth including Oreo, Ritz, belVita, LU, 7 Days and Club Social. US biscuits delivered solid growth in the quarter with a good balance from both pricing and volume/mix. Chocolate grew plus 9.2% with strength in both developed and emerging markets. Volume/mix was down minus 1.2%, driven mostly by challenges in Latin America whereas most of Europe came back strongly after customer disruption. Cadbury Dairy Milk, Milka, Toblerone and Freia Marabou all delivered strong growth for the quarter. Gum and candy grew 5.6%, driven by continued momentum and strength in key markets, including Brazil and US candy. Volume/mix in this category was slightly positive. Let's review market and share performance on slide 15. We held or gained share in 35% of our revenue base with solid results in chocolate as well as in gum and candy. This strength was partially offset by our US biscuits business, which accounts for approximately 25 percentage points of revenue. We expect total share metric to improve moving forward as Europe gained share in Q3 following customer disruption in F1. The US still has work to do, but we have seen shareholding in the last three months and believe new price packs in Q4 should help drive further improvements. Moving to regional performance on Slide 16. Europe grew 8.1% in Q3. Execution was strong in key markets such as the UK, Germany and France, all delivering significant growth. We saw a slight uptick in elasticity resulting from pricing, but consumer sentiment remains relatively stable. OI dollars were up more than 46%, including significant A&C investments and due in part to pricing versus favorable cocoa phasing. North America grew 3.7% against a strong compare of nearly 10% in the prior year. Solid performance in growth channels, distribution gains and impactful brand activations like the Oreo Coca-Cola partnership drove Q3 growth. New price pack for Oreo, Ritz and Chips Ahoy! that will provide better representation in the $3 to $4 range are just beginning to hit retail shelves now. North America OI increased 6.5%. AMEA grew 5.8%. China posted strong results with high single-digit growth fueled by continued investments in brand building across Oreo, Chips Ahoy!, and Stride, coupled with ongoing distribution gains, adding approximately 80,000 new outlets on a year-to-date basis. India was down slightly in Q3, driven by a decline in biscuits, where inflation has led to a more competitive promotional environment. On the flip side, chocolate continues to perform well, especially within the low unit price segment, which grew mid-single-digits. Australia, New Zealand and Japan delivered another strong quarter of growth driven by RGM, strong activations and innovation. Boycotts in the Middle East and Southeast Asia remain a headwind to results. We expect this dynamic to persist for the foreseeable future. However, it is largely embedded in the base beginning Q4. The overall impact to the region was approximately 2 percentage points worth of growth. AMEA increased OI dollars by more than 15% with meaningful A&C increases. Latin America grew 2% in the quarter. Brazil and Western Andean posted growth, while Mexico was down modestly. Note that Argentina pricing has been capped at 26% unlike Q3 last year, where the country contributed more than 18 points to LA growth. Latin America OI declined 4.8%, due primarily to lower volumes in Argentina and Mexico. Turning to Page 17. In Q3, we saw strong double-digit gross profit dollar NOI dollar growth. Top line growth, pricing execution and ongoing cost discipline helped fuel these results. In addition, cocoa is still relatively benign in Q3, thanks to our effective coverage strategies. In Q4, this dynamic will reverse with meaningful pressure to profit as Cocoa catches up to market levels. Next to EPS on Slide 18. Q3 EPS grew more than 28% in constant currency on the same drivers as OI. We continue to generate strong free cash flow as you can see on Slide 19. We delivered $2.5 billion to date, which includes a payment of nearly $400 million in the quarter related to the EU Commission matter. We have repurchased $1.2 billion in stock year-to-date and will continue to be opportunistic for the remainder of the year and into 2025. Before moving to our outlook, I'll provide some additional context on cocoa. Cocoa costs have decreased since all-time highs, and futures signal eventual normalization, albeit the market is still showing signs of nervousness due to tight physical availability ahead of the new crop. At this stage, the new crop outlook remains positive with significant recovery compared to last year. Both consensus and our internal outlook forecast a surplus and increased stocks into 2025. With still a few weeks to go before pods are harvested, we believe this is good news. We also continue to employ a flexible hedging structure that would allow us to risk manage next year. Moving to Slide 22 and our approach to pricing and cost as we move into 2025. In terms of pricing, we will continue to utilize all the tools in our RGM playbook to minimize volume declines and limit elasticities, thus protecting penetration and frequency of consumption. We will keep price points especially for entry level and low unit items. We will also improve our participation at multiple price levels, offering consumers more choices. Additionally, we will continue to reinvest in our brands, primarily through working media. Cost management is another area of focus. We plan to take a targeted approach to managing costs by focusing on non-working media, overheads and productivity. We will not take shortcuts or make temporary moves that disturb the business, but rather focus on areas where we can make lasting changes. We will also not sacrifice key investments or product quality. Net, we are confident that we have a strong plan to navigate the headwinds presented by cocoa next year. We will focus on what we can control and will remain agile as needed to ensure the long term health of this category while positioning ourselves to emerge stronger when cocoa prices settle at more sustainable levels. Turning to our outlook. Our outlook for 2024 remains unchanged. We continue to expect on algo delivery for revenue, earnings per share, growth and cash flow. Just a word on EPS. We continue to expect high single-digit growth off a 2023 base that includes developed market gum. When you look at year-to-date margins, two things are clear aside from strong operating performance. First, we procure cocoa at much better prices than the market. And second, we priced a replacement cost. Thus, profit growth has been quite good. On the other side, Q4 is a bit of an anomaly as we booked your cocoa for Q4 close to peak, if not at peak prices, while at the same time, we will not yet have the benefits of either additional pricing or planned cocoa savings initiatives in Q4. While next year cocoa will be significantly higher than the average of 2024, it is projected to be lower than Q4 2024. Most of our other key assumptions remain consistent with what we shared with you on our last call, with the exception of interest expenses, which is now estimated at $250 million for the year. Although it is premature to get into specifics around our \u201825 outlook, I would note a couple of items. The majority of our business, which is not chocolate, will be on algorithm. We expect peak cocoa pricing to be reflected in the first half of 2025 while chocolate margins should improve sequentially versus Q4 2024. Our plans around pricing, RGM and cost management are expected to be significant and help provide room for reinvestment. However, where we sit today, it is tough to see a path to earning growth in 2025 unless cocoa is just down from the current future curve and/or elasticities are much more benign than our current planning assumptions, [ergo] (ph) there will be additional pricing. But as we said a few times, we believe cocoa in 2026 is going to normalize and we would have a meaningful rebound of our chocolate profit to allow for us to get back on track with our algorithm. Clearly, we do not control cocoa prices. But in the unlikely event that they would not normalize by 2026, our gradual approach to pricing seems still to be the best approach to take. Overall, we feel good about the fundamentals of the business, our growth opportunities, the investments we are continuing to make in the business and our plans to navigate this short term cocoa dynamic. We expect to emerge from this period of elevated cocoa prices even stronger and better positioned for attractive sustainable earnings growth. We will provide more details related to 2025 at our year-end call. Finally, a word on our sales of the JDE Peet's shares. We are happy overall with the return we realized on our coffee financial investments. Some of the proceeds will be deployed immediately towards lowering our CPE balance, but eventually will be deployed towards buyback and to support M&A. There will be a modest dilution in Q4 with a full year $0.08 headwind. We will issue an 8-K with more details over the coming weeks. With that, let's open the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go to our first question from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Thanks so much. Good evening. Maybe, Dirk, first, I was hoping you could discuss the puts and takes in 3Q and maybe specifically how that shapes sort of your strategy in chocolate going forward in light of the challenges that cocoa is going to present next year? Dirk Van de Put : Yes. Hello, Andrew. Well, overall, I would say we feel good about Q3, the results, and also the dynamics that we see in there. So as you could see, we have a strong top line growth. We have positive volume mix. And the consumer, I would say, in most places is holding up well. Developed markets came back with solid balanced growth in North America and also Europe strengthening again. And the emerging markets remain solid. There's a few pockets of softness there, but we have clear plans to address that. We continue to invest in working media and our brands. We -- and our bottom line was very strong with good free cash flow results. So we can't complain, I would say, about our quarter. And I think the feeling that the top line will continue to be robust into next year is certainly there, because we feel that overall the business is quite healthy and we have very good activities planned for next year. Yeah, chocolate is a challenge, but we are quite clear on which principles we have and what vision we have to deal with the cocoa challenge. Our first focus is to protect the health of the chocolate category, which is a great category. Our second one is, of course, within that category to hold or gain market share and taking an overall long term approach to how the category will develop and how our business will develop. We have to price next year, but we are very conscious of making sure that we protect key price points and certain thresholds. So we're doing a lot of work on our low unit pricing in emerging markets or entry level pricing in developed markets. And we're launching a bunch of new sizes in our chocolate business. I think our RGM plans are well thought through. We just went through everything with all the different business units that we have, and I think the work that has been done is very strong. And we've really thought through how we think the category will evolve in the coming months. We are planning to continue to invest in our brands, but we did look at all the non-working media and are aiming for some significant efficiencies there. And then, of course, we will also work on our other costs, particularly overhead costs next year, so that we can deliver what I would call a reasonable financial result overall. The rest of our business is business as usual. Maybe a few more things in the sense that we are not taking any shortcuts for short-term gains next year. We do realize that there is additional pricing and we will have some extra pressure. But overall, as I said before, we think chocolate is an outstanding category and we are fully committed to it. And the other maybe thing is, things can go different as it relates to reaction to pricing. We have assumed normal elasticity, but that could be more or less or cocoa pricing is still very volatile. It could be more or less than we planned. So being agile next year in how we deal with those situations will be another critical thing for us, I believe. I hope that helps. Andrew Lazar : Thank you. Yeah, very helpful. I appreciate that. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up, Luca, I realize obviously you're not prepared to provide detailed 25% guidance yet. But fourth quarter, as you mentioned, it's the first one where you'll see the impact of significantly higher cocoa costs. So I guess how does this 4Q implied guidance, which looks for EPS, I think, down some 20% or so year-over-year inform the way we should think about next year? Whatever else you can share along those lines knowing you're not going to provide the full thing yet? Thank you. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Andrew. I mean, I will start by saying that we are clearly very happy with EPS on a year-to-date basis and that I think will help us understanding a little bit better Q4 next year. We have landed today all pricing in line with our expectations and we are in general priced to a level that is higher than our actual cost of cocoa for the first three quarters as our cocoa buying strategies have been clearly quite advantageous compared to in-market costs. As you rightly point out, the implied EPS for Q4 based on us reaffirming guidance is down year-on-year. But I said in the prepared remarks that I see that as a sort of anomaly. First of all, because cocoa costs for Q4 were locked in when cocoa was at peak value. And second, clearly in the numbers in Q4, there is no effect of additional pricing or for that matter of the cost measures that we will put in place as of the beginning of 2025. Bear in mind that in 2025, pricing will not flow through as of day one. And so it will take a little bit of time for profit to improve and quite frankly profit improvement is more towards the second half of the year. Please also consider as we talk about 2025 that cocoa costs are lower in the second half versus half one. On \u201825, I can tell you that we have done a lot of work in scrutinizing all our costs and we will be removing sizable costs, particularly in the area of overhead and non-productive media expenses. We have increased the amount of productivities that we'll be delivering to our supply chain and we've had clearly a full slate of initiatives in our GM that should limit elasticities. As I said, it is hard to see a path to EPS growth into 2025 unless cocoa adjusts now materially and that is still a possibility and/or elasticities are more benign, allowing us to price more. We have seen as of late following the price increases we put in place in Europe, for instance, that elasticities have been fairly benign. So if we realize that volume is there, we might push price a little bit more forward to in an attempt to offset the cocoa impact that we will have inevitably next year. Operator : We'll move next to Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Ken Goldman : Hi, thank you. Good afternoon. I had one question on North America and then a follow-up. On North America, the comment was made that your categories are sort of bucking the, what seems to be a larger, more challenged trend across snacking. And you did mention RGM as being part of it. I appreciate that. Just trying to get a sense what you're seeing as the other factors that is allowing or that are allowing your categories to do better than what we're seeing kind of elsewhere across that broader snacking continuum as someone once said? Dirk Van de Put : Yeah. Ken, the -- I would say the category is growing modestly and is improving slightly. And I would say that, overall, we see the consumer also getting more confident. But high prices remain certainly a big concern, high food prices, I would say. And consumers clearly feel that their purchasing power is deteriorating, particularly, I would say, in the lower income consumers. They're the ones that feel most of the pressure. I would say that as it relates to our categories, first of all, we have recognized that the perception of value of the consumer has changed. If you go two years back, consumers were really shopping for the price per pack or the unit price and so family sizes and party sizes became very important. Going forward or since a few months now, two quarters, I would say, many consumers that are below a certain income level have to shop by the total size of their basket. I would say that biscuits remain important for them. It is part of most shopping baskets. And as a consequence, we needed to fit our products within that shopping basket. And that meant that particularly the $3 to $4 price point has become very important. And so in Q3, we have worked with promotions to bring our products there. And going forward, we have launched a range of new packs on Chips Ahoy!, on Oreo, that will be sold at $2.99 And so we think that's the way we are bucking the trend really. So on one hand, category that the consumer really doesn't want to do without, and so the overall category is pretty stable. And on top of that, we're starting to gain some market share because we are hitting the right price points right now. Ken Goldman : Thank you for that. And then for my follow-up, I wanted to make sure I understood the comment about next year, the majority of the portfolio, being -- growing within algo on the top line. Is the implication that part of the portfolio, the minority will not be within algo? And just trying to get a real sense of what the messaging was there about the top line next year, just given all the puts and takes about elasticity and pricing and so forth? Dirk Van de Put : Yeah. It's basically related to our mix of different categories that we have. We have 70% of our business that is non-chocolate, and that is the part that we are expecting to be in line with our normal algo. And then the chocolate part will not be in line with our algo. That's what we were referring to. Luca Zaramella : On the bottom-line specifically. Ken Goldman : On the bottom line. So that was a bottom line comment just to make sure? Luca Zaramella : Yes. I said that 70% of the portfolio is on algo. The remaining part which is chocolate is not going to be on algo on the bottom line. Ken Goldman : Great. Thank you. Dirk Van de Put : We see pretty strong top line for next year. Ken Goldman : Yeah, that's why I wasn't -- no, that's helpful. Thank you. I appreciate it guys. Dirk Van de Put : Yeah. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Ken. Operator : We'll go next to John Baumgartner with Mizuho Securities. John Baumgartner : Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. Dirk Van de Put : Hi. Luca Zaramella : Hi. John Baumgartner : Dirk, I'd like to ask about the growth plans for cakes and pastries. And if you could speak to your vision there, to what extent do you view the company as sort of a disruptor in the space where there's unique capabilities in biscuits and confection that you can sort of leverage in baked goods? And in light of Evirth and that frozen cake technology, the capabilities from that, to what extent is that a China-specific opportunity relative to one that could be expanded to Europe, North America, some other markets? Just maybe your thoughts on where you see your advantages competing in the baked goods space? Thank you. Dirk Van de Put : Yes. Well, cakes and pastries -- packaged cakes and pastries is a $95 billion category. It's much bigger if you include the non-packets, but that's not the area that we consider as where we want to play. It is a category that's already growing 7% CAGR over the last five years, and in fact, low double-digit over the last two years. Per kilogram, it's higher value than the biscuits category. And the category is quite strong in some of the key markets where we play, the US, Europe, China. The opportunity is that it's a highly fragmented category. We are number three globally, but we only have a 3.5% share. So there is an opportunity to bring in known brands that come with a certain quality aspect and a certain positioning, but also by offering soft cakes or pastries that are in line with that brand from the biscuits category. So, an Oreo to play in that category, for instance, or some of our other brands. That is really the way we are thinking about it. Now, there's different techniques in producing these products. Evirth particularly, we already have a company that goes from frozen to fresh in the store, which is Give & Go in Canada, which is a company that's been growing very fast. And Evirth is similar, but to the sense that they are much more into the cake segment. In China, this category is really booming. These are quite sophisticated products. And I have to say that the quality that they can produce thanks to their proprietary way of producing is quite exceptional. And so we think that, first of all, in China, this is a big opportunity. The business has been growing serious double-digit for the last years, and we can see a long runway of possibilities. But we have started to think about, okay, how can we expand this to the rest of the world because the quality is so high. But for the time being, our first priority is to make sure that we get the strong growth that we would like to see in China. John Baumgartner : Thanks, Dirk. Dirk Van de Put : Okay. Operator : We'll go next to David Palmer with Evercore ISI. David Palmer : Thanks. Your comments on 25% were pretty clear in saying that you see -- hard to see a path to EPS growth in \u201825 that would likely require a breakdown in cocoa or sustained benign price elasticity that could enable perhaps earlier price offsets to what you're seeing. I wonder right now obviously you don't have that visibility into that and I wonder what the reality would be, when that reality would be that you could essentially feel like you could give a pretty narrow range of EPS outcomes for \u201925. Is it something that like by the first quarter earnings you would have that sort of a timeframe where you have pricing in place, you're seeing a reaction from that, perhaps you're a little further into your cocoa price setting for the year, I'm just wondering about the timing. Dirk Van de Put : Look, I think here, as I said there are two elements that will come into play. One is cocoa prices. There has been some nervousness in the market as of late, but we believe that it is the result of the fact that the industry is still quite short and that the Ivory Coast has hardly sold any \u201824, \u201825 crop in the last month since they're waiting for the new crop to materialize. On the fundamentals of cocoa, the latest spot count is likely below the five year average in Ivory Coast, same in Ghana, but it is well up versus last year. And the level of confidence that we have at this point in time is round about 85%, but it will be soon in the next couple of weeks, three weeks, 90%. Importantly, the Ivory Coast port arrivals are up 25% already versus prior year and that's really points in the direction of good supply coming our way. So I expect to have clarity on cocoa prices, call it, in the next month or couple of months. I think the situation will be much, much clear -- much more clear. Importantly, what will drive cocoa prices is the arrival in Europe, which will be most likely in January, February and I think by then we should really have a sense of cocoa cost. That is important because in our case, we haven't locked in cocoa prices yet. We want to take advantage of the potential decline of cocoa costs, albeit we want also to be protected on the upper side of cost. On the other side, on the level of elasticity, look, I think you know that it takes a little bit of time to implement price in Europe. And I think we're going to see in places like the UK where we don't have buying alliances, we are going to see the effect of elasticities much earlier and quite honestly from what we see today, they are already quite good in terms of not having a big impact. For the rest of Europe, we will have to wait towards the end of Q1 beginning of Q2. In emerging markets, as I said, we're going to price quite rapidly, but there we will protect price points in the entry level. So a long way to say cocoa cost should be clear by the end of this year beginning of Q1 and prices particularly in Europe will be much clearer towards the end of Q1 beginning of Q2. David Palmer : That's very helpful. And I guess I want to just pick your brain on just the US snacking, Ken asked you about why cookies, perhaps is doing towards the high end of the snacking category, which is historically weak right now. Obviously, you're a global snacking player, and you participate in confectionery outside the US in a bigger way, but confectionery in the US is particularly weak. I'm wondering why you think confectionery in the US is so weak right now, and if there's any sort of interesting juxtapositions you could create between those two, what you see for example in developed market Europe and with chocolate and the price receptivity for example and the consumer versus what we see in the US which seems to be pretty rough right now? Thanks. Luca Zaramella : Look, it's really tough for us to comment about the chocolate market in the USA because as you know we have a small participation in that market and because there are other companies that might have a much better point of view. What we can tell you is, in Europe and in emerging markets, our brands have been built consistently over the years. In terms of distribution, support, price point, we have never pulled back a dollar since [Dirk arrived] (ph) in terms of advertising. We have been increasing consistently. Our marketing capabilities with our Chief Marketing Officer have improved dramatically. The execution is there. So I think in our case at least, we have been consistent in executing and investing and increasing distribution of our brands throughout. And look, we're lucky to have our brands maybe, but those are being built by people at Mondelez and we're very proud of that. Operator : We'll move next to Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Peter Galbo : Hey, guys. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Luca, I just wanted to actually circle back on your comment on \u201825 EPS, the path to difficult growth. Just for real clarity, does that also include the dilution from JDE or is that on a like-for-like basis just so we're crystal clear? Luca Zaramella : No, I was quoting like-for-like. We will issue in due time an 8-K. You might imagine by looking at the multiple of JV, Pete, even when we got 30% premium to the unaffected stock price, you might imagine that multiple is lower compared to ours. So even if we had to buy back our stock, there will be some sort of dilution, which is not something that I meant to comment upon when I was telling you that we don't see a path to EPS growth into next year. Peter Galbo : Got it. Okay. No, that's helpful. Thank you. And just to go back to Europe, I think you were expecting a bit of pipeline fill in the quarter post the customer disruption. Just curious if you can unpack that a bit more, just did it come in where you kind of thought it would, is there an expectation of more of that just in the Q4? Any additional color would be helpful. Thanks very much. Luca Zaramella : Look, there was no much, I mean there was pipeline building particularly at the beginning of the quarter, but that was pipeline for back-to-school activities. I can tell you for instance that impact is not really material at all. Again, quite frankly in the case of the UK, we had planned to ship some Christmas already in Q3 that didn't happen, it's going to happen in Q4. So all in all, I wouldn't call the pipelining effect in Europe as material. Operator : We'll go next to Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Chris Carey : Hi, good evening. So, Luca, this is a follow-up question, then I'll just ask one quick other one. But on the confidence around cocoa in the coming three, four weeks, say, relative to just your expectations for next year, can you just talk about how much flexibility you might have to respond from a productivity standpoint, say, if those expectations get worse over the next month or obviously we know if they get better, that's obviously helpful. But just as you think about the ability to manage through different variability and maybe hold to the expectations that you have for next year as you sit here today, just how much flexibility do you have to respond within your early budgets if, say, things get worse from the overhead or the productivity or the other things that you mentioned? Luca Zaramella : So, we have clear coverage strategies. I think at this point in time, we have a good part of our 2025 cocoa needs covered and/or protected. And the way you have to think about it is, we put in place futures for around about half of the needs that we have and when we put that in place, I was very clear that we covered mostly the second part of the year as the structure is inverted and so you have a benefit by going further out. The rest is covered through mostly colors and which allow us -- would allow us to really participate if the market had to adjust down, but at the same time protecting the upside exposure. So we have quite a bit of flexibility, I would say, on the -- should the market adjust. The pricing plans and there is a big part of RGM I would say, I think one-third of the pricing next year is going to be done through RGM that is maybe a little bit less flexible, but the rest provide us with some flexibility. So if we see elasticity is being more benign, we could hump up the pricing there or if for that matter we see more severe volume reaction we could lower prices a little bit more. So we have built that flexibility into the plan. Chris Carey : Okay, thanks. And then just one quick follow-up on a couple of regions. Latin America volume has decelerated a bit here through the year. We've been hearing that from another -- a number of your global peers just around hitting kind of tougher comps relative to last year. Can you just comment on the underlying of the business right now? And then on the China piece, you mentioned you're seeing some optimism there. Is that something you're seeing? Or is it just optimism at this point? So that's it for me. Thanks. Dirk Van de Put : Yes. Well, on Latin America, I would say, overall, we still feel pretty good about Latin America. It is true that volume has started to go into negative territory, but that is driven largely by Mexico in our case. Brazil, we still see a very strong performance and also in what we call WACAM, which is largely everything else except Argentina. So it is really concentrated in one country. And there, it's largely because we have some pricing adjustments that we need to do, particularly in the candy and the chocolate categories. But for instance, gum meals and Oreo are doing quite well in Mexico. So I wouldn't feel that Latin America is particularly a major problem area for us, but it certainly has slowed down versus what it was in the previous quarters. Operator : We will take our final question from Tom Palmer\u2026 Dirk Van de Put : Sorry, I still needed to talk about China and why we see optimism. So overall, we have a very good performance in China. Businesses are doing quite well. We have mid-single-digit volume mix growth. We have high single-digit net revenue growth. So despite the economic slowdown, we feel pretty good. And I wasn't talking about our optimism. I think there is some consumer optimism because the government has released some economic boosting policy, which we are monitoring, and we think that is going to affect overall consumer thinking and consumer buying. We think our category biscuits will be stable with some big shifts in channels towards snack chains and club warehouses, which are, for instance, out of the Nielsen scope. So that is something that is on top of what you can see in the data. So we think overall driven by a strong category and the distribution gains that we have, we're probably more optimistic about China than most other companies, but we do feel an underlying trend that the consumer is getting in more positive territory. Operator : We'll move to our final question from Tom Palmer with Citi. Tom Palmer : Good evening and thank you. I wanted to ask first on organic sales growth. The guidance would seem to imply an acceleration in the fourth, perhaps even versus what we saw in 3Q. Could you help frame the regions in which this improvement might be most apparent? And then just to confirm, this would be volume driven? Or are there some pricing actions to consider in the fourth quarter with then more coming in 2025? Luca Zaramella : As far as pricing is concerned, at this point in time we are done and so there is no sequential additional pricing coming into effect in Q4. I think you're going to see strong performance in North America. You're going to see strong performance in AMEA, which by the way we start lapping the boycotts that started last year in Q4. And then I think in Europe, you are going to see strong results as well. Latin America, we have been a little bit more conservative, but I think there should be a little bit of an improvement there too. Look, in the end, if you do the implied growth rate for Q4 in light of us the affirming guidance on top line, which is as we said at the high end of the 3 to 5 algo, you should get to a Q4 that is a little bit higher than what Q3 has been. Tom Palmer : Okay. Thanks for that. Dirk Van de Put : Okay. I think that was the last question, Shep. Well, thank you for attending the call. Strong quarter, and we hope that we will do well in 2025 also. And I hope you got convinced that our plans are in place to make that happen. Talk to you next time. Thank you. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, everyone. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Mondelez International Fourth Quarter 2024 and Full Year Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is scheduled to last about one hour, including remarks by Mondelez management and the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to Mr. Shep Dunlap, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations for Mondelez. Please go ahead, sir. Shep Dunlap : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Dirk Van de Put, our Chairman and CEO; and Luca Zaramella, our CFO. Earlier today, we sent out our press release and presentation slides, which are available on our website. During this call, we'll make forward-looking statements about the company's performance. These statements are based on how we see things today. Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K filings for more details on our forward-looking statements. As we discuss our results today, unless noted as reported, we'll be referencing our non-GAAP financial measures, which adjust for certain items included in our GAAP results. In addition, we provide year-over-year growth on a constant currency basis unless otherwise noted. You can find the comparable GAAP measures and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations within our earnings release and at the back of the slide presentation. Today, Dirk will provide a business strategy update, followed by a review of our financial results and outlook by Luca. We will close with Q&A. I'll now turn the call over to Dirk. Dirk Van De Put : Thank you, Shep, and thanks to everyone for joining the call today. I will start on Slide 4. I'm pleased to share that 2024 was another strong year for Mondelez. We delivered balanced top line growth, strong earnings and robust free cash flow generation, while returning significant capital back to shareholders. Our top line grew mid-single digit, with balanced performance across both developed and emerging markets, and we delivered positive volume mix in the second half of the year with improved share performance. Despite continuing input cost inflation, we achieved gross profit dollar growth in the mid-single digits, driven by ongoing cost discipline and sound pricing. This allowed us to continue to increase our investments in brands, distribution and organizational capabilities. We also continued our track record of strong free cash flow, generating $3.5 billion, which includes our settlement with the EU Commission. We also continued to prioritize capital return, delivering $4.7 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. And as we transition into 2025, we remain focused on executing with excellence against our long term growth strategy. We are confident that our chocolate playbook will enable us to successfully navigate unprecedented cocoa cost inflation, and we'll share additional color later in today's call. Perhaps most importantly, I remain convinced that team Mondelez represents the very best people in the consumer packaged goods business, and I'm proud of our team for staying focused and agile in a challenging operating environment. With the right strategy, the right brands, the right geographic footprint and the right people, I'm confident that we continue to be solidly positioned for attractive long term growth. Turning to Slide 5. You can see that 2024 was a strong year on both the top and bottom lines despite the impact of cocoa cost phasing in the fourth quarter. Luca will provide some additional perspectives on our cocoa cost strategy in a few minutes. We delivered organic net revenue growth of 4.3% and adjusted gross profit dollar growth of 5.1% for the year. Our volume mix results demonstrate that consumers continue to prioritize our brands and our categories. It is important to underscore that we continued reinvesting in our brands to drive faster growth. Our high-single digit investment increase in A&C continues to strengthen consumer and customer loyalty to our brands. Adjusted EPS grew 13% on top of strong growth in the past several years, and we delivered free cash flow of $3.5 billion. We remain confident that our commitment to executing with excellence while reinvesting in our strong brands, capabilities and talent will enable us to continue delivering attractive long term value for our stakeholders. On Slide 6, you can see that our continued confidence is grounded in evidence of consumers' enduring preference for snacking. All over the world, snacks remain an important part of people's lives, at home, at work or school, and on the go. We're proud that consumers continue to prioritize our strong brands even in challenging times. In North America, consumer confidence has improved slightly following the U.S. election, despite continuing concern about the economic outlook. While biscuit category volume remained relatively flat over the last three months, private label continues to decline, demonstrating that consumers remain loyal to their favorite brands and that our price pack architecture initiatives are showing promising signs. As a result, Oreo, Chips Ahoy! and Ritz, all are regaining share. Meanwhile, in Europe, consumer confidence and also price elasticities remained stable despite ongoing uncertainty in the economic and political environment. We continue to see solid category value growth in both biscuits and chocolate, and our brands are steadily gaining share following disruption during the first half of the year. Elasticities also remained stable in emerging markets, with solid consumer confidence in India, Brazil and Mexico amidst continued softness in China. Overall, we're seeing solid category growth in both volume and value across our combined emerging markets, and Mondelez share is improving in both biscuits and chocolate. Turning to Slide 7. We are continuing to make progress against our strategic growth agenda, reinvesting in our brands, expanding distribution, strengthening our capabilities and continuing to transform our portfolio. Here are just a few highlights of our strategy in action. Our iconic global brands, including Oreo and Cadbury Dairy Milk, executed award winning activations that resonated strongly with consumers, driving incremental lift. For example, Oreo's Space Dunk campaign and our innovative global collaboration with Coca Cola helped strengthen partnerships with key retailers around the world. Similarly, Cadbury's year-long celebration of its 200th anniversary delivered ground breaking creative and strong return on investment. Looking ahead, we are excited about the potential of our just announced Oreo partnership with Post Malone, which will hit U.S. store shelves later this week. Capturing the current cultural vibe, this limited edition features our first ever Twisted Cream. Along with these creative brand reinvestments, we continue to expand distribution around the world, which includes a special focus on accelerating digital channels. Our e-commerce business grew double-digits in 2024, and we continue investing in new capabilities to accelerate our leadership in digital snacking. In fact, our next tier markets grew approximately 35% in 2024, as a result of our continued investments. We are also making significant progress on growing our revenue growth management capabilities. We launched new fresh stacks (ph) during Q4 across our largest U.S. brands, including Oreo, Ritz and Chips Ahoy. These new offerings provide products our consumers love in smaller hold fresh packs at an attractive everyday price. And in chocolate, we are launching an array of pack sizes at several new price points around the world. Additionally, we continue to advance our portfolio reshaping strategy. In 2024, we purchased a majority stake in Evirth, the leader in China's fast growing frozen-to-chilled baked snacks category. We have worked with Evirth for several years to develop, manufacture, market and sell cakes and pastries, featuring some of our iconic brands, including Oreo and Philadelphia. Our expanded partnership enables us to further accelerate growth through continuous innovation, leveraging the combination of our high value brands with Evirth's advanced R&D and technical expertise. We also liquidated our investment in JDE Peet's, providing another important source of funding for reinvestment that can be used to buy our stock as well as further advancing our brands, talent and capabilities. On Slide 8, along with our financial performance and strategic growth priorities, I'm pleased to share that we made significant progress towards our sustainability objectives in 2024. First, we continued to advance our leadership in more sustainably sourcing critical ingredients. About 90% of the cocoa volume used in our chocolate brands now is sourced through Cocoa Life, our signature cocoa sourcing program, which works to lift up the people and restore landscapes where cocoa is grown. We also made continued progress in helping to combat climate change. We reduced carbon emissions across our manufacturing operations by about 38% versus our baseline in 2018. Additionally, we continued advancing our Light and Right packaging strategy. Approximately 96% of our packaging is recyclable. We also continue investing in ways to empower consumers to make more mindful snacking choices that fit into their healthy active lifestyles. Approximately 80% of our snacks revenue comes from mindful portion snacks, that is snacks that are packaged in individually wrapped mindful portion serving sizes or with clear mindful portion recommendations on the pack. These are just a few preliminary highlights of our continuing progress towards building a more sustainable snacking company. We continue to believe that helping to drive positive change at scale is an integral part of value creation, with positive returns for our stakeholders. We encourage you to watch our Annual Snacking Made Right report, which will be published in April to view our full year sustainability data. Turning to Slide 9. I'd like to reinforce our conviction that Mondelez remains well positioned to navigate through a very dynamic operating environment. Like many other companies, we are closely tracking and planning around several near term themes, including variations in consumer confidence, foreign exchange volatility, potential changes in trade policy and pricing negotiations, all against the backdrop of record cocoa prices. By focusing on our strengths and controlling our controllables, we are confident that we have the right strategy, the right execution and the right people to effectively navigate these headwinds. Our teams have undertaken extensive planning since last spring for the challenges created by record cocoa input costs. We have a clear and sound strategy to navigate these conditions, which Luca will describe in more detail in a few minutes. At the same time, our categories remain resilient and consumers continue to prioritize our iconic snacking brands. We remain committed to reinvesting in our brands and capabilities to continue accelerating this momentum. We also continue to focus on expanding distribution opportunities in both developed and emerging markets. And our disciplined approach to capital allocation gives us confidence that we will continue to generate strong free cash flow. In conclusion, I'm pleased to reiterate that 2024 was another strong year and that we are well positioned to continue driving attractive growth. While the road ahead will not be without challenges, our team is at its best when we are united and clear about what we need to do. By continuing to double down our attractive core categories of chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks, investing in our widely loved brands, focusing on operational execution and cost discipline, and empowering our great people, I am confident that we can deliver strong performance for years to come. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca to share additional insights on our financials. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Dirk, and good afternoon. In 2024, we delivered strong results from top to bottom. We posted balanced growth across developed and emerging markets. We grew gross profit dollars by mid-single digits, adjusted EPS growth was double-digit and free cash flow was once again quite good. This was a continuation of our virtuous cycle, which enables us to maintain strong growth, important reinvestments and strong return of capital back to shareholders. Revenue growth was 4.3% in the year, with volume mix down 1 point. For the quarter, growth was more than 5%, with a slight increase in volume mix. Emerging markets grew by 6.2% for the year and 6.7% for the quarter, with trends coming from a substantial number of key countries, including China, Brazil, South Africa, the Western Andean, and Central and Eastern Europe. Developed markets grew 3.2% for the year and 4.3% for the quarter, including strong growth from Europe and solid results from the U.S. Moving to portfolio performance on Slide 12. Our chocolate and biscuit businesses both delivered good growth for the year. Also, gum and candy continued to perform well. Biscuits grew 1.7% for the year and 2.1% for the quarter. Several brands delivered attractive growth for 2024, including Oreo, Ritz, belVita, Tate's, 7DAYS, Club Social and Perfect Snacks. Chocolate grew 7.4% for the year and 8.9% for the quarter, with significant growth across both developed and emerging markets. Volume mix declined 2% for the year and 2.3% in the quarter. Our two flagship global brands, Cadbury Dairy Milk and Milka, delivered outstanding growth, while we also delivered strong growth with our local jewels portfolio, including Lacta, Cote D'Or, Freia and Marabou. Gum and candy grew more than 7% for the year and nearly 9% for the quarter. Key markets, including China, Brazil and Western Andean, all performed well. Let's review market share performance on Slide 13. We held or gained share in 50% of our revenue base, with strong results in both chocolate and biscuits. Although there is more work to do, we made strong progress in the back half of the year, including the last three months as approximately 17% of revenue had or gained share due to improvements in North America biscuits. Strong brand reinvestment, revenue growth management initiatives and solid execution helped drive recent improvements. Moving to regional performance on Slide 14. Europe grew 5.7% for the year and 7.4% for the quarter. Strong execution, including pricing, led to attractive growth despite significant customer disruption in half one. OI dollars in '24 were up 8.8% for the year and down more than 40% in Q4. The sharp decline in European Q4 profit was driven by the dramatic ramp in our cocoa cost pipeline without the benefit of additional pricing and cost measures that are expected in 2025. North America grew 1.5% for the full year, while Q4 grew 0.4%. Full year growth was driven by solid performance across a number of brands and growth channels. In Q4, volume mix grew 1.3 percentage points, driven by growth in our new fresh stacks price packs as well as trends from Tate's and Perfect Snacks. Overall, we saw a good start with the rollout of the new price packs in Oreo, Chips Ahoy! and Ritz. We entered '25 encouraged by our new price packs, expectations for category growth and initiatives around growth channel, trade programs and new distribution growth. North America OI increased 0.4% for the year. For the quarter, OI decreased 11.5%. This decline was a result of higher trade spend, some cost pressure, particularly as we ramp up production of the newly launched price point SKU and a settlement of a legal case. AMEA grew 6.2% for the year and 8.6% for the quarter, with solid volume mix growth to finish the year. China grew high-single digits for the year and quarter. Australia posted strong growth for both the year and quarter, as well as Southeast Asia returned to growth in Q4. India delivered low-single digit growth for the year and quarter, as strength in chocolate was offset by soft biscuit results. We are encouraged by work being done in India and in the biscuits business specifically around smaller packs and lower price points as we head into 2025. AMEA increased OI dollars by 13.4% for the year, while OI declined 28% in Q4, resulting from unfavorable cocoa phasing. Latin America grew 4.6% for the year and 4.9% for the quarter behind solid performance from Brazil and the Western Andean group of countries. Latin America delivered another strong year of profitability. OI grew 10.7% for the year, while declining 5.7% for Q4. Profitability was lower in the quarter, driven by cocoa. Turning to Page 15. For the year, we delivered strong high-single digit OI dollar growth. This growth enables significant level of reinvestments in our brands and capabilities for '25 and beyond. In Q4, we saw a notable decline in OI dollars growth. This decline was primarily a result of unfavorable cocoa pipeline that we noted in our Q3 call. These cost headwinds came without additional offsets in pricing or overheads reduction, which we expect to initiate in 2025. Next to EPS on Slide 16. Full year EPS grew 13% in constant currency. The significant majority of this growth was driven by operating gains. And despite currency headwinds, we grew adjusted EPS at reported ForEx by more than 9%. Q4 EPS growth declined due to previously mentioned spike in the cocoa cost pipeline. Turning to Slide 17. We delivered $3.5 billion of free cash flow for the full year, including the settlement of the EU Commission matter of nearly $400 million. We returned $4.7 billion in cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase, with nearly half of our share repurchase coming in Q4. Consistent with our capital allocation priorities, we announced a new $9 billion share repurchase authorization in December, which runs from '25 through '27. We continue to be opportunistic buyers of our stock at depressed levels, given our view of the intrinsic value. Before we get into the details of our outlook, let me provide additional thoughts on cocoa. The market continues to show signs of volatility and has reverted to elevated levels during much of the past three months. Despite a good main crop, several factors have contributed to this situation, including concerns about the mid-crop in the Ivory Coast, ongoing low liquidity and low industry coverage. This backdrop has created more pressure on our P&L for '25 as it relates to the portion that was still unhedged or protected through flexible structures at the time we spoke to you back in the Q3 call. Although, we cannot predict specific timing, we continue to believe that the inverted nature of the market, combined with lower demand levels due to higher pricing and elasticity, will eventually bring cocoa to a more sustainable price level. As Dirk mentioned, we have been planning our '25 business for some time now in advance on -- of elevated levels of cocoa, and we have developed a clear and comprehensive chocolate strategy. This includes leveraging a robust RGM playbook, strong marketing and sales execution, remaining agile with the right incentives and targeted cost savings. A few words on 2025 and key planning assumptions on Slide 20. For the current year, we expect to deliver on our long term algorithm for revenue. We currently expect top line to be approximately 5%. We have planned for higher levels of elasticity in chocolate, but we need to remain agile and assess the situation as new prices get implemented. We expect an adjusted EPS decline this year, given the unprecedented levels of cocoa cost in our chocolate canal. This decline is expected to be approximately 10% versus the base of $3.36 in 2024, that excludes JDE Peet's from the equity income. This outlook does not include the impact of the potentially significant new executive orders imposing 25% tariffs on U.S. imports from Mexico and Canada. This would create an additional headwind to the business, but given the fluid and rapidly changing nature of timing, it is difficult to provide a reliable estimate of impact for the full year at this time. Overall, we believe this outlook is a prudent planning stance based on our visibility to cocoa costs in 2025, which is substantially protected and hedged at this point. This assumption is based on the principles I just discussed. Based on our view of earnings, we are planning for free cash flow of $3 billion plus. In terms of other key assumptions, for inflation, we expect a double-digit increase for 2025 versus 2024, driven almost entirely by cocoa as well as some labor costs. In terms of interest expense, we expect approximately $350 million. We expect an adjusted effective tax rate in the mid-20s. Note that our cash tax rate is expected to run approximately 2 points lower than this rate. And for share repurchase, we are expecting at least $3 billion, with the flexibility to go higher depending on stock price. We are expecting approximately $0.12 of EPS headwind related to ForEx for the year. Before opening up for Q&A, a few comments on 2026. In 2025, we are trying to strike the right balance by running a reasonable P&L, while taking a responsible and thoughtful approach to maintaining the health of the chocolate category. In that context, we continue to scrutinize every dollar we spend, including A&C, where we'll continue to prioritize brand investments and properly support brands as long as we believe the return is sufficient. We do expect EPS growth in 2026 based on cocoa levels staying elevated, but stable. Cocoa futures might come down, but we're not there yet. So, we will continue to plan various scenarios, with the base case for a continuation of elevated levels. If cocoa stays high, we would expect to gradually price more. If cocoa starts to come down, then we would expect earnings delivery to be higher. Regardless, we expect EPS growth in 2026. With that, let's open the line for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Andrew Lazar : Great. Thanks so much. Appreciate it. Dirk, maybe to start, given where cocoa has gone in the past few months, maybe you can talk about how that, if at all, sort of, changes your approach and chocolate strategy, and with that, the state of the European business, given that's your largest chocolate market, and it seems like even more price will likely be necessary even into '26? Dirk Van De Put : Yes. Well, hello, Andrew, and thanks for the question. Well, as it relates to cocoa and chocolate, the first thing I would say is that, in our eyes, chocolate remains a great snacking category, which so far has been remarkably durable. It's been quite robust in '24 already with some significant pricing, but still healthy volumes. That's driven by the fact that there is iconic brands, iconic brands that we have and others have, that are taste of the nation, high brand loyalty, there's very little private label. Consumers quote, chocolate as one of their indulgences that they cannot live without. So, we continue to feel that this is a great snacking category. Our view is that despite the short-term volatility that our approach needs to be to protect the category health, to protect our share in the category and to protect our brand investments. We are seeing some structural change to the cocoa pricing in the cocoa market, but we don't think that will continue to the current magnitude. For sure, cocoa prices will remain high than they've been in the past, but they will come down eventually from the current high to our opinion. The other thing I would say is that, from our view, we need to protect key price points and thresholds, so that consumers can continue to enjoy their chocolate. So, that means, in emerging markets, we continue to hold the price points of our low unit pricing. And in the developed markets, we try to make sure that we have the right entry level. We accompany that in '25 with very strong revenue growth management plans and PPA plans to make sure that the consumers can have consumption at all different price points. We are going to continue to invest in the category. We are optimizing that investment, but we will continue to support our brands strongly. Of course, we will do some additional cost measures to protect the bottom line. So, as I said, we're trying to optimize our A&C investment. We're looking at zero overhead or negative overhead growth, and we have the highest supply chain productivity program in the history of the company for 2025. And we will continue to hedge our chocolate. We don't see a reason to change our strategy there. So, for '25, we have a very strong agenda. We have an enormous revenue growth management program. We have changed the price pack architecture on more than $5 billion of our net revenue. We have to do significant line pricing, which we are implementing as we speak. If cocoa prices remain elevated where they are today, that might require more pricing in the second half of this year and in '26. But as I said, we think eventually, cocoa prices will start to come down. There already has been some significant pricing around the world in chocolate. And I'm happy to report that the elasticities have held up well. So, we're looking at a 0.4 elasticity. And so far, what we've seen even in the places where we've had 10%, 15% price increase, that holds. We are also, of course, looking at optimizing our promotions. We're doing active portfolio management. Elasticities, we have estimated around 0.4, I was mentioning. We will need to remain agile and adapt to the circumstances. But overall, we do believe that we have the right strategy. We have very strong activations and innovations also planned. We are launching new flavors, new experiences. We have the biggest seasonal agenda in chocolate. We are starting and launching products in our Biscoff partnership. So, that also we think will drive consumer interest. We are monitoring consumers very closely and that gives us reason for optimism. So far, we don't see any major shifts. And if you then look at the P&L of chocolate for '25, our main objective is to protect the category, protect our share. And we think we can do that with a reasonable P&L, and I'm sure that Luca will talk a little bit more about that, which includes significant investments and robust activations. And we are not taking any short cuts for short term gains. So, that's a little bit the way we look at chocolate. If I translate that to Europe, at this stage, consumer confidence in Europe is pretty stable. It's subdued, but it's stable. The purchasing power is soft. There is ongoing economic and political uncertainty, of course. But overall, we feel that the consumer is in a good place, probably in a better place as the consumer is in the U.S. The category consumption in chocolate is pretty good. We have very solid value growth. We have good volume growth. We're seeing a little bit of deceleration in the last three months, but that's because pricing is starting to come. And as I said, the elasticities are as expected. For instance, in the U.K., we're looking at a 0.37 elasticity so far and we've already increased prices by about 15%. So, I think after we had client disruption in the beginning of the year, we saw a very good business continuation in Europe. We had broad based growth across the region. Chocolate was growing 8% in value over the last three months for us. We had the highest Christmas net revenue in chocolate, a double-digit growth. We're seeing very nice growth across channels from discounters to world travel retail, and we had a great share performance. So, everything so far in Europe is good. And as you can see from the numbers, so the quarter and the year looks pretty good, except, of course, for the cocoa effect, but that over time will start to go down as our pricing takes hold. So, for '25, we have this big RGM agenda. We have the activations of promotions. We do assume in our estimates at the moment client disruption. The chocolate P&L will gradually improve as pricing takes hold, and we still have some significant pricing and PPA to do, but we do believe that we have the right estimates in our forecast. So, pretty optimistic about the chocolate category and we do feel that our European business is well prepared to deal with this. Andrew Lazar : That's awesome. Thanks so much for that very fulsome answer. And then, Luca, just quickly, can you walk us through some of the puts and takes for the '25 outlook in terms of, like, phasing around EPS and margins? And although early, just how do we think about the key considerations for '26 that you kind of got into briefly in the prepared remarks? Thanks so much. Luca Zaramella : Yeah. Thank you, Andrew. As far as the 2025 guidance goes, I think we have to start by saying that we feel good about how we ended the year in terms of revenue and growth momentum. As we just said, we feel quite good with the benign elasticities in chocolate. Total growth of the categories where we compete was good. And importantly, I think we were happy to see share momentum picking up. So, this is good news given that 70% of the business is non-chocolate, and we expect a normal year in terms of biscuit, bakeries and other categories. Chocolate profitability is clearly the main concern of the plan. And as I said, in the prepared remarks, the chocolate spikes in the last few months have given us a little bit of a headwind compared to what we told you and we anticipated back in October. So, we have beefed up the plan in terms of pricing actions and RGM. And as we just said, we need to continue to strike a good balance, especially in emerging markets between price and volume. To offset some of the profit pressure, we have unprecedented cost measures, I would say, particularly in the productivity area of our manufacturing network, but we also have reduced overheads and the non-working media spending. So, our goal is to deliver a plan that is executing well in all non-chocolate category. And for chocolate, I think, the key will be to minimize the volume implications, together with ensuring that we exit 2025 with a reasonable profit per kilo as a key measure for us to monitor. The profit gating throughout 2025 will be more pressured in Q1, given the fact that we are in the midst of negotiations with customer and we haven't implemented the price yet, but we feel quite good at this point given the progress we have made. And I think you will start seeing profit improvement in terms of sequential improvement versus Q1 and Q4 as we progress throughout the year. And again, the clear goal for us is to end 2025 in a place where we are well positioned to deliver EPS growth in 2026. Clearly, it is quite premature to talk about 2026, but we wanted you to hear very clearly that our goal is to grow EPS for 2026. At this point in time, we see a bifurcation of scenarios into 2026. I believe the most likely scenario is that cocoa prices will come down, in which case, we will have higher earnings upside potential. But if cocoa stays elevated, we will have to take a little bit more pricing. And our approach over the last few years and in '24 as well is to take multiple pricing actions and to allow consumers to get accustomed to higher levels of pricing. And so, we believe that in either case, whether cocoa comes down or stays high, we have a path to delivering EPS growth into 2026. Andrew Lazar : Thanks so much. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Andrew. Operator : We'll move next to Ken Goldman with J.P. Morgan. Kenneth Goldman : Hi. Thank you, Dirk. In North America, both price and volume mix came in below the Street in the fourth quarter. I'm curious, can you maybe expand on how you view the general health of the biscuit category here in the U.S., and also your expectations roughly for both volume and price in 2025 in North America in light of how you think about that category and your share within? Dirk Van De Put : Yes. Hi, Ken. Well, the consumer in U.S. is still quite concerned, the economy, the political situation and, of course, inflation. And as we've talked in the past, the value definition has clearly changed in most categories, I would say, but also in the biscuit category. Basically, higher income consumers are trying to buy bigger packs, while lower income consumers are focused on lower unit prices. And also, the channel shopping behavior has significantly changed. I would say at this stage, the U.S. biscuit category is softer. The elasticities are increasing to a certain degree. The category growth in the last three months was 0.6%. We did improve our shares during that period, but overall, I would call that soft. The good news is that the penetration and the volume per trip is holding up. There's a number of reasons for that. First of all, prices have stopped rising. In fact, prices have probably come down, and that's part of what you see in Q4, because we launched a number of packs at lower price points, and the promo intensity is also increasing. I would say, within the category, cookies are performing in line with broiler (ph) snacking, while crackers are softer. Q4, while maybe below the market estimates, was, to our opinion, solid quarter. We had a net revenue growth of 0.4%, volume mix was 1.3%. OI was lower, but the reasons for that was first of all, we were lapping a lower trade spend last year and we were also lapping some SG&A one-timers, but the good news for us was that we grew biscuit share with more than 30 basis points in Q4. We did a number of innovations, as I mentioned, fresh tax and launched, for instance, the Chips Ahoy! Chewy Cookie and we had very good channel results also. The one that was a bit of a decliner was give and go, that had to see with the fact that our kids business declined to pre-COVID levels. If I look at '25 for the category, I would say -- sorry, the pricing possibilities are limited, will have a little bit. We will continue to do PPA for lower price points. We will have some very strong activations. You'll see the first one with Post Malone on Oreo as is currently going on. I do think that we will have a good volume growth next year because of those lower price points and the fact that we have under developed channels, plus we can drive more penetration of some of our brands. So, I think we will combine a good volume growth with lower pricing. So, maybe our percentage gross profit will come down, but we do think that the dollars that we will generate will be quite strong. So, I'm expecting a solid P&L in North America in '25. Kenneth Goldman : That's helpful. And then, quickly, Luca, just on cocoa, I think you and Dirk have been using the word eventually more than usual today. It may be fair, maybe not, but it seems like you're incrementally less confident today that cocoa is bound to fall in the near-term. So, I'm curious, has anything structurally changed in your view of supply and demand or is this just a situation where you have to sort of at least partially just kind of accept the current reality, whether it's justified or not? Luca Zaramella : Look, I think it is tougher for us, quite frankly, to make sense of the current elevated prices. Yes, it is through the mid-crop, which, I remind you, account for 30% of the total year production of cocoa is subdued and there was a little bit of a drier weather than was anticipated. The reality is, as of today, the port arrivals are up almost 25%. And I believe even in the worst case scenario of the mid-crop being sub-par, we foresee most likely a supply increase compared to last year, that is around about 10%. The latest grinding numbers have been quite good. And so, demand doesn't factor yet, major changes, but we start seeing signs, particularly in parts of the world like North America, where cocoa consumption is coming down. And so, that should provide, I believe, on a longer term perspective, a little bit of a relief in terms of also demand. I think the market is very thin. If you look at the industry, it is covered very shortly. If you look at volume that gets traded daily, it is very, very small. And obviously, in this environment, we see particularly speculators to drive cost prices that are elevated. So, look, I think I was really hoping that by now, with the main crop behind us and the good numbers, cocoa will be more benign, but it isn't. And so, we have assumed a cocoa price that stays elevated for '25. And in our plans, it is elevated for 2026 as well in the sense that we prefer planning that way, rather than assuming and having an assumption that drives EPS growth simply because of cocoa coming down. We are committing to you that EPS in 2026 will grow either way and we want to be ready for the worst. But quite frankly, given that I believe there will be a surplus between supply and demand in 2025, I believe eventually cocoa will have to come down. Kenneth Goldman : Thank you very much. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, Ken. Operator : We'll move next to David Palmer with Evercore ISI. David Palmer : Yeah. Thanks. Just a theoretical follow-up on that. You mentioned that you believe that cocoa prices would return to a more sustainable price level. And I'm wondering whatever that level is, it might not be the $3,000 where we were not that long ago and it might not be the $10,000 we're at now. But let's say, $5,000, $6,000, whatever it is, and we get to that place in the next one or two years, is it your belief that you will have the ability and that you will ultimately get to a point where you're pricing away the dollar input inflation and that essentially over a multi-year period, your algorithm will normalize? Is that still your belief? Luca Zaramella : Yes. I think what you have to assume is that just picking the numbers that you have quoted, $3,000 and I don't know if you are talking about dollars or GBP, but call it GBP. We will be priced at the level that is higher than that. And so, I think the question becomes that, that level of cocoa, how quickly are we going to adjust, if any adjustment is made, prices down. And I think as much as the restriction going up and as much as we are never priced throughout, I would say, the next couple of quarters at the right level of cocoa, it is fine to assume that as cocoa starts coming down, our price too will be better than the $3,000 you quoted. And so, in that context, our profitability will be quite good and would allow us to have a P&L that makes more than sense. And so, I think if cocoa comes down, earnings power is there. If cocoa stays high, which again we don't control, we will have to price a little bit more in 2026. And as I said, in a previous question, this approach of multiple pricing waves is the best in terms of getting consumers accustomed to new price levels and minimizing elasticity and volume losses. David Palmer : And then -- thank you for that. And then, just as you're sort of reviewing cocoa prices and the -- I would imagine that the visibility on the pass crop is behind us. I'm wondering what are you going to be watching and when will you make up your mind about the need for additional pricing? Like, what sort of time frames are you kind of under -- are we under review here? Is this something that you're going to make a decision to pivot by the time we get to the second half of this year? How will that work? Luca Zaramella : Yeah. So, I think for '25, we are pretty much done in terms of coverage. And now what we have assumed at this point is that we will have to take multiple price waves and there are situations where we have two other situations where we're going to take three price increases. As Dirk said, we have an unprecedented amount of RGM, which has come to fruition throughout the year. And so, we are planning, for the current levels of cocoa, a series of actions that we will take throughout 2025. Now, if we realize that the main crop numbers with which we're going to start getting a sense towards September, October, if we realize that demand of cocoa in general is coming down and the number of -- will be coming out throughout the year, but the first half will give us an indication of how much global demand is subdued and in -- and we will try to understand the price implication on cocoa. We will decide as we go what is best to do for the second part of the year in light of a plausible cocoa level for 2026. And so, quite frankly, we have to remain quite open to understanding what cocoa is going to do in 2026. And as a consequence, we will act accordingly, particularly in the second part of the year. The first pricing waves according to the level of cocoa that we have today had been taken between October and December in few cases. We are under European negotiations literally as we speak. There might be other pricing waves that we'll take in the second part of the year depending on our view on 2026 cocoa levels. David Palmer : Thank you. Operator : We'll move next to Tom Palmer with Citi. Thomas Palmer : Hi. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask a little more on the expected cadence of both earnings and COGS inflation. And specifically on COGS inflation, it looks like 4Q24, we saw a bigger step-up. Will we then, I guess, thinking through 1Q to 3Q see a more normal rate and then inflation starts to ease based on current futures? And then, just given kind of the outsized earnings pressure in 1Q, might you then the main offset be 4Q? I just want to make sure we're kind of thinking through those moving pieces between cost and pricing over the course of the year. Luca Zaramella : Yeah. So, the pressure that you saw on profitability in Q4, it is the fact that cocoa was fairly high into our P&L in Q4. Your assumption should be that, that level of cocoa keeps until for the full 2025 at this level -- at this point in time, that's our assumption. So, I think you should assume that, that level of cocoa is equally spread throughout the remaining quarters of 2025. Now, the differential in terms of gating for profitability of 2025 is that we will have more pricing coming into the P&L. So, the elevated inflation is going to keep on hitting Q1, Q2, Q3. Obviously, Q4 will be different, because there is already elevated level of cocoa in the baseline. The difference is you're going to see sequential price improvement throughout the year, particularly as of Q2, Q3 and Q4, and that will provide benefits to the profitability of the company. Thomas Palmer : All right. Thanks for that. And just on the elasticity, you mentioned so far, that elasticity was 0.4. Just any color on what's embedded in guidance at this point? Thanks. Luca Zaramella : That is the guidance number. We have seen elasticities that are a little bit lower than that. We monitor elasticities very closely. I can tell you that in Q3 and Q4, the elasticities for chocolate that we saw was a little bit lower. The current planning assumption for 2025 is that elasticity on average is 0.4, 0.5 times. And that number is higher than what we have seen in 2024. Thomas Palmer : Okay. Thank you. Operator : We'll move next to Max Gumport with BNP Paribas. Max Gumport : Hey. Thanks for the question. You mentioned a number of times in this call that you have one of the highest supply chain productivity programs in your history coming up in '25. I was hoping you could just put a bit of a finer point on just how big that program might be? Thanks very much. Dirk Van De Put : Yeah. The typical targets that we have is about a 4% gross productivity on our supply chain. And then, depending on inflation rates and some other investments we might do, we try to translate that into a net productivity. In the past three, four years, it has been very difficult to reach that 4%, but we are planning to reach that in '25. So, that gives you an idea. Max Gumport : Great. Thanks very much. And then, turning back to North America and what you're seeing within your biscuit and cracker categories, and I understand your share performance is improving. Consumers still feeling some financial pressure in the U.S. I didn't hear you speak much to whether or not you think there is a shift away from snacking that's going on due to a consumer that's more focused on health and wellness or a consumer that's more and more likely to be on a GLP-1 drug. So, just curious on your view on the broader snacking category in the U.S. and whether or not there is some headwind to you to consider because of the shift to health and wellness? Thanks very much. Dirk Van De Put : Yes. Thank you. I would say, to our view at the moment, no, we do not necessarily see snacking diminishing because there is a shift to health and wellness, or there is a decreased consumption in snacking because of GLP-1s. We've monitored that very carefully, and so far, there is really no effect that we can tell. Within snacking, there might be a shift to more healthier products, but that has been going on for years. And I wouldn't say that in recent years, there has been a shift there. In fact, since COVID, the indulgent part in snacking is growing just as fast as the healthy part. So, that was different before COVID. So, if anything, the indulgent part remains as it was before. Max Gumport : Thanks very much. Operator : We'll now move to our final question from Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Peter Galbo : Hi. Good afternoon, Dirk and Luca. Thanks for the question. I'll keep it relatively short or to one question, but maybe with two parts. So, Luca, if I could just kind of hone in on the earnings per share, the actual guidance, roughly $2.90 for 2025. And with the clean numbers without JDE, you were $3.08 in '23 and $3.36 in '24. I guess the question, A, is 2023 probably the right high watermark to use from an earnings per share perspective just given this past year, you had some cost favorability at least through the first nine months relative to price relative to cocoa. And so, as we're thinking about growing off that $2.90 base over whatever timeframe, right, '23 is maybe a better high watermark. And then, the second part of that is just, like, what is the path back to that? Do you -- can you get to that high watermark with cocoa where it is currently? Does that need to come down, obviously to hit the number? I'm not looking to put a timeframe around it, but just if you can kind of unpack what the path back to that is would be helpful. Thanks very much. Luca Zaramella : So, just to be clear, it is not that cocoa in '24 is lower than 2023. It is that cocoa was higher and we priced somewhat to replacement cost in the first part of the year, and we have been taking advantage of the favorable pipeline compared to market, not compared to 2023. So, arguably the base EPS might be what you saw in the first three quarters of the year, provided that cocoa comes down to the levels of the first three years and that we hold on to the pricing that we have implemented. So, if you're trying to understand by when we can be back on track with the reasonable level of EPS, I think the question really becomes at what level of pricing are we going to be priced, particularly in 2026, and what level of cocoa are we going to have into the base P&L of 2026. What I wanted to say, particularly in the previous answers and in the prepared remarks is that, either way, we are committing to an EPS growth in 2026. If cocoa comes down in 2027 or in 2026, the earning upside potential that we have will put us back to levels that most likely you saw in the first few quarters of 2024. Again, I don't know if cocoa will come down at all, and that's where our commitment to you is that EPS will grow in 2026 and that's where we are telling you that regardless of the level of cocoa, there are two options here. Either we price more and we will get there, or if cocoa retrenches and comes down, the earnings power is within our P&L. Peter Galbo : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : I will now turn the conference back to Mr. Dirk Van De Put for any additional or closing remarks. Dirk Van De Put : Yes. Well, thank you very much. Thank you for attending this call. Looking forward to update you at the end of the first quarter when I assume that we will have a much clearer look already at how cocoa is evolving and how the pricing is landing in the markets. And until then, obviously, we are always available to answer any of your questions. Thank you. Luca Zaramella : Thank you, everyone. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",
