Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S. Operator : Hello, and welcome to the NetApp First Quarter Fiscal Year 2014 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Mayisha. I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kris Newton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Kris, you may begin. Kris Newton : Hello, and thank you for joining us. With me on today's call are our CEO, Tom Georgens; and our CFO, Nick Noviello. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com, along with the earnings release, our financial tables and the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation. Financial information previously found in the supplemental commentary document will now be included in the accompanying supplemental data tables of the quarterly financial press release. Additionally, a historical supplemental data table providing historical multi-period financial information will be available on our website. As a reminder, during today's call we will make forward-looking statements with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, all of which involve risks and uncertainty. Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons. We describe some of these reasons in our accompanying press release, which we have furnished to the SEC on an 8-K. A detailed discussion of these reasons is included in our risk factors in our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Q reports, also on file with the SEC and available on our website, all of which are incorporated by reference in today's discussion.

In a moment, Nick will walk you through some additional color on our financial results and then Tom will walk you through his perspective on the business this quarter. I'll now turn the call over to Nick. Nicholas R. Noviello: Thank you, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Q1 was another quarter of consistent execution and solid financial performance. Revenue of $1.52 billion was up 5% year-over-year and roughly at the midpoint of our guidance range despite some sequential FX headwinds and a continued uncertain macro environment. As we anticipated, year-over-year branded revenue growth was very strong, partially offset by further reductions in OEM revenue. Branded revenue was $1.35 billion, up 9% year-over-year, representing the largest increase in branded business in 7 quarters. OEM revenue continued to decline, down 20% on a year-over-year basis. Consistent with our expectations, we anticipate that OEM revenue will continue to decline on a year-over-year basis in Q2 and then normalize to the level we expected when we acquired Engenio. Indirect revenues remained strong, with 80% of Q1 revenue coming through the channels and OEMs. Arrow and Avnet contributed 21% and 16% of our total revenue, respectively. From a geographic perspective, Americas grew 7%, EMEA grew 2% and Asia Pacific grew 3% on a year-over-year basis. Within the Americas, commercial was up almost 8% and public sector was up 5% year-over-year. Non-GAAP gross margin of 61.3% was in line with Q4 and consistent with our Q1 and full year expectations. Non-GAAP product gross margin of 53.3% was up almost 2 points and service gross margin of 59.5% was relatively flat year-over-year. As we discussed on our call at the end of May, early in Q1, we took action to better align our investments and resources to our biggest opportunities, resulting in a headcount reduction of approximately 7% from our Q4 exit and a GAAP restructuring charge of approximately $48 million. Our non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 14.9%, over 2 points better than last year and up 1 point from our previous guidance, reflecting the benefits from our realignment activities net of new strategic investments across the business. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.53 grew 26% year-over-year. We derived $0.01 of benefit from our slightly lower-than-anticipated tax rate of 16.6% and $0.01 from our Q1 share repurchase activities. Excluding this net $0.02 benefit, non-GAAP EPS came in $0.01 above the high end of our previous guidance range. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.1 billion in cash and investments. Days sales outstanding of 32 and inventory at 20 turns reflect seasonal improvement and strong operational performance. Deferred revenue decreased from Q4 by $68 million to approximately $2.9 billion. However, on a year-over-year basis, deferred revenue was up $174 million. Cash from operations was approximately $286 million, an increase of 25% from Q1 of last year and free cash flow was 14.5% of revenue. Q1 is seasonally slow with respect to cash flows as cash generation is offset by payments of Q4 commissions and prior-year annual incentive compensation. On our call last quarter, we outlined important enhancements to our capital allocation strategy, including a $3 billion share repurchase program over 3 years and the initiation of a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share of common stock. These actions not only demonstrate our confidence in the underlying long-term strength of NetApp's business, but also our commitment to generating value for our shareholders. Consistent with our expectations, we returned just over $900 million to shareholders in Q1, which included approximately $850 million in share repurchases as well as approximately $51 million in our first cash dividend. We remain on track to achieve $1 billion in share repurchases by this September and today, we have also announced our next cash dividend of $0.15 per share of the company's stock to be paid on October 25. As expected, we retired our convertible notes in June with $1.265 billion of U.S. cash payments and the issuance of just under 1 million shares of common stock related to the excess of the average share price over the conversion price of $31.85, net of note hedges. Q1 diluted share count decreased by approximately 8 million shares from Q4, primarily related to stock repurchases as well as option and RSU activities. Separately, the warrants associated with our now retired convertible notes will become exercisable in September and October and will create dilution if our share price is over $41.12 during this time frame. Our warrants are not hedged. Turning to guidance. Our target revenue range for Q2 is $1.56 billion to $1.66 billion which, at the midpoint, implies about a 6% sequential growth and about 5% year-over-year growth. We expect year-over-year branded revenue growth at similar levels to Q1, implying a better-than-normal seasonal growth rate but a continued decline in OEM revenue. We expect consolidated non-GAAP gross margins of approximately 61% and non-GAAP operating margins of 16% to 16.5%, increasing over 1 point sequentially and up to 2 points over Q2 last year. We expect our blended consolidated non-GAAP effective tax rate to remain at Q1 levels and then increase in the back half of the fiscal year. Based on our average stock price of $41.56 for the first 10 days of the quarter, we expect our diluted share count for Q2 to decrease to approximately 351 million shares. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share for Q2 to range from approximately $0.60 to $0.65 per share, up 18% to 27% from Q2 last year. The midpoint of our EPS range implies mid-teens growth in EPS from operations alone versus Q2 of last year. As we move into the second quarter, our expectations for fiscal 2014 remain unchanged. Though ultimately dependent on revenue mix and growth, we are reiterating our expectation for approximately 61% gross margin and approximately 17% operating margin for the year. We continue to expect full year EPS growth in the mid-teens from operations and further supplemented by our capital allocation activities. We are on track to complete our plan of repurchasing $2 billion of stock in the 12-month period following our Q4 announcement, $1 billion of which will be completed by this September. Our cash-generating capacity remains intact and strong. At this point, I will turn the call over to Tom for his thoughts. Tom? Thomas Georgens : Thanks, Nick, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased that despite the macro uncertainties and constrained IT spending environment, the NetApp team delivered solid Q1 results. As Nick described, revenue came in near the midpoint of our guidance and EPS was over the top of the range. Gross margin improved from Q1 a year ago and was in line with our guidance. Most notably, we delivered strong branded revenue growth of 9% year-over-year. This strong growth builds on the momentum that we saw in the second half of fiscal year '13 and, as Nick noted, we expect a similar level of branded growth again in Q2. The strength of our branded business reflects a tremendous value we are delivering to our customers today and their confidence in our long-term strategy to help them navigate the future. Data ONTAP, the #1 market share storage operating system, enables enterprise-wide scalable data management and consistency of operations across private, public and hybrid clouds. In Q1, we introduced Data ONTAP 8.2, building on the strong ONTAP foundation. ONTAP 8.2 improves quality of service and nondisruptive operations and includes enhanced migration tools. At the core of ONTAP are storage virtual machines that support customers' software-defined initiatives by enabling them to partition shared resources securely and with quality of service across the cluster and automate provisioning to individual applications. Data ONTAP 8.2 has had the fastest adoption rate of any of our major releases and, overall, almost 60% of our entire installed base has moved to ONTAP 8. Clustered ONTAP also continues to see strong customer interest and sales momentum. Clustered nodes are up more than 400% from Q1 a year ago. In Q1, clustered ONTAP revenue again reached the highest ever percentage of total revenue. The majority of clustered ONTAP systems are going to customers new to NetApp or new applications within existing customers. In either case, we are expanding our addressable market and solidifying our position in an increasing number of accounts. We also saw strong momentum with our flash solutions. NetApp offers the broadest and most complete flash portfolio in the industry. Over 60% of FAS systems are shipped with Flash Cache and/or Flash Pool. Flash Pool sales increased almost 50% from Q1 last year. Flash Accel, which began shipping this quarter, will combine application integration and enterprise data management with the performance capabilities of flash to finally enable the full potential of server-side flash. On the all-flash array front, we have now shipped over 300 units of our recently announced EF540. The majority of EF540 units are in database acceleration deployments. Overall, in less than a year, NetApp has moved from the perception of not participating in the flash market to a leadership position. In addition to the strong growth of the all-flash EF540, we are seeing accelerating growth of the total E-Series family. The technology agenda for E-Series is now driven by our branded solutions. We have an unambiguous position that clustered ONTAP is the premier solution for shared infrastructure and business applications. But there is also a set of workloads with a different set of requirements around performance, density and capacity that are driving extremely large data sets, which is where E-Series fits in. The breadth of workload and customers for our branded E-Series solutions continues to expand and we are pleased with the progress we are now seeing in this product line. We expect that in aggregate, E-Series, both branded and OEM combined, will be a growing business in fiscal year '15. This quarter, every FAS platform showed year-over-year growth in both units and dollars. Of particular note was the FAS6000 family, units of which grew 28% from Q1 a year ago. Additionally, we saw capacity shipments grow 16% year-over-year. Our business model includes a strong partner ecosystem that drives customer success. Through our alliance partners and our reselling channel partners, we are delivering a complete innovation stack based on best-of-breed technology to our customers. A key proof point of this model is FlexPod, the industry's #1 converged infrastructure solution. FlexPod systems sold increased 30% year-over-year and the number of new FlexPod customers is up 22% from Q1 a year ago. NetApp and Cisco have expanded the program with FlexPod Select based on the E-Series architecture for dedicated high-performance workloads such as big data, high-performance computing and video analytics. We further enhanced our partnership with Citrix through the integration of clustered Data ONTAP with Citrix for desktop and application virtualization, mobile collaboration and cloud services. We were pleased to be named Microsoft's Server Platform Partner of the Year for our innovative storage solutions that enable nondisruptive operation and deliver optimal operational efficiency for virtualized environments and cloud services. In addition, we expanded our alliance partnership with Microsoft to accelerate the adoption of enterprise cloud systems. I said earlier that our strong branded revenue growth stems from the value we are delivering to customers today and their confidence in our ability to help them navigate the future. Let me elaborate. We are leading in technology across the big trends that are shaping the industry today : mobility, big data, flash, software-defined and cloud. In Q1, we introduced NetApp Connect, which delivers mobile access to corporate data while maintaining the tight security and control that enterprise IT requires by keeping its data and business protected. With our ability to unify structured and unstructured data into a single infrastructure, we are unmatched in our ability to manage the breadth of enterprise data at scale. Our breadth and adoption rate of flash technology has been a big contributor to our recent performance and our cloud and software-defined strategies are unique in the industry. As CIOs look to optimize business outcomes for their enterprises, there are more options available than ever before. Emerging storage technologies such as flash and deployment models like converged infrastructures are impacting on-premise computing. NetApp has leadership positions in both. In addition, customers have alternate off-premise IT delivered models available to them as well. Enterprise customers will deploy some hybrid combination of all of these models. However, regardless of the ultimate computing destination, the CIO will maintain responsibility for data stewardship. The introduction of the cloud makes data governance even more complex because data is distributed and not under direct control. NetApp's vision is to create an enterprise data management solution that will span the customer's data storage landscape regardless of data type or location. We have our integrated FAS storage systems. With V-Series, we can manage other vendor storage devices. With Flash Accel, we can manage flash in the servers. ONTAP in a virtual machine and NetApp Private Storage for Amazon Web Services are technologies that enable management of data in the cloud. We believe that these capabilities and the future options that they create uniquely enable NetApp to deliver the vision of a unified multi-platform distributed enterprise data management solution. This is the epitome of software-defined and a more expansive vision than we've seen presented by anyone to date. More importantly, much of it is available now, enabling customers to choose NetApp today with the confidence in our ability to meet their future requirements. When I look at the evolution of clustered Data ONTAP, our broad flash portfolio, the growth of our E-Series branded solutions and the work we are doing around NetApp Connect and NetApp Private Storage for Amazon Web Services and storage grid, I see that we have more technology at the early stages of its product life cycle today than at any time in our history. We believe we have more as yet unrealized potential out of this portfolio than ever before. Because of this, I remain confident in our ability to outgrow the market and gain share, not only today, but tomorrow as well. Finally, I would like to thank the more than 12,000 NetApp employees for maintaining focus in the face of an uncertain macro environment and our recent realignment to deliver a solid quarter. All of your hard work across all aspects of the business is coming to fruition and we are seeing that in our results. At this point, I will open up the call for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Shelby Seyrafi (sic) [Shebly Seyrafi] with FBN Securities. Shebly Seyrafi - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division : Can you talk about the product gross margin? It was up year-to-year, but it declined about 200 basis points sequentially. My checks indicate there's competition from IBM and EMC. So if you can elaborate on that. Nicholas R. Noviello: Sure, Shebly. Nick Noviello here. So let me just reiterate the numbers that you're referring to. So product gross margin in the fourth quarter was 55.8% and in the first quarter was at 53.3%. Frankly, we typically see a decline in product gross margin in the business. The other thing that you need to keep in mind as you look at the sequential and what happens on the seasonality here is that you're going to end up with a mix of business that's a little different because the branded business is going to be the one that is sequentially down. And what you see on a sequential basis is that the OEM side of the fence was relatively unchanged, so there's going to be a mix impact as well. So we really have to look at a combination of mix of business, right, branded versus OEM. We look at the seasonal that happens anyway from Q4 to Q1 and we look at a variety of other components here. There is nothing that I would say that's abnormal in discounting or competitive that's showing up in these numbers. They're all pretty consistent. Shebly Seyrafi - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division : Nick, if I can follow through. Do you expect the gross -- product gross margin to return to like high 55s, 55% to 56% by the end of the year or over the next 1.5 years? Nicholas R. Noviello: So what I would say there, first of all, so we gave you the guidance for Q2, Q2 guidance, approximately 61% on gross margin. Again, if you look at the seasonal over time, we generally have a higher gross margin on the product side in the second quarter. I would expect that to come through again. So we would see an increase in product gross margin there and, over time, we expect an increasing product gross margin. Operator : Our next question is Aaron Rakers with Stifel, Nicolaus. Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : Tom, last quarter, you had talked pretty candidly about what you were seeing in terms of bookings, in particular, branded bookings. I think you had said double-digit growth year-over-year. Can you update us on what you saw in the July quarter from that perspective and then just kind of dovetailing that with linearity in the quarter? Thomas Georgens : Well, I think we stay away from bookings. It's not a -- we need to be careful of the definition there and it's not an auditable number. So we don't disclose bookings for the company. But I think as the quarter plays out, 9% branded growth is pretty strong. The fact that we're forecasting 9% or so branded growth again next quarter would indicate that we clearly have ongoing momentum in that area. So it certainly wasn't a one-off thing. And we see it across the board. Clearly, the clustered ONTAP uptake is key here. I think that the flash story, the all-flash array around the E-Series has been very, very powerful. I think we're very, very pleased with the momentum that we see there. So as far as I look at it, I think -- if I just took actually a bigger step back, I'd say the first half of last year, we were in a pretty big product transition around clustered ONTAP and we certainly saw the growth rate. And then we saw momentum build and market share gain in the second half of the year. I think we finished strong and I think we started this year relatively strong in this market. So I should think that we built some momentum last year. We talked about it in Q4. And I think it continues and it's reflected in our forecast for our branded business next quarter. Operator : Our next question is Kulbinder Garcha with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : The question is for Tom. Tom, with the pickup in revenue growth you're seeing last quarter, this quarter and what you're guiding for in the branded business, I'm kind of curious as to what you think is happening to the end market storage and your market share, just in terms of you're obviously probably gaining and probably gaining again in the mid end as well. Can you speak about some of the competitive dynamics? And are you getting any signs that with this pickup in revenue growth, that just the end market environment at least for the storage segment, it seems to be proving not only resilient, but maybe reaccelerating as you head into the second half of the calendar year? Thomas Georgens : Well, I think we can -- we need to focus on what we see and where we're winning. If I look at 9% branded growth, that's really the component that drives the market share number. I don't see anybody close to that number. So I think unquestionably, this is a pretty strong market share quarter for us, I think that goes without saying. I want to be careful about the industry at large. If I look at recent announcements, EMC storage business, a bit over 3.5%. I think Hitachi reported 1%. IBM was down and we'll see what HP and Dell report. But overall, I think that unquestionably, the demand for the products in our suite is clearly stronger than it certainly was a year ago. So I think we feel better about it. But I wouldn't go so far as to say that we've got an economic tailwind driving us. I think NetApp, the competitive position is stronger than it's been and I think we're making the most of it. So I think unquestionably, we're gaining share. That said, certainly, we saw a little bit better economic news in terms of GDP growth out of the EU reported this morning. And I think things probably feel a little bit better than they were a year ago, but I wouldn't use the word dramatic turnaround or anything like that. And certainly, as we think about our guidance, on the federal side, that's an important part of our business, we have the sequester component that's out there. I think we've had the sequester all year and NetApp has done very, very well there. I expect that to continue up until the end of the government fiscal year. But our quarter also includes October, which is the first month of the next fiscal year. And I think there's a little bit of concern about what it's actually going to play out there. So I'm not worried about anything NetApp specific on that front, but clearly, that's going to be a politicized process. But between now and the end of the government fiscal year, I expect us to continue to take our own fair share of the government business. Operator : Next question is Kathryn Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Kathryn L. Huberty - Morgan Stanley, Research Division : I think somebody asked about linearity, but I'm not sure you specifically commented. Did you see an improvement in demand or just uptake in NetApp products as you move through the months of the quarter? And Nick, maybe you can comment on why DSOs came down so much and whether that speaks to linearity in the quarter. Thomas Georgens : I would say that in general, the quarter was pretty typical. We also had kind of a NetApp-induced wrinkle this quarter is that we were doing the realignment and the restructuring this quarter. And clearly, that had the potential of having a big impact on our sales organization. We've certainly seen that to be disruptive to companies in the past and I think we've managed through that. But I think that, that probably had some impact on the timing. So I think there's probably a little bit of an anomaly. But I wouldn't say that we were any more back-end loaded or any more back-end coasting in than any quarters in the past. So I think it kind of played out the way we would've thought, but we did have a little bit of disruption in the middle as we, basically, realigned territories and reassigned quotas and did all things associated with the restructuring. Nicholas R. Noviello: Yes. And Katy, just in terms of the DSO, yes, it was 37 in Q1 last year and down to 32, but we think -- we've seen 32 before. And I actually think there's a little bit here around all of the integration activities around Engenio are completely behind us. You see inventory turns up as well. I think there's a normalization there of that type of integration behind us. And then just strong execution across the board. And we're really pushing on that execution, I think, as that came through. Thomas Georgens : Yes, I mean, the one thing I'd add on the execution front, this will be a message to employees tomorrow, is the DSO number was one of the best we've ever reported. The inventory turns number was one of the best we've ever reported, certainly the best since the Engenio acquisition. Gross margin is strong. We had the realignment and all of that. We didn't lose any sales momentum, at least not in the aggregate for the quarter. We also moved a factory in Europe last quarter without disruption to the business. So I think we've clearly upped the intensity around execution. And I think that all in all, we're pretty pleased about how this quarter came down. Operator : Our next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Just a question on gross margins. Could you maybe talk about why do you guys see gross margins being flat in the October quarter guide, given the fact that sales are actually going to go up sequentially by about 6%? I imagine that mix will actually get more favorable as branded continues to grow for you. So maybe somewhat, what are the headwinds that I might be missing that are limiting gross margin uptick in the quarter? Nicholas R. Noviello: Yes, so Amit, this is Nick. So let me walk through a couple of pieces. So I indicated that we would have -- we talked about the branded growth and that the branded mix will improve a little bit in the second quarter from the first quarter. Obviously, with that, that carries a higher margin base. The product gross margin, as I indicated to Shebly earlier, I would expect to go up from Q1 to Q2 or a sequential increase there. However, on the service side of the fence, the first quarter of the year is generally a higher or a high-water mark for the service side. Because a lot of the bookings come through in actual revenue in Q1, yet the costs are linear across the period of time. So in terms of services investments, I think you'll see and we will experience more services investments in the second quarter. That will impact the service gross margin and take that down. The blend is the approximate 61% we guided you to. Operator : Our next question is from Maynard Um with Wells Fargo. Maynard Joseph Um - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : I just want to touch a little bit more about the competitive landscape. I mean, it clearly sounds like you're still seeing good wins across the board. But I'm wondering if you've seen any changes within the competitive landscape, whether from the traditional vendors, the channel, or whether you're seeing more and more of the new entrants. Regardless of whether or not they're winning and you're winning the business, I'm just wondering if you've seen any changes in that competitive landscape. Thomas Georgens : I'd say not a lot. Clearly, if I look at our portfolio with clustered ONTAP being mainstreamed and the flash momentum, I think we're probably better armed than we were a year ago and certainly more confident than we were a year ago. But I think the dynamics clearly are the independent players continuing to gain share, continuing to be more relevant and the service -- and the servers vendors continuing to decline in relevance. So I think clearly, whether we're competing though for the footprint of a server vendor or legacy server vendor installed base, we're typically competing with EMC to get that, whether EMC is the incumbent or not. So clearly, that's where the competitive intensity is the greatest and really across the board. Perhaps a little bit more with EMC, certainly, what we come out then with the value proposition of clustered ONTAP. We typically, EMC, go down the Isilon path or the V-Max path to try and match up a little bit differently rather than try to take us out with some of their traditional offerings. So I'd say that if there's one dynamic is we're probably seeing a lot more V-Max engagement. And I think that's really the clustered ONTAP lining up against VNX and EMC will go to V-Max instead to compete. That's probably the only thing that I see different. I mean, you certainly see small guys. But at the end of the day, the competitive intensity with EMC is in a large percentage of the transactions that we see. Operator : Our next question is Ben Reitzes with Barclays. Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Tom, when I look at your results -- and I'm hopping between some conference calls tonight, but it looks like the big difference is APAC maybe versus the Street. I was wondering, you might have -- you probably touched on it in your remarks, but if you could just talk a little bit there, if the U.S. looks actually pretty strong versus expectations, Europe in line and it looked like APAC was light. So obviously, that economy is pretty weak, but how do you see that playing out and when can that rebound? Because we've -- looking at this, it looks like you probably beat everybody's expectations in the U.S. Thomas Georgens : Yes, I'd say probably one wrinkle in that story a little bit is that the thing that we look for in terms of our measurements, really, is bookings. And here's the case where the bookings performance and the revenue performance are a little bit distorted. So our bookings performance in APAC was actually a bit different. If I look at APAC, areas where we saw strength this quarter is Japan has been strong for us for several years now. That's really been a very, very strong management leadership story by the NetApp leadership over there. China had a very, very strong booking quarter, in the vicinity of just under 40%. But we also saw some weakness on the Australia side at the ANZ area. So I'd say it's somewhat uneven. Japan and China and then Korea is much, much smaller but has pretty good growth. But I'd say that ANZ, the Asian [ph] area and India are not as strong. But overall, I'd say from a booking perspective, the numbers are a little bit better than shipments. That's primarily a timing issue. So clearly, it's not at the growth rate we were probably 6 months ago. That's a fact, but still pretty good. And it's, from a booking perspective, higher than all the other areas. Operator : Our next question is from Rajesh Ghai with Craig-Hallum. Rajesh Ghai - Craig-Hallum Capital Group LLC, Research Division : Tom, you mentioned that the Cluster-Mode was getting you into new workloads. And also, you're effectively competing against V-Max more than you had done in the past. I was wondering if you could talk about what those incremental workloads were and what -- how much of an incremental time are you addressing as a result of the Cluster-Mode now? Thomas Georgens : Well, when I look at clustered ONTAP and the ability to take the feature set of Data ONTAP, which is the #1 operating system in the world from a storage perspective, and basically marry that with cluster and we can deliver really unlimited scale, unlimited performance and nondisruptive operation. So in our core markets, large-scale file services and content, clearly that's been a big market for us and this will allow us to scale even bigger. Virtualization, clearly a big play. We've established a big footprint. This will allow us more mission-critical nondisruptive operation, allow the virtualization of more applications that I think serves us well in our partnership with VMware and also expands our segment there. And I think that's pretty well understood. That, I think, is competitive as an existing segment. The other thing is going deeper in the data center, perhaps with some applications that might not have considered NetApp in the past. Database would certainly fall into that. Decision-support applications, things of that nature. And that's a big part of the business. Deeper in the data center, more mission-critical apps, now with the nondisruptive operation, the scale and the performance, they can offer a solution that can scale and perform better than any individual box from anybody and that's a TAM expansion component for us. And frankly, it's one of the biggest untapped, proven profit pools in the entire industry. So from our perspective, file services, virtualization, that's stronger where we previously played. But here's the opportunity to go deeper after more mission-critical applications in the data center, proven profit pool, and I'd say that's a big opportunity for us in terms of TAM expansion. And for clustered ONTAP, it's specific. That's probably the biggest TAM expansion opportunity we have. Operator : Our next question is Jayson Noland with Robert Baird. Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Tom, I wanted to ask about pent-up demand for 8.2 and 8.3. We talked about that in the channel. And then at the same time, if you could address the migration to clustered ONTAP, how difficult is it, what role does the channel play? Do you have services in-house now that are -- that makes that process a little easier? Thomas Georgens : Well, we've just introduced 8.2. And one of the things about the clustered ONTAP story for us, one of the things as we compete with this technology and move into the new technology, requires the migration of the data. And that takes time, it requires scheduling and a bunch of other things. So one of the things that we have with 8.1 is -- and we've talked about it in the past, is it doesn't have 100% feature compatibility with the 7 mode before it. So for some customers, before they migrate, they want to make sure their business processes can transfer seamlessly to the new software. So interesting is for all the momentum that we've seen up until the release of 8.2, it's primarily not come from merely repositioning our existing product base or existing customer base. But it's actually come from brand-new accounts and brand-new workloads, which actually have the team pretty excited because that basically says that the value proposition is strong because we can beat the competition with it. But the real migration of our existing footprint, that has really only just begun. So with 8.2, we closed a substantial amount of the feature gaps where a substantial amount of our installed base can now move seamlessly to the new platform, but they physically have to migrate the data in order to do it. And with 8.2 comes a set of migration tools that will help them with that process. So -- and kind of my internal joke is that, so far, that it's proven to be easy to compete against the competition with clustered ONTAP than it is to compete against ourselves. But now with the feature parity mostly achieved, the opportunity to move more and more customers. And that's probably going to be a big part of our activity over the 6 months. But that's not just the pent-up demand. That doesn't happen overnight. It takes finite time to move. It's something that needs to be scheduled. It's something that the customers need to plan. But I expect it to be a relatively significant activity over the rest of this fiscal year now that we've got 8.2 out. So my summary is that most of what we've done so far, despite all the growth with thousands of machines and everything and all the progress that we've made, that's really been the hard growth of basically new wins and new workloads. And just the conversion of the existing installed base, I'd say that we're in the early days of that. Operator : Our next question is Steve Milunovich with UBS. Steven Milunovich - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : You gave some numbers on the series 6000. Can you give similar numbers on the 2000 and the 3000? And also, do you contemplate much impact from the VNX upgrade that's likely to come in the market over the next 2 quarters? Thomas Georgens : Well, while they're looking up the other numbers, I'd say one of the things that was notable is that all platforms, 2000, 3000 and 6000, were all up year-over-year. It's been a long time since I've said that. So that's all pretty good. 6000 is particularly strong. In terms of VNX, I think at the end of the day, platform refreshes don't fundamentally change the competitive basis. I mean, that's kind of an arms race. Customers see that going on. Unless you're basically creating a new architecture, entering a new space, I'm not quite sure that that's a game changer. The real decision point to choose NetApp regardless of the platform that they run on is really the software value proposition. And as I see EMC with VNX today faced with the clustered ONTAP value proposition, I see them move a lot more towards Isilon and V-Max and not take those 2 products head-to-head. So I guess from my take is unless we see a significant expansion of the software portfolio associated with VNX, I really don't expect it to change the competitive landscape that much. Okay. On the units. Okay. I got a -- let me see what I can read off to you. So in terms of units, 6000 was 1,471. 3000 was 4,743. 2000 was 10,040. Revenue for the 6... Nicholas R. Noviello: That's it. Thomas Georgens : That's it. I guess that's enough. But basically up on revenue -- I'd say pretty much up on revenue, up on units by roughly the same percentage. Operator : Our next question is Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan. Mark A. Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : I wanted to follow up, if I could, on the total deferred revenue. It's only declined sequentially a couple times in the past 4 years. Just kind of curious if there are any sort of puts and takes we should walk away with related to that quarterly change here. Was there any change in relation to bookings conversion rates or just in terms of the quality of the revenue mix? Kind of curious what are the dynamics there if there were. Nicholas R. Noviello: Sure. Mark, it's Nick. So let me walk you through that. So we had a decline in deferred revenue in Q4 of last -- sorry, Q1 of last year as well when we went from Q4 into Q1. So this has happened before. And I think what you really need to look at is the decline and the sequential decline from Q4 to Q1 in branded business because that's where we have a deferred revenue component, right? So when we look at the OEM, by the way, there's virtually no deferred component, if any. So this is really all about the sequential reduction in branded revenue from quarter-to-quarter. And when you have a sequential reduction of the sizes we're talking about, there's going to be an impact on deferred revenue as well. And deferred revenue is simply you can think about it as thousands and thousands of contracts that amortize over periods of time. That's a $3 billion balance on the balance sheet, right? And every quarter, we are adding new contracts to it and subtracting and amortizing off older contracts or recognizing revenue for older contracts. And it's really just a matter of what goes in versus what goes out. And when you have a sequential decline at the level you did this quarter from Q4 to Q1, which we expected, and you had a sequential decline from Q4 of FY '12 into Q1 of FY '13 like we did, you're going to have that reduction. Mark A. Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : But it was still up year-over-year? Nicholas R. Noviello: Yes, still up year-over-year. So I wouldn't get beyond -- too much beyond this is a timing thing and this is really what happens with that sequential type of decline in branded revenue. Operator : Next question is from Louis Miscioscia with CLSA. Louis R. Miscioscia - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division : Tom, you mentioned that things don't really change unless there's a big architectural shift on the normal refresh. So with a lot coming out in the flash area, what's your view about whether you think flash is going to change the industry, maybe not over the next couple of months, but maybe over the next couple of years? Obviously, main cost might be more. But then again, when we take space, power cooling efficiency and it does get pretty attractive and for you all to really have to wait until your flash raise [ph] out before you could start pushing harder? Thomas Georgens : Frankly, we're pushing hard pretty now -- pretty hard now. And I think the EF540 story is we're quite pleased with that. With 300 machines in a relatively short period of time, I don't know how many people have shipped more than that, but it can't be many, if any. So I think we've been quite pleased with that momentum. I think that, certainly, the market will evolve over time. Where we are today, I think the unquestioned prove and use case is basically raw performance married with high availability. And I think that's really the strength of the EF540. It's got a long history of performance-based architecture and it's got a long history of proven high availability and I think that's really what's driving it. I think the use case for more rich functionality and persistent stores, I think that use case is still evolving. And I think that part of it is the maturity of the technology; part of it is, is the economics. When I take flash and kind of distill it down to its core premise is flash, on a capacity basis, is more expensive than disk. But from an I/O per second, it's actually a lot less expensive than disk. So the task at hand abstracting any individual technology is how do you get the random I/O workload on flash and how do you get everything else on raw drives. And that's really the essence of the problem here. So the data placement component of this matters a lot. So the argument -- and what that also means is that you can't afford to have idle data on flash. And frankly, I think the argument that flash is cheaper on the total cost of ownership basis than disk, particularly SATA disk, that argument doesn't wash. I don't see customers buying that. I don't see the trend favorable in that dimension either. So I think it's still going to be the case where flash is more expensive and, therefore, data placement is going to be critical. So as we think about the functionality of individual flash arrays and all the stuff that we're working on in FlashRay, I think that matters. But I also believe that managing the data placement across a multimedia storage hierarchy, some flash, some disk, some tape or some cloud, that, that problem has to get solved and that is just as important. And I think that's really where ONTAP gives us a key long-term advantage. So in addition to the FlashRay technology, being able to integrate that into a unified enterprise-wide data management framework like ONTAP, I think it's a really, really key advantage for us in the long run. So how do I see flash? I see flash as part of a data storage hierarchy. And the data placement, how the data resides on the most cost-effective, performance optimized component at any point in time, that is ultimately going to be the intellectual property that's going to drive this to be a mainstream technology. Operator : Our next question is Brian Alexander with Raymond James. Brian G. Alexander - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Tom, back to the strength in clustered ONTAP, if you can give us an update on the installed base penetration that you have there in both the mid range and the high end? I think last quarter was around 18%. And where do you think that penetration can be in a year with 8.2 introduced out in the marketplace given the opportunity you mentioned before with your existing base? Thomas Georgens : Well, I think overall, what we saw in the quarter, obviously, with the Q4 to Q1 seasonality, we didn't see a sequential increase like we saw in the past. But as a percentage of total revenue, it's the highest it's ever been. We saw with the 6000s, it was probably roughly comparable to last quarter, a bit less than 30%. And what we did see this quarter is actually a pickup in connect rates with the 3000s. So that's probably saying that's a little bit different now. 2000 connect rates are a bit lower. Although with 8.2, there's some functionality that makes that more cost-effective and we expect to see some activity there. In terms of where does it want to go, that's kind of a tough call overall. Obviously, it will be a function of the rate at which customers in their own operations want to do the migration. Clearly, we see internally, at least in the 3000s and the 6000s, we want to see the tipping point of 50%. That's kind of the number that we're driving for. So I'm not going to disclose a time frame on that. But as far as we're concerned, that's the metric that we're driving is where do we get -- when do we get those to 50%. So that's clearly within our planning horizon and that's what we're driving for. Operator : Our next question is Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs. Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Looking at the savings you've captured from the restructuring so far, can you remind us what portion of that's going to be reinvested in the business versus falling to the bottom line and the timing of that reinvestment throughout the fiscal year? And I guess if you could also remind us how -- where you're focusing that. Nicholas R. Noviello: Yes, Bill, it's Nick. So we realized in the quarter a little over $20 million of savings from the realignment action that we did. And recall that, that realignment action was really about making sure that our investments were pointed at the biggest return, right? And what we indicated at the time that built into our approximate 17% operating margin and operating profit margin guidance for the year was not only the takeout of the set of costs, but the reinvestment of the set of costs across a number of initiatives, clustered Data ONTAP being one of them, flash being another. Those are the types of things that we're pointing those investments to. And we talked about the fact that, that would happen over the course of the year. In Q1, you're not going to see a lot of that. It's going to be slower in Q1 because you're still, in part, this process took most of the quarter to execute. A lot of it in the U.S., done pretty much immediately. Some of it, places around the world, it takes longer. So we are in the reinvestment mode. I'm going to ask if you all can still hear as well. Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Yes, I can still hear you. Nicholas R. Noviello: Okay. I'm getting feedback here on the phone. So we are in the reinvestment mode. That reinvestment is planned over the remaining quarters of the year. It's built into our guidance as we give guidance each quarter and it's built into our guidance for the full year of approximately 17% operating margin. Frankly, it is also a lever. And if we, over the course of the year, determine that for macro reasons or other reasons we're not going to see the type of profitability we expect, we'll pull that lever. But at this point in time, our view on the year is absolutely intact, our view on the quarter is intact and our view on the reinvestment is intact. Thomas Georgens : Yes, the one thing I'd -- just to reiterate a little bit is on the last call, we talked about shareholder return and our commitment to driving high single digits EPS -- actually, mid single digits EPS growth over the course of the year and the fact that we now have multiple avenues to get there, right? We certainly got the -- we can basically have the reinvestment lever to get there. We can slow that down if revenue doesn't materialize. We can also -- we actually have the capital reallocation plan. So there's a bunch in play and then, obviously, the [indiscernible] growth of the business. So I want to be clear. We said we'd be at kind of mid-teens and we're committed to that. And I think that even in an uncertain environment, between the recap, the reinvestment and the operation in the business, I see the multiple avenues of getting there. And that's why we're in a position to reiterate that number for the year. Operator : Our next question is from Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital. Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division : Maybe Tom and Nick, could you just give us, I guess, some sense of what goes into your buyback decisions, the pace of your buyback in the mosaic that you look at when you're kind of deciding? I guess going forward from this point, that you'll be looking at to balance out the pace of buyback decisions. Nicholas R. Noviello: Yes, so Ananda, this is Nick. Let me start off with that one and, certainly, Tom will add his point of view as well. So when we talked about this 90 -- 120 days ago and change, we talked about what we're planning for a 3-year period of time and then what we're planning for the first 12 months of that and the first 90 days -- actually, 120 days. So we indicated in the first 4 months, we buy $1 billion back, right? That first 4 months is basically through September. What you see is that in our first quarter, we bought $850 million of stock back. We did an ASR of $750 million, that's behind us. We did $50 million otherwise, that's behind us. So we've done absolutely what we've said, actually probably a little faster than linear, in this first quarter. I would expect that over the remainder of Q2 and probably pushed towards the front end of Q2, we will finish that $1 billion of repurchase. You also see on the dividend side, we did the $51 million in dividend in Q1. We'll do the same towards the end of Q2. To your point on the rest [ph], right, we indicated that in a 12-month period of time, so basically up until May of next calendar year, we will purchase another $1 billion. We will absolutely do that and we'll -- we have at our disposal, really, the timing of that. But we're going to be aware of all of those pieces and look at the timing. I think for Q2, I would say that we're going to first be focused on this first $1 billion of the $3 billion program. We're going to be focused on getting the warrants behind us. That's a September, October maturity on the warrants. And then we're going to be absolutely looking at the second $1 billion of the $3 billion program which we talked about for a 12-month period of time. And that 12 months really runs through May of next calendar year. Thomas Georgens : Yes, I think that's fair. And we'll give you visibility into what we're thinking there on the next call once we get through the September and October period. Operator : Our next question is Glenn Hanus with Needham & Company. Glenn Hanus - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division : So back on the E-Series and maybe you could give us some more color there. You're looking for that to stabilize or even grow in fiscal 2015, some color on application. You talked about a little bit, Tom, application, use cases there on the branded side. And then on the OEM side, will that stabilize somewhat? Or should that just continue to be a declining business for the foreseeable future? Thomas Georgens : Well, on the OEM side, I think we got 1 more quarter at least of decline. And that's what we're expecting, just 1 more quarter of decline and then I think we'll start to see it stabilize from there. And we'll also see, hopefully, some of the new wins in that space start to contribute or at least offset the decline. So I think clearly, at the end of the day, we're kind of where we thought we would be when we bought this business in the first place. We kind of took a circuitous route to get here. But clearly, we've seen 20% declines the last couple of quarters. And eventually, when we come one full circle, that will start to normalize. And in fact this quarter, from a booking perspective, absent one OEM, the rest of the business was actually up slightly for the first time in quite a while. So that was positive for us. The thing that probably took a little bit longer to come to fruition, really, is the momentum around the branded side. We expected that to offset the decline of the -- the expected decline of the OEM by now and that was a little slow in developing. But we've really seen some good momentum. In fact, the branded side was actually up sequentially from Q4 slightly. And unlike the rest of the branded business, kind of flip that off. So we're quite pleased with that. The EF family is -- it's clearly an important part of that, the all-flash array. We talked about the units that we shipped. But I should add that, that is less than half of the total E-Series bookings. So we're seeing E-Series go out in many of the areas that we thought. We're seeing in large storage repositories in media, in health care, oil and gas, high-performance computing-type applications. So we're starting to see the aperture open wider on that and we're starting to see a much, much broader acceptance of the technology. Early on, a lot of that business was centralized in a couple of geos, particularly U.S. public sector and to some extent, in the media space. But now we're starting to see it more broadly across the entire footprint of our installed base. We actually see a fair amount of momentum in Europe this past quarter. We had a relatively large program underway. So I think, overall, I'd say we're probably behind where we expected to be at this point on the branded side. But the ramp has actually been pretty strong and we feel pretty good about it. And that's why I made the comment earlier that in the aggregate, I expect the combined branded plus OEM business, that should be a growth business for NetApp in fiscal year '15. Operator : Our next question is Keith Bachman with Bank of Montr\u00e9al. Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Tom, I wanted to follow up from something earlier. You mentioned 8.2 might get into existing workloads. It's certainly consistent with what we've heard. It's been more about new workloads. Does that change your -- how should we be thinking about the mix impact from a customer perspective? Might customers migrate up, so to speak, in terms of their mix profile if 8.2 does get some adoption with existing workloads? Thomas Georgens : Migrate up... Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Maybe move from the high end -- or excuse me, high end of 2000 series to the low end of 3000 series. In other words, the requirements of 8.2 suggest that customers might need a bit more horsepower, so to speak. Thomas Georgens : There's certainly conflicting points of view on that. I think there's one conventional wisdom that says the high-end platforms are optimized for performance and the low-end platforms are optimized for cost and the mid range are optimized for price performance, so a balance. And therefore, with clustering technology, the best price performance alternative would be to actually cluster the mid-range products. And you have a debate as to whether we'll ever need another high-end platform again. And in my experience, not only here on this product but in other situations I've been, is that it doesn't always play out that way. It's that the early adopters are the ones that are most performance constraint and they're going to go to the biggest platforms and they're going to cluster those. And we've certainly seen that, at least in the early days. Perhaps now, with a little bit of tick up of clustered ONTAP connect rate on the 3000s, maybe we're starting to see that, that pieces play out a little bit. So I actually don't think that it will migrate to the larger platform. If anything, it might actually go the other way because you can build very, very, very large systems incrementally using more cost-effective building blocks. So and the net of it is, it's margin neutral to us. So in terms of modeling the business, I don't think it fundamentally changes anything. And that's part of the reason why we're somewhat -- we're not very, very emphatic about going one way or the other way. Whatever's best for the customer, I think serves our purpose, as well, and we're more than happy to accommodate that. Operator : At this point, we will turn the call back to NetApp for final remark. Thomas Georgens : Okay. Well, thank you, all, for joining us. We appreciate your interest in NetApp. And see you all in 90 days. Take care.",

My name is Eric. I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded. I will now turn the call over to Kris Newton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Kris, you may begin. Kris Newton : Hello, and thank you for joining us on our Q2 fiscal year '14 earnings call. With me today are CEO, Tom Georgens; and our CFO, Nick Noviello. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com, along with the earnings release, our financial tables, a historical supplemental data table and the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation. As a reminder, during today's call, we will make forward-looking statements with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons. We described some of these reasons in our accompanying press release, which we have furnished to the SEC on an 8-K. A detailed discussion of these reasons is included in our risk factors, included in our most recent 10-K and subsequent 10-Q reports, also on file with the SEC and available on our website, all of which are incorporated by reference into today's discussions. All numbers discussed today are GAAP unless stated otherwise. To see the reconciling items between the non-GAAP and GAAP, you may refer to the tables in our press release or on our website. In a moment, Nick will walk you through some additional color on our financial results, and then Tom will walk you through his perspective on the business this quarter. I'll now turn the call over to Nick. Nicholas R. Noviello: Thank you, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We delivered a number of positives in Q2, including strong non-GAAP gross margin and operating margin, both of which underscore the resiliency of our business model, as well as EPS over the high end of our previous guidance range. However, we are disappointed with our overall Q2 revenue performance. The continued, uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, combined with the U.S. federal government shutdown and larger-than-expected decline in our OEM business, impacted our top line revenue growth. As a result, total revenue came in $10 million below our previous guidance range. Despite the conservatism we built into our Q2 guidance to account for uncertainty in U.S. federal business related to sequestration and looming budget deadlines, we did not predict the degree to which sequestration, combined with the government shutdown, would impact our ability to close business in our pipeline. In addition, though we expected OEM business to be down in Q2, ordering patterns from our largest partners were off plan, reflecting their exposure to market dynamics. Net revenue for the quarter of $1.55 billion was up 2% sequentially and up 1% from Q2 of last year. Branded revenue was 90% of our overall revenue and, at $1.4 billion, was up 5% year-over-year and 4% sequentially. OEM revenue continued to decline in Q2 and was down 28% from Q2 last year and 9% from last quarter. Indirect revenues through the channels and OEMs accounted for 83% of Q2 revenue. Arrow and Avnet contributed 23% and 16% of net revenue, respectively. From a geographic perspective, our Americas Commercial and EMEA revenues were up 3% and 2%, respectively, versus Q2 last year. U.S. Public Sector revenue was down 8% versus last year, the largest year-over-year decline in the business we've seen in a Q2 since we began tracking it in fiscal year 2007. Finally, Asia-Pacific revenue was flat on a year-over-year basis and down 2% sequentially, continued evidence of macroeconomic pressure in that geography as well. Non-GAAP gross margin of 63.6% was well above our guidance range and benefited from particular strength in product gross margin. Non-GAAP product gross margin of 57.3% was at its highest rate in 9 quarters, illustrating our strong competitive position and driven primarily by more highly configured systems and favorable mix. Non-GAAP service gross margin of 58.9% was over a point better than last year but down slightly from Q1. Our non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 17.5%, over 3 points better than last year and over a point above our previous guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses were essentially flat as a percentage of revenue and flat year-over-year. Versus Q1, non-GAAP operating expenses were up 2%, reflecting run rate benefits from our realignment activities and prudent expense management, given the macro environment. Consistent with our previous guidance, Q2 diluted share count of 349 million shares decreased by approximately 11 million shares sequentially, primarily related to the full quarter benefit of repurchase activity in Q1. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.66 was up 29% from Q2 last year and exceeded the high end of our previous guidance range by $0.01. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.3 billion in cash and investments. Days sales outstanding at 35 and inventory at 20 turns reflect continued strong operational performance. Deferred revenue of $2.9 billion was essentially flat versus Q1 but up $162 million versus Q2 of last year. Cash from operations was approximately $363 million, an increase of 8% from Q2 of last year, and free cash flow was 21% of revenue. In Q2, we spent $150 million in share repurchases as well as $51 million in a cash dividend. As expected, we successfully completed the first $1 billion of our $3 billion share repurchase program in September. We remain on track to complete the second $1 billion of the program by the end of May 2014, consistent with our original guidance. Today, we also announced our next cash dividend of $0.15 per share of the company's stock to be paid on January 22, 2014. Separately, the warrants associated with the convertible notes that we retired this past June were exercised in September and October. For the quarter, the warrants increased diluted share count by just over 1 million shares. All settlements associated with the retired convertible notes and related hedges and warrants are now behind us. Now to our fiscal Q3 guidance. We remain well positioned in our business but must assume that the challenging macro environment will continue. Our target revenue range for Q3 is $1.575 billion to $1.675 billion which, at the midpoint, implies 5% sequential growth but flat revenue versus Q3 last year. We expect year-over-year branded revenue growth at just under Q2 levels and OEM revenue to begin to normalize but be very sensitive to demand from our partners. We expect consolidated non-GAAP gross margins of approximately 61.5% to 62% and non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 18%. Further, we expect our blended consolidated non-GAAP effective tax rate to remain relatively constant as we enter the back half of fiscal year. Based on our repurchases in the first 10 days of the quarter, we expect our diluted share count for Q3 to remain flat at approximately 350 million shares. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share for Q3 to range from approximately $0.68 to $0.73 per share, up from $0.67 last year. Recall that EPS last year included a $0.03 benefit from a lower tax rate resulting from reinstatement of the R&D tax credit in January. As we move into the second half of the year, we continue to expect macro uncertainty, which may intensify due to U.S. government challenges. That said, we believe we are well positioned to execute through these challenges. Our expectations around margins and EPS growth for fiscal 2014 remain unchanged. So ultimately dependent on revenue mix and growth, we are reiterating our expectations for approximately 61% non-GAAP gross margin and approximately 17% non-GAAP operating margin for the year. We continue to expect full year EPS growth in the mid-teens from operations and further supplemented by our capital allocation activity. We completed the first $1 billion of stock repurchases in September, 2013 and are on track to complete the second $1 billion by the end of May 2014, consistent with our original plan. At this point, I will turn the call over to Tom for his thoughts. Tom? Thomas Georgens : Thanks, Nick, and good afternoon, everyone. As Nick said, our OEM and U.S. federal businesses clearly presented a headwind, resulting in a shortfall to our revenue guidance, but other aspects of our business performed well in Q2. We remain confident in our competitive position as we produced very strong gross margins and continued to gain share with branded revenue growth of 5% year-over-year, well ahead of any of our major competitors. The robust gross margin, combined with prudent expense management, enabled us to deliver better-than-expected operating margin and EPS just over the high end of our previous guidance range. We are focused on delivering innovative best-of-breed solutions that are cloud-integrated and flash-accelerated. These solutions create a compelling value for our customers, which ultimately enables NetApp to gain share and deliver shareholder value. Customers are increasingly adopting our latest innovations and are confident that our strategy will enable them to navigate the future. We offer a differentiated approach to cloud and software-defined storage and have established leadership positions in key emerging areas, such as flash and converged infrastructure. During the quarter, we outlined our strategy to deliver cloud data management that spans both public and private clouds. As IT organizations attempt to keep pace with rapidly changing business demands, the move to integrate cloud offerings with on-premise IT resources is inevitable. This introduction of the cloud makes data governance even more complex. Data ONTAP, the #1 storage operating system, is uniquely positioned to integrate data management across hybrid on- and off-premise environments by providing data management and a common storage fabric. Clouds using ONTAP can efficiently connect with on-premise and other ONTAP-based clouds to move data and workloads easily, utilizing NetApp's data movement and portability technologies. This supports our customers, as they evolve their IT strategies and organizations from builders and operators to brokers of services across multiple cloud providers. Additionally, in Q2, we announced more cloud partnerships, expanding on our technology and cloud service provider ecosystem. We deepened the integration with Oracle's cloud-enabling software, so that customers can more easily and effectively manage their data across public and private cloud environments. We're at the core of Orange business system's flexible computing solution. With over 35 petabytes of NetApp storage, Orange now offers its customers superior availability and security. We also announced a strategic collaboration with Verizon to re-architect traditional cloud-based storage models using Data ONTAP in a virtual machine running on top of their hardware. Our partnership with Amazon Web Services continues to be strong, with tremendous customer interest and a growing number of partners building service offerings on NetApp Private Storage for AWS. With our partner ecosystem that helps connect on-premise infrastructure with cloud resources growing by the day, we offer customers more choice, simpler deployment options and enhanced functionality as they move to a hybrid IT environment. Software-defined storage is the next step in the evolution of virtualization and cloud architectures. It is based on the core tenet that resources are defined in software, managed through policies and available on a broad range of hardware. We pioneered this value proposition with Data ONTAP as our customers can manage data on all hardware, other vendors' hardware and on commodity hardware. Our leadership in software-defined storage now includes increased investments for hyperscale cloud service environments, more robust quality of service capabilities and expanded API integrations with emerging solutions like OpenStack and CloudStack. The momentum of clustered Data ONTAP remains strong. In Q2, we shipped more than 1,900 clustered nodes, an increase of almost 300% from Q2 a year ago and almost 60% from last quarter. 37% of high-end systems and 24% of mid-range systems were deployed in cluster configurations. In Q1 of this year, we introduced Data ONTAP 8.2, which makes it easier for our installed base to migrate and reap the benefits of clustered ONTAP. More than half of the controllers migrated from 7-mode to clustered ONTAP have occurred since ONTAP 8.2's introduction. Additionally, new customer acquisitions driven by clustered ONTAP accelerated in Q2. We also see strong adoption of our broad-portfolio of flash solutions, which enable customers to deploy the right level of performance, efficiency and scalability for their specific needs and workloads. Since the inception of our flash program, we have shipped over 60 petabytes of flash, almost 1/3 of which is in the form of all-flash arrays. The attach rate of our Flash Cache and Flash Pool solutions remains consistently high at approximately 60% from mid-range and high-end systems. In Q2, we shipped 6 petabytes of flash as a cache, accelerating just over 0.5 exabyte of storage. In Q1, we began shipping Flash Accel, our software that combines application integration and enterprise data management with the performance capabilities of host-side flash. We are seeing strong customer interest with customers in varying stages of qualification. Our all-flash array, the EF540, is also seeing robust customer traction with more than 200 units shipped in Q2. Soon, we will introduce the next generation of the EF product line with improved capacity, bandwidth and performance. In addition to strong growth of the all-flash EF540, we continue to see growth in the total branded E-Series product line. Unit shipments of branded E-series more than doubled year-over-year. Compared to Q2 a year ago, the FAS2000S and 6000s were down slightly and the FAS3000 units grew 15%. Across the board, we would have seen better growth in unit shipments had our federal business performed to expectations. We have a clear positioning of our FAS for shared infrastructure and E-series for dedicated workloads. By targeting unique and nonoverlapping segments, we continue to be best positioned to meet a broad range of customer requirements with the least amount of complexity. We believe that the majority of enterprise demand will be met through integrated solutions, customer's value integration as evidenced by the converged solutions in general and FlexPod specifically. FlexPod has been available for 3 years now, and we are seeing tremendous growth and success around the globe. In conjunction with Cisco, we have expanded the FlexPod offerings to include FlexPod data center, a single flexible architecture for enterprise workloads, FlexPod Express for small to midsized organizations and FlexPod Select for dedicated high-performance workloads. The FlexPod customer base has more than doubled from Q2 a year ago to almost 3,300. It is available in 84 countries, delivered by greater than 90 channel partners with 50 validated architectures. Clustered ONTAP deployments also represented 45% of our FlexPod business in Q2. Our focus on the customer and our decision to deliver the most cost-effective and flexible solution on the market has resulted in FlexPod's #1 position in integrated infrastructure as recognized by IDC. For the past year, we've talked about the challenging environment in which we are operating. The macro economy is uncertain and may get worse due to U.S. government dynamics. Unfortunately, I do not see any near-term resolution, and our guidance reflects what we believe is an appropriate level of conservatism. Nonetheless, we are well positioned, and we expect to continue to gain share regardless of the environment. Customers play significant importance on our ability to provide value through integration and the expansion of that value beyond the single data center into the hybrid cloud. Our ability to marry on-premise storage with cloud resources across hypervisors makes this hybrid cloud a reality. NetApp is at the forefront of a changing IT landscape, creating opportunities from perceived threats. Our focus on innovation and emerging technologies such as flash and converged architectures, our unique position in cloud and software-defined storage and our ability to leverage a strong partner ecosystem enables us to gain share and deliver shareholder value. Before opening up the call for Q&A, I would like to congratulate the entire NetApp team for again being ranked #3 on the World's Best Multinational Workplaces list by the Great Place to Work Institute. NetApp's unique culture is a differentiator that helps us produce great results for NetApp customers and partners in both good and challenging times. At this point, I'll open up the call for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Shebly Seyrafi is on line with a question. Shebly Seyrafi - FBN Securities, Inc., Research Division : Yes. So very impressive product gross margin, 57.3%, up 4 points sequentially. How much of that was due to brand versus OEM mix and what's your outlook going forward? Can you maintain around 57%? Or do you think it will go back to, say, 53% or 55% going forward? Nicholas R. Noviello: Shebly, it's Nick Noviello here. Let me walk you through the pieces to it. I think that the comment on the top, I would say this is -- this, to us, really comes about as overall the competitive position we have, right? That comes through in margins. But let me walk you through some of the pieces to the sequential. So there's about a 4-point difference between Q2 -- I'm sorry, Q1 and Q2 here, and I'll walk you through not only that but what we expect to occur in Q3. So between 1 and 2 points is really due to more richly configured systems in the quarter and volume, okay? So that's 1 to 2 points of the change. We have just over a point from product mix, right? Some of that is due to lower OEM volume than we originally anticipated, and some of product mix goes back the other way in Q3 because Q3 incorporates the calendar year end, which is when we expect generally a little bit heavier OEM business. And then just over a point relates frankly to some timing of supply chain efficiencies, part of which will roll through in normal course through pricing to customers in Q3. So there's a set of things that get you to those 4 points, 1 to 2 on the configuration and volume, just over a point on product mix, just over a point on the supply chain and pricing side of the fence. That's the 4. In terms of a Q3 -- moving from Q2 to Q3, what I would expect is some of that goes back the other way. So first of all, on the product mix side of the fence, because of heavier OEM business, that will go back, right? So maybe about a point there. And then that point that I said on the pricing and supply chain dynamics, that's normal course. That will go back the other way. So I would expect on a Q3 to look more like a 55% on the product gross margin than a 57% on the product gross margin. Thomas Georgens : If I could add a few things to that, first and foremost, I think we're really pleased with the gross margin. I think as a first indicator of overall competitiveness and strength in the value proposition, I think that's a really important metric for us as a company. So Nick talked about the OEM mix, strong quarter from our standalone software sales, from some of the acquisitions that we did and also company-wide initiative to really drive supply and COGS efficiency. [indiscernible] as this coincides with a very, very steep clustered ONTAP ramp. And I don't think it's purely happenstance that they're both happening at the same time. I think our team, I think our partners and I think our customers are now a lot more confident in understanding the value proposition that's translating through. The one quarter does not make a trend, but nonetheless, a really, really positive development for us. It's something that we feel really good about. So going forward, I think clearly, depending on market dynamics, perceived elasticity and strategic use, some of that we may protect to keep in the P&L and some of that we may use for offensive force to move some new customer acquisition. So overall, I think the clustered ONTAP component and, really, I think a much more firmer understanding and articulation of the value proposition across the entire industry is really a key contributor. So we're really pleased with that number. Operator : Andrew Nowinski is on line. Andrew J. Nowinski - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division : I'd like to get your thoughts on product revenue growth. Clearly, your branded revenue outperformed the competition this quarter. But as a whole, October of 2012 is really the last quarter where you delivered product revenue growth at or above normal seasonality. In the last 4 consecutive quarters, we've seen it slip well below normal levels. And obviously, I know the OEM component is weighing on that, but that's only 10% of your total revenues. So I guess, are there any underlying trends you can point to that are consistently keeping your product growth depressed, whether it's migration of data to the cloud or any sort of changing competitive dynamics? Thomas Georgens : Well, I think just kind of taking a competitive one on right away, I think if you go back and you look at our product revenue over time and you compare that to the competition, the numbers as well as I do. We see the server vendors down double digits. We see EMC's numbers out there. In fact, if you compare EMC's storage reported revenue against our branded revenue, the NetApp growth is actually bigger than theirs for 5 consecutive quarters now. So I think from a competitive perspective, I think clearly, we've got the upper hand on that battle; and we don't take it for granted but I don't think it's the competitive dynamic at play. I think, clearly, in an aggregate where you got NetApp and EMC as the fastest-growing players, we're both in single digits, and you've got the server vendors with half the market down double digits, clearly, I think it's reflected in the overall growth rate of the business. So I think clearly, industry growth rate is probably the biggest modulator on that number above anything else. If anything, I think the competitive argument actually swings in our favor, just given the relative performance of NetApp compared to the rest of the group. Nicholas R. Noviello: Yes. And then, Andrew, the only thing I'd add, and this is Nick, is that you mentioned the OEM side of the fence. But the OEM side was down 28% year-on-year, so it's going to have an impact to the number. Operator : Amit Daryanani is on line with a question. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Just a question on the Jan guide, given the softness you just talked about in the October quarter, maybe you can help me understand what gives you the comfort that Jan quarter is going to be much more closer to the seasonal trend of up 5%, call it. I'm wondering if you just have some orders that were delayed and that get pushed out into Jan quarter, if you can give us some share gain opportunity. Maybe just talk about, given the softness in October, why the comfort for seasonal ramp back in Jan? Thomas Georgens : Well, I don't -- we don't have any units that we didn't ship or anything like that. So there's nothing special about the end of the quarter transition in terms of backlog or anything like that. And I just think, if we look at the outlook, I don't like to call flat as optimistic world view. We're certainly not happy with that at all. But if I think we just look at our pipeline, we look at the business that's out there, we look where we're winning, where we're losing, we certainly understand the federal side of this and the fact that there really was no resolution last time so we went through a shutdown. But still, we still have the end of the continuing resolution within our quarter once again in January. So I think all of those things factor in. But if I look at the business x federal, particularly this quarter that we just passed, it's sort of been a monster quarter had we had another $50 million out of the federal business. So I think, overall, we held up pretty well. While I'm not overly optimistic that there's going to be a rebound in the macro sense, I think that a flat number is hardly anything to be proud of. Maybe in the environment, it is. But I don't think it's an overly aggressive number. It's something that we want to back away from at this point. Operator : Srini Nandury is on line. Srini Nandury - Summit Research Partners, LLC: You mentioned briefly that the -- I mean, the mix helped you with the gross margins. And you also mentioned previously in your comments that your FAS6000 has been down slightly and FAS2000 also has been down. Can you comment what's driving the reach [ph] configurations there? Thomas Georgens : Well, the reach [ph] configuration is really a measure of software specs [ph]. That's really what drives the gross margin. That's what really drives the value that we can convey to our customers. We also have some mix of our software -- standalone software products had a pretty good quarter and clearly, they carry high gross margin. So it isn't so much. I think we talked about this on the call before is the 6000s generally carry a fair amount of software, but they also carry a fair amount of hard drives, which are not high gross margin items for us. And the flip side is this, the lower-end units, the 2000s, are not that heavy on disk drives so they're not carrying a lot of the low gross margin. So therefore, the variability of margin across the product line is actually relatively constant. So therefore, over the years, as we've see the fair amount of volatility, as the market expands and contracts, the relative growth of the different segments, the gross margin has actually been relatively consistent. So I think this is more about software value proposition, independent of the individual hardware component. Operator : Aaron Rakers is on line. Aaron C. Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division : Kind of building on that, I guess part of that, can you talk about the capacity shipment growth this last quarter? And in that context, how we should think about deals such as one that you've signed with Verizon, how we think about that in terms of longer-term model? If I heard you correctly, I think you said that they were going to host your Data ONTAP on their own machines. So I'm curious of how we should think about that in the context of, be it selling disks or selling hardware over the long term. Thomas Georgens : Well, capacity growth, just to give a direct answer to the question, was a little over 20% this quarter. And I think that's the highest it's been in a while. But I've also said on prior calls, one of the reasons why we don't report it anymore is that, that's not a primary indicator of our business. So we do things like V-Series. We do things like virtual storage array. So I don't think that our businesses are tied to disk shipments as perhaps some of our competitors are. We're really about proliferating Data ONTAP. I think the more data in the world that's written and formatted by Data ONTAP is an opportunity for us to add software to it and add value and add differentiation as time goes on. So capacity is interesting, but I don't think it's the primary metric of the business. Clearly, we just had a great capacity quarter, but it was still a 1% revenue quarter. Admittedly, 5% branded and strong growth as the competition. But I don't think that capacity correlates with overall NetApp financial health. In fact, we just had capacity up and gross margins up quite a bit as well. So as we think about things like Verizon and AWS and things of that nature, at our core, our differentiation is our software. And that's where we're going to derive our value. And the format in which we deliver that is clearly going to have to evolve as we pursue some of these very, very large opportunities around these aggregators, whether they be traditional service providers or the hyperscalers. So generally and philosophically, I think this has always been true. The proliferation of our software is really the way NetApp is going to continue to do data management in the future and the way we're going to continue to distribute our value. So from our point of view, I think opportunities to go to Verizon with an alternative model that's software-only, that creates a very, very large pool of ONTAP-written data, I think actually expands our opportunity over time. So I think I want to be really clear. We're not a storage systems company per se. We're a data management company, and therefore, it's about software's ubiquity. And that's what we're trying to drive with those products and our product strategy, whether it be Amazon or whether it be Verizon. And you should expect to see more like that as time goes on. Operator : Ben Reitzes is on line. Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division : I wanted to ask a question about APAC and then just overall. In APAC, is there anything more going on there? I asked this question on the Cisco call, but there's been a lot of concerns around the NSA and U.S. brands losing momentum in APAC. And the inability to book and recognize stuff into revenue is not something that seems to be the case, just at NetApp. I was wondering what you're seeing there and when can APAC recover. Depending on your answer to that question, are there other NSA concerns and when can that geo recover? Is there anything bigger going on there? Thomas Georgens : And if I look at our APAC business in the aggregate this quarter, it had been, historically, our most robust business and had very, very strong growth. And this quarter, we backed off on that. And I think perhaps somewhat counter to some other commentary, where we saw the business strong was China was strong again. ASEAN [ph], basically South Asia was very strong again for us. India actually had a bit of a comeback after being relatively slow for us. Frankly, it's been Japan, after 3 very, very, very strong years, was off. And Australia's been off and I think Australia is a bit more macro-centric. So Japan, I'm not anticipating that, that's going to be a trend. I'm viewing that as timing of orders. But I would -- excuse me, the segments where we'd be most vulnerable to some type of Snowden backlash, those businesses remained robust for us. In fact, we're quite pleased with our China progress. I think last quarter, we reported China up 40%. It wasn't quite that high this quarter but still a very, very good number. So for us, it's actually been some of the more mature markets in Asia that have been more problematic for us, and I'm expecting Japan to bounce back. And I think -- Australia, I think, is a little bit more of a macro concern, and we certainly had some, over the last 6 months, some currency dynamics at play there as well in all those geos. Operator : Kulbinder Garcha is on line. Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : A question on the branded business, for Tom maybe. I was under the impression that the branded business would see accelerating growth from here onwards. It didn't quite produce so I'm just -- I understand there's a lot of different macro shifts in the world as you went through this quarter. I'm just kind of curious, given the portfolio refresh, is that still something that we could expect going forward? I just think you have an ability to gain share, given the refresh on the portfolio. Then -- and on the OEM revenue, are we at a level now in absolute dollar terms where it should stabilize? Or is it vulnerable still to maybe surprising you on the downside in these coming quarters, do you think? Thomas Georgens : Well, the one comment I'd have on the branded side is I absolutely agree with you that we have an opportunity to gain share. And in fact, we are gaining share; and in fact, we are outgrowing the market with our branded business. So I think we're seeing all of that. But that's in a backdrop of obviously a weak macro and obviously, federal. I mean, to put federal in context, another $50 million worth of federal business would have made a big difference in our growth and it would have got us substantially to where we guided. And to put this -- just to kind of give you -- we don't' report bookings. But just to kind of give you a sense of the trajectory of our federal business, we entered this fiscal year in May fully cognizant of the sequester. And our federal business was exactly on their annual plan, give or take $100,000 in Q1. In Q2, they were off by $85 million and that's what we saw and that has a big impact on our business. You put that $85 million back in the number, and this would have been a blowout quarter across every metric and we would have been seeing aggressive branded growth. Now on the OEM side, I think there's clearly 2 factors at play there in the OEM business. There's clearly the underlying fundamentals of our partners' business and there's product mix within our partners. And at IBM, clearly both of those are at play. What's a surprise, and probably took us down more than we would have expected this past quarter was that Teradata, who's been a great partner, has had a really, really strong run. They also preannounced a revenue shortfall that we clearly saw. So that was probably the thing that we were not expecting in the OEM business. And that's why the OEM business, we're showing the plan that we put out there. But those 2 components, the federal side and the OEM side, you put those back in the number and you translate that through our gross margin to EPS, it would have been a very, very, very strong EPS quarter. Operator : Maynard Um is on line. Maynard Joseph Um - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : I just have a question about -- in terms of the federal, I understand sort of the pushouts and waiting for the continuing resolution. But I'm just wondering if these are types of deals and I guess projects that are, not so much lost, but at some point will then come back. I guess the real question is, are these just pushouts of the revenue to future quarters, and so the visibility of when it happens isn't that great, but at -- it's not a question, I guess, of when but if it comes back? I'm just curious if that's sort of your viewpoint and we just have to figure out when the revenue starts to come back in. Does that make sense? Thomas Georgens : Well, I think a few things happened, one of which was, as we came upon the end of the government fiscal year, usually there's a lot of money sloshing around at the end and it generates obviously a very, very frothy September. And I think in the context of the sequester, just how much of that money would really be around was a big concern. And I think the sequester certainly had a tempering effect on end-of-the-year spending by the U.S. government. So now we go forward, really nothing's been resolved, right? We just pushed the continuing resolution out until -- out to January and the debt ceiling presumably to February. But it's likely that the sequester spending levels, no matter what happens, will remain intact and this could further be just kicked down the road another 90 days. So I think the federal side, when we talk about bouncing back we're talking about bouncing back most likely to sequester-spending levels. But in the meantime, there's a fair amount of uncertainty. And probably my broader concern, frankly, is that companies like us that have a dependency upon that business and we see it slow down and perhaps for a protracted period of time, that has impact on our spending. And if other companies are acting like we are, then clearly, the impact of the government is going to spill over to the commercial side of the house, and then we'll see that going forward as well. And that is also reflected in our guidance to some degree. So I'm not expecting it to be as simple as one day, a bill is going to be signed and suddenly there's going to be a flush of federal revenue. I think last year is over, and I don't think that, that's going to necessarily flow into this year. I think this year will be built around the current spending levels that will include the sequester. So if this is big, avalanche of business are suddenly going to come our way to make up for what didn't get bought at the end of last year. I just don't believe that's the case. Operator : Ananda Baruah is on line. Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division : Tom and Nick, just -- was wanting to get your thoughts on, I guess, buyback as we look through the year. And I guess you're guiding the share count to be flat Jan quarter versus October quarter. What's sort of your expectations regards to share count reductions as you look through the year? I know you're saying that you're expecting to go through the $1 billion by May. I guess from the share count perspective, how should we expect that to manifest in the model? Nicholas R. Noviello: Yes. Ananda, it's Nick. Let me just walk you through the pieces. So when we give guidance for the third quarter at 350 million shares, what we've included in there is what we've purchased so far in the quarter, which is 7 million shares and really, it's sort of where we're at today. And the reason for doing that is because in a situation where we can do a combination of open-market purchases, accelerated purchases, timing on all those purchases, the amount and ultimate impact on diluted share count for the quarter can, frankly, move around pretty significantly. So at the end of the day, we'll be consistent with what we've done in the past, which I say, expect us to do $1 billion between now and May. As we enter a quarter, we'll give you our best view given on the first -- given the first 10 days of where we're at. As we exit a quarter, you'll obviously in the -- see in the cash flow statement what we actually spent, and we'll talk about it and do the same thing going forward. So we'll maintain a consistent approach here. I think the overall theme that you should keep in mind as we will do the additional $1 billion, we're on plan to do that. We will be opportunistic in that, but we will consider anything from open-market purchases to accelerated plans. Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division : Okay, got it. So Nick, I guess just to clarify that, it sounds like you're saying, as of right now, this is your guidance. But the impact could be different as we move through the quarter, depending. Nicholas R. Noviello: That's correct, because that 350 million is based upon the first 10 days of activity. So just like the 350 million can change as a result of exercises, as a result of share price, as a result of some other things, it can also move as a result of repurchases that we do in the quarter. The ultimate timing of those repurchases will also impact how much shows up in the weighted average. So there's a lot of moving parts. So the definitive stuff we can give you is what's already behind us, which is the first 10 days. Operator : Scott Craig is on line. Scott D. Craig - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : You guys have done a really good job on the cash cycle, and it's 2 quarters in a row, where it's been at a pretty low level, I guess, relative to historical. So can you walk us through any pushes and pulls you see on that going forward? Is this some -- is this sort of a new level, where we're setting the bar at now? Nicholas R. Noviello: Yes. Maybe you can clarify for me in terms of cash cycle. Are you talking about how we're doing on the DSOs and on the inventory side of the fence? Or are you saying something else? Scott D. Craig - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Yes, it would be the total of the 3 components of it, just adding to a really good number over the last couple of quarters. Nicholas R. Noviello: Yes. I think there is some seasonality that will always happen on the receivable side of the fence. But what we've seen here is, on top of the seasonality, some real operational improvement that's happened quarter after quarter and when we look year-over-year that we can see that improvement. So that is real. On the inventory side, we had built up -- frankly, we had built up as a result of the Engenio acquisition and had to move through all the integration activity there. We had inventory as a result of the Thailand drive crisis. We've had inventory as we go through manufacturing our transitions. We do all of that, and we manage all of those things but, again, I think very strong performance. Our expectation was that inventory turns were going to come up this year, and they are doing that. So I think across the board on the operational stuff, we are -- we're doing quite well. Thomas Georgens : Yes, we did. I think that's 3 quarters now of inventory turns over 19. So those are good numbers, particularly there in the OEM business, which has a lot of inventory that we hold on behalf of our partners. So I think integrating that business into NetApp and still pushing inventory turns near historical highs, I'm really pleased with the work the team has done. And overall, you see the cash flow number. And that's pretty significant cash flow in a quarter where NetApp was roughly flat in overall revenue. So clearly, I think the execution side of the house was very, very strong this quarter, and it proves that NetApp is a very, very strong cash generator even in a tough environment. Operator : Bill Shope is on line. Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Looking at the answers to some of the prior questions, particularly around gross margin, it sounds like you guys do think you can continue to ship more richly configured systems. And outside of the software demand that you're seeing from the cloud-centric customers, and if we look at your traditional enterprise customer base, can you give some color on what specific add-ons you're seeing the greatest incremental demand for? And are there specific workloads that you think are driving this over time? Thomas Georgens : Yes, that's a good question. I think -- if I think about clustered ONTAP overall, we talked about the use cases of clustered ONTAP, some of which are clear and some of which, I think, are new to NetApp. So the traditional use case of NetApp is enterprise file services. We've already got some of the biggest installations in the world, and clustered ONTAP allows us to supply that at scale. I don't think that's new to anybody. Likewise, virtualization is a big bet for us, and clustered ONTAP allows us to build much more significant infrastructures that allow customers to virtualize even more mission-critical applications. But I think the other part of it for NetApp is to be able to take this technology into a set of workloads where we previously had not been servicing by virtue of the [indiscernible] scale, the performance of the nondisruptive capability of clustered ONTAP; and a lot of those are software-intensive. So I think it's a combination of the customers understanding the value proposition, how to present it, how to price it. But I also think it's opening up new workloads to us, and I think that's a big part of our new customer acquisition. An interesting component of the FlexPod business, by the way, is roughly half the FlexPod business, I think a little at 45% or so of the FlexPod, are actually sold with clustered ONTAP. A lot of that was going into new deployments. A lot of that was going to new customers, driven by our joint channel partners between us and Cisco and some of our other partners. And by the way, I believe I misspoke on the prepared statements. We have 900 channel partners selling FlexPod, not 90. But overall, I think that -- I think, really, the story at the end of the day here isn't so much the software attach rate. It's really the aggregate business value of the product compared to the applications that we're deploying. And I think the better we understand and can articulate, the better the customers understand the value, the better we're able to defend the price, and therefore, command the gross margin that's appropriate to the technology we provide. Operator : We have Lou Miscioscia on line. Louis R. Miscioscia - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division : Okay, great. Tom, I want to drill on a little bit more about flash in the sense that it sounds like you're doing well. But just curious, how much are you actually selling into the installed base? And when you look at all the start-ups, I mean, collectively, whether they're hybrid array vendors or all-flash array vendors, they seem to be having a material amount of revenue. Obviously, if they didn't exist, that would be growth most likely going to you. So is one issue that for FAS and ONTAP, if the legacy code really just doesn't work as well with hybrids or all flash, I mean, actually, your FlashRay isn't out yet. And then secondly, as for the FAS side, have you actually moved to NOC or you're still using a more expensive SOC? Thomas Georgens : Yes, I think on the flash question, I think the success and the raw performance of the EF540 should lay to rest the canard that there's something magical about flash drives that work around prior disk technology somehow is irrelevant. Frankly, the EF540 team has been doing this thing for a long time, and it's something to be said for code stream optimization. And the fact that they can outperform all the other supposedly flash-optimized products pretty much puts to rest that argument. I think that the real component here, though, is that ONTAP is really built around a very, very broad feature set around data management, things like that, which are not suited to necessarily an all-flash array. I mean, at the end of the day, the all-flash array is about delivering performance ay low latency to applications and that's really the optimized design point for the EF540, and that's why it's been so successful. The other thing that the EF540 brings with it that the startups don't have is, if you look at the primary EF540 use case that we see right now, it's been database acceleration, which is usually in front of some other basically mainframe or monolithic storage products; and those are pretty significant and demanding environment. So the fact the EF540 can bring very high performance and very mature HA to that environment is a key differentiator. And that pretty much knocks out a lot of the startup companies and the immature products from the other mature vendors out of that category. So if you look at what's moving the EF540, it's basically extreme strong performance, not from some brand-new data layout, but from basically 20 years of experience in optimizing code lines and the ability to overlay that with high availability to go aggressively after these use cases. And like I said, database acceleration is a classic one. Another use case that we're seeing out there is basically taking monolithic arrays that have got short-stroke hard drives that are basically trying to drive performance out of the hard drive or replacing them outright. So we've actually had a couple of installations where we actually used EF540s to replace traditional frame arrays. So we pretty excited about that particular segment. And overall, for all this talk about this market, NetApp from effectively s standing start in February, shipped almost 550 systems. And that's got to put us in the top 2 or 3 position overall in the all-flash market. If we stay on this trajectory, obviously, we can go up from there. Louis R. Miscioscia - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division : And how about the ONTAP side, because there's got to be use cases there too, how do you resolve that? Thomas Georgens : Yes, I think that there's a pure hybrid use case, which I think is a much, much bigger market opportunity than all-flash array. So I think the idea of basically using flash to accelerate very, very large pools of back-end storage and then use all the other features of ONTAP, the replication, the data protection, the application integration, the storage efficiency and all of those things, to basically marry those 2 technologies. So by no means do I see all-flash array as a substitute for flash-integrated like the Flash Cache and the Flash Pool within ONTAP. I just think that they serve different use cases, particularly around the performance case. And in the end, I think the winning story here is basically the integration of those 2. Because I believe that in the end, all flash deployments are hybrid in nature at the macro level. So I think that the integration of flash with ONTAP is really going to be long-term differentiator here as opposed to standalone point product providers. Operator : Stephen Fox [ph] is on line. Unknown Analyst : Just to follow up on that last question. So just specifically from a marketing standpoint, it sounds like some of the newer competitors aren't sort of taking share from you. It sounds like you're in a position to take share. Can you just sort of talk about how you would say near term before some of that evolution takes place, you would position yourself from a flash standpoint within the market? And then secondly, I don't know if you want to pass on this question or not. But there's been a couple of lawsuits filed by you and EMC regarding some companies planning on coming public or may come public. I don't know, I'm just curious what that says about the competitive environment for some of the startups. Thomas Georgens : Well, a few things. One of them is, as far as the startup community, frankly, only a handful of them are generating revenue. But it's still revenue, right? And in a low-growth market, it all matters. So it's not something that we take lightly and we -- or something that we're ignoring. But in the end, the long-term innovators and the long-term market share players in this space are going to be NetApp and EMC, and we certainly see EMC a lot more than we see anybody else. In terms of the generic category of legal activity, clearly, we're going to protect our intellectual property and we're going to protect our confidential information. We're going to take the appropriate steps to do that. We've taken a few actions, not all of them against small companies. And the one you referred to, Nimble, has been the latest one. But there's nothing special about that one and frankly, the other 2 that preceded it have achieved a favorable outcome for NetApp. So these are not frivolous activities. These are basically us protecting legitimate interest and have a legitimate grievance, and we'll do more of them if necessary. But I would say it's not in a response to any specific competitive IPO dynamic or anything like that, because we've done them to big companies to small companies, pre-IPO and post-IPO. Unknown Analyst : Great, that's very helpful. And then just one quick clarification. I think I understood this correctly, but there's been no change in your roadmap on the all-flash array if we look out over the next several quarters. Is that correct? Thomas Georgens : No, no. But I think you'll -- I think flash array data this year and availability next year, and EF540 and EF550 will be -- you'll see an upgrade to that soon. Operator : Brian Alexander is on line. Brian G. Alexander - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Nick, you mentioned at the beginning that the margin guidance is unchanged for fiscal '14. If I back into what that implies for your fourth quarter based on the first half results and the guidance for Q3, it would suggest that gross margins will be down materially in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, and operating margins will be basically flat sequentially. So can you just talk a little bit more about the margin dynamics beyond the third quarter? You did a great job laying out the puts and takes for Q2 and Q3. And am I reading your annual targets too literally? Or do you think you can actually exceed those, based on the results and progress you've made this year? Nicholas R. Noviello: Well, I haven't done anything other than say what the annual targets were at the beginning of the year and reiterate the fact that, that's what we believe we will be able to deliver. At the end of the day, those are always going to be subject to revenue and mix and all of those other pieces. I think what you should be thinking about as well is we started the year with an operating margin of sub-15%, right? We did quite well in the second quarter. You can see what we're guiding to in the third quarter here. But the year is a -- it's going to keep moving, so there's also moving parts there. There's investments that we may or may not decide to make. There are sets of dynamics in the business that we may or may not decide to do. So what I want you to take away is, overall, that guidance we are firm on. We are also firm on being able to generate earnings per share growth from operations alone in the mid-teens, which is not changed. So despite the fact that there's pressure out there on the revenue side of the fence, certainly in Q2, we've got some obviously -- certainly versus where the street is, guided conservatively for Q3 based upon the macro condition, we feel very good about the results that we can generate inside of that. Brian G. Alexander - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Great and just a quick follow-up, Tom. On the service provider relationships that you've been announcing, just to be clear, you view these partnerships as incremental gross profit dollar growth opportunities as opposed to cannibalizing existing sales either to service providers or to enterprises that are moving to the cloud. You view this as basically TAM expansion, if you will. Thomas Georgens : Well, I mean, clearly, it ultimately depends on how this all plays out. But I guess, from a philosophical point of view is, if you look at -- and if you look at our business overall and you look at our aggregate market share in the teens, one of the challenges that we have and, frankly, everybody has in the company, everybody wishes they had more coverage and everybody wishes they were able to reach more customers. So if entities are going to emerge that are going to consolidate substantial amounts of customer demand in one place and we can participate in that, then I think that, compared to our 16% enterprise share, there's an opportunity to participate in a much bigger percentage of the business, whether that's consolidated Amazon, whether it's consolidated Verizon or Orange or other players as we go down this list. So what we see them as a consolidator of demand and therefore, a very, very interesting target for us. And if we can be successful there and get them to standardize on ONTAP-based technology, then there's enormous opportunity for us to continue to add value, continue to bring software to bear on those problems and also to integrate on-premise and off-prem computing. I mean, if we have a very, very strong premise at the cloud providers, both traditional service providers and hyperscalers, what customers really want is a seamless data management interface between on-prem and off-prem that actually might generate demand in on-premise computing in the traditional market. So I think it's going to be an integral part of how people see the market going forward. And the more market share we can gain in the service provider community and the easier we can make that technology to integrate with people's IT infrastructure, I think the stronger we become overall as an enterprise data management player. So from that perspective, TAM expansion, on an incremental basis, I think it's a more strategic conversation than that. It's -- I think it's about the ubiquity of ONTAP. And if the ONTAP is ubiquitous, I think that's a good thing for NetApp. Operator : And our last question comes from Steve Milunovich. Steven Milunovich - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Nick, I believe the company is planning on about $30 million of savings this quarter based on prior headcount reductions and savings. Is that the number that came through? And was that all reinvested? Or did some of that drop to the bottom line? And how do you see that playing out over the next quarter? Nicholas R. Noviello: Yes, so that was pretty close to just under that was what we delivered in gross from those activities we did at the beginning of the first quarter around realignment. That is also reinvested, right? So all of those things take place and that is up all built into the operating expense line that we delivered for the quarter. So we did generate the savings, not quite $30 million, just below that. And we did reinvest in a number of areas across the company with those savings. Steven Milunovich - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : And you plan to pretty much reinvest 100% again next quarter? Nicholas R. Noviello: Well, what we had indicated as we opened up the year is that our plan is to reinvestment but we will use that as a lever, right? Because to the degree market conditions change, right, we are also looking to deliver on an overall plan for the company, both inside and outside. So we preserve that lever. Some of the reinvestments are things that play out over longer periods of time. Some of the have onetime, shorter-term impact. We run and really drive all of those levers here as we run the company. Thomas Georgens : If I could just follow on to that a little bit and wrap up, I think -- to Nick's point, I think the execution intensity of the company was very, very high this quarter. We talked earlier about gross margins. We talked about DSO. We talked about inventory turns. The realignment that Nick just talked about, we navigated that without disrupting the business. We moved a factory in our first quarter with 0 disruption overall. And the other thing about this quarter is the shutdown was complicated on a number of fronts. Not only were purchasing people deemed not essential, we had a lot of clients that weren't accepting deliveries. So we actually had complexity around shipping product that we already had orders for. And the other dynamic, a little subtle, is that our quarter ended on the 25th, so there wasn't a lot of time between the shutdown release and the end of the quarter. And I think the team's response to that was very, very, very strong. And I don't think we left much behind. So overall, if I look at this quarter, and just kind of a closing statement is that clearly it's a challenging environment. The fed makes it only more challenging. But I think within that, I think NetApp's competitive posture is demonstrated in the gross margin. It's demonstrated in the branded product growth. And if I look at our portfolio, clustered ONTAP is still in its early days. EF is still in its early days. FlashRay on the way. E-Series is a new technology that was just really starting to get some traction in the channel. If I look at our portfolio, I see a lot of technology in the early days of its monetization. So I can't say with confidence that the macro is going to rebound and rebound strong and when that's going to happen. But I can say that no matter what happens in the macro, NetApp is strong and we intend to continue to gain share regardless of the world around us. And that's going to be our focus. So thanks for your time. Thanks for your interest in NetApp, and see you all in 90 days. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

I'll now turn the call over to Nick. Nick Noviello : Thank you, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. NetApp executed another quarter of solid financial results, driven by our strong innovation, competitive position and operational performance. We delivered revenue within our prior guidance range and non-GAAP gross margin, operating margin and EPS all over the high end of our Q3 guidance range. Net revenues of $1.61 billion were up 4% sequentially, but down 1% year-over-year. Branded revenue of $1.5 billion grew 4% sequentially and 2% year-over-year. Branded revenue was below our expectations for the quarter, driven solely by a shortfall in US federal business. OEM revenue dollars were flat from Q2, as expected, and down 23% year-over-year. Indirect revenues through the channels and OEMs accounted for 83% of Q3 revenue. Arrow and Avnet contributed 20% and 15% of net revenue respectively. From a geographic perspective, total Americas revenue was down 5% year-over-year. Americas Commercial revenue was down 3% and US Public Sector revenue was down 13%, driven by downward pressure in federal IT spending. EMEA and Asia-Pacific revenue each grew 3% on a year-over-year basis. Non-GAAP gross margin of 63.5% was just 10 basis points below Q2 levels, but above our prior guidance range due to a combination of strong execution across our organization and lower-than-anticipated spending. Non-GAAP product gross margin of 57.1% was 4 points better than Q3 last year and down 20 basis points sequentially. We recognized the expected product gross margin pressure during the quarter from a less favorable mix of business. However that pressure was offset by further productivity and efficiency gains driven by our operations team, which we expect will be passed through to pricing over time. Non-GAAP service gross margin of 60.8% was more than 2 points better than Q3 last year and up almost 2 points sequentially, reflecting lower-than-anticipated spending across our services infrastructure. Non-GAAP operating margins for the third quarter was 19.5%, over 2 points better than Q3 last year and above our previous guidance. As a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP operating expenses declined 2 points from Q2, reflecting continued prudent expense management, given the environment we're operating in. The non-GAAP effective tax rate for Q3 was 17.6% above our prior guidance. This reflects a true-up for the first half of the year, as we now believe our annual rates to increase to just under 17%, driven by a slight shift in the geographic mix of profits. Going forward, we are working to a change in how we report our non-GAAP effective tax rate, to be more reflective of our operational results and tax structure and to provide a better comparison with our peers. We expect to adopt this change in the next couple of quarters and will provide more information at that time. Q3 diluted share count of 346 million shares decreased by approximately 3 million shares from Q2 and was below our prior guidance by approximately 4 million shares due to the partial benefit from a Q3 repurchase activity. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.75 was up 12% from Q3 last year and exceeded the high end of our previous guidance range by $0.02. Cash flow and balance sheet metrics were strong again in Q3. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.1 billion in cash in investments, 20% of which is onshore, and generated $332 million in cash from operations. Free cash flow was 17% of net revenue. Days sales outstanding at 33 and inventory turns at 20 reflect continued strong operational performance. Deferred revenue of $3 billion was up $27 million versus Q2 and up $83 million versus Q3 last year. In Q3, we spent $507 million in share repurchases and $50 million in cash dividends. We have spent over $1.5 billion and have successfully repurchased over 37 million shares of stock since we announced the program nine months ago. We remain on track to complete $2 billion of share repurchases by the end of May, consistent with our original guidance. Today, we also announced our next cash dividend of $0.15 per share of the company stock to be paid on April 22. Now to our guidance. We remain confident in our strategy, competitive position and operating model. However, we have to anticipate that this challenging IT spending environment will continue. As a result, our target revenue range for Q4 is $1.62 billion to $1.72 billion, which at the midpoint implies 4% sequential growth, but a 3% decline in revenue versus Q4 last year. We expect to continue to drive strong operational performance in Q4 and prudently manage expenses to generate consolidated non-GAAP gross margins of approximately 62.5% and non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 19% to 19.5%. Based on our repurchases in Q3 and in the first 10 days of Q4, we expect our diluted share count for the quarter to decline to approximately 340 million shares. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share for Q4 to range from approximately $0.77 to $0.82 per share, up from $0.69 last year. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom for his perspective. Tom? Tom Georgens : Thanks, Nick, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased with our execution again this quarter. Though we had some pressure from the dynamics in US federal IT spending, which we expect to continue, we expect ongoing market share gains driven by our strong competitive positioning and our differentiated product portfolio. Through solid operational execution and prudently managing expenses, we drove upside gross margin and delivered operating margin and EPS above the high end of our previous guidance range. Our strategy of delivering innovative best-of-breed solutions that are cloud-integrated and flash-accelerated is well in line with customers' top priorities. IT organizations are in the midst of a transition as they evaluate the role of new technologies and delivery models in their environments. Although this transition has resulted in slower decisions and elongated sales cycles, they also present opportunity. Customers are adding flash at all layers of their storage hierarchy and are shifting to an integrated mix of on-premise and off-premise IT infrastructure known as hybrid cloud. NetApp has established a market-leading position in flash and converged infrastructure and offers a differentiated approach to cloud and software-defined storage. Customers continue to adopt our latest innovations, confident in our strategy will help navigate this transition and position themselves well for the future. It is imperative that CIOs maintain control of their data in a hybrid cloud environment. As they seek to pull public cloud into the mix of their IT delivery, they have an opportunity to offload the burden of infrastructure and application management, but cannot offload the ownership and responsibility of their business data. The versatility, efficiency and ubiquity of Data ONTAP enables our customers to build solutions optimized for their specific needs. The solutions we deliver today and our innovative strategies for tomorrow directly address that CIOs need to seamlessly manage data stewardship across hybrid environments, while giving them choice in technologies, applications and cloud providers. Our strategy to work closer with a broad set of service provider partners, including hyperscalers has proven successful and resulted in IDC ranking NetApp as the leading provider of storage capacity for the public cloud infrastructure. Some service providers and very large enterprises are evaluating the concept of software-defined storage as part of the evolution of their virtualization and cloud architectures. With Data ONTAP, the number one storage operating system, NetApp pioneered the software-defined concept of defining resources and software, managing through policies and delivering storage services across a broad range of hardware. Data ONTAP paves the way for customers deploying software-defined data centers by eliminated the limitations and complexity of traditional hardware silo models. The flexibility, performance and non-disruptive operations enabled by clustered Data ONTAP are valuable both in on-premise data centers and cloud environments. With the storage architecture that can manage multiple, disparate workloads and service level requirements, enterprises and service providers can adapt in the face of unpredictable data growth and dynamic business demands with reduced complexity and cost. The applicability of clustered ONTAP of both on-premise and cloud environments is driving an accelerating rate of adoption. Clustered nodes were up more than 40% sequentially and more than triple from Q3 of last year. The attach rate of clustered ONTAP increased across every FAS product line, with the largest increase occurring in our mid-range systems, demonstrating a breadth of the acceptance of this technology within our customer base and our partner community. Adoption of our flash solution is also increasing. We believe that customers will deploy flash at every layer in the stack to solve a wide variety of challenges. This market is clearly not one-size-fits-all. Our broad portfolio includes both hybrid and all-flash storage offerings, which enable IT organizations to optimize the level of performance, efficiency and scalability to meet their specific needs. We have shipped almost 75 petabytes of flash storage since the inception of our flash program, roughly one-third of which is in the form of all-flash arrays. We are very pleased with the success of our all-flash EF product line. During the quarter, we introduced the EF550 with greater performance and capacity than the previous generation EF540. Also, in Q3 alone, we added more new EF customers than the prior cumulative total. These customers represent a wide number of verticals with database acceleration as the primary use case. In addition to the strong traction we're seeing with the EF products, we're also seeing an accelerating number of customers deploying FAS systems at all-flash configurations. These all-flash FAS arrays are also being deployed across many verticals with VDI and shared storage as the primary use cases. Customers value the maturity of proven storage arrays with the performance of flash and they're not willing to sacrifice reliability, manageability and data protection in their flash infrastructure. The momentum of our hybrid solutions and both the EF and all-flash FAS products with flash array on the lay gives NetApp a very strong position in the flash market. We're also seeing continued growth in the total branded E-Series product line. E-Series, inclusive of both E and EF products, almost doubled from Q3 a year ago and grew 34% sequentially. FAS2000 units were flat sequentially, while FAS3000 systems grew 8% and FAS6000 grew 16% from last quarter. We will soon be introducing our first generation of cluster-optimized FAS platforms, enabling customers to deploy a wider range of performance, availability and capacity options or seamlessly manage the clustered ONTAP. Our strategy and execution in converged architectures continues to drive positive results, with the FlexPod customer base growing more than 75% from Q3 last year. In Q3, we expanded the Cooperative Support Program with Microsoft joining Cisco, NetApp, VMWare and Citrix. Additionally, we announced enhanced cloud capabilities with new validated designs for FlexPod data center with Microsoft private cloud and FlexPod data center with Citrix cloud platform powered by Apache CloudStack. We continue our leadership role in the development of open-source cloud management alternatives, working with both CloudStack and OpenStack. I've spoken before about the challenging setting at which we're operating. Customers are expanding the life of their assets and they are delaying purchases, while they evaluate new technologies. Recently, we have seen weakness in US federal IT spending. We do not see any near-term resolution to the low growth IT spending environment and our guidance reflects what we believe to be an appropriate level of conservatism. Nonetheless, we remain well positioned competitively as demonstrated by our strong gross margins and market share gains. According to IDC's Q3 calendar year '13 market share data, we gained over 1 point of share from Q3 a year ago, our fourth consecutive quarter of increasing year-over-year market share gains. I've also talked about our portfolio being the best ever, and I see that continuing. We have more products early in their lifecycle than ever before and continue to drive platform competitiveness with the solutions in our upcoming announcement. We expect to extend the lead of our diversified flash portfolio and broaden our partner ecosystem to hyperscale cloud providers in the coming quarters. We continue to innovate and partner in unique ways to create ongoing opportunity in an evolving IT ramp scale. Data growth is not slowing and the challenges of managing that data become more complex with the introduction of on-premise computing. The ubiquity of Data ONTAP and our partnering strategy uniquely position NetApp to support the long-term demands of IT organizations, as they evolve their delivery to a hybrid cloud model all managed with one set of tools to both on-premise and off-premise data. Regardless of the IT spending environment, we're confident in the strength of our innovation leadership and the ability to drive continued share gains and shareholder value. We see opportunity and growth in the emerging hybrid cloud environment. In wrapping up, I would like to thank the entire NetApp team for their execution intensity. We are making the right choices and remain focused on innovation and execution, which enables us to serve our customers and yield strong operational returns. Despite the challenging environment, we're generating operating leverage in our business model, supporting continued investment in innovation and yielding strong cash flow. I also want to congratulate the team for being recognized by FORTUNE as one the 100 Best Companies to Work For list for the 12th consecutive year. NetApp's unique culture is a differentiator that helps us drive innovation and enables our customers to achieve great outcomes. At this point, I'll open up the call for Q&A. As always, I ask that you be respectful of your peers on the call and limit yourself to one question, so we can address as many people as possible. Thank you. Operator? Operator : (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Jim Suva with Citi. Jim Suva - Citi: We all know that the federal government and the government spending has been pressured due to the critical reasons and the sequestration and things like that. Is there a bright point where you see they have a come back and spend regardless and are they just kind of wringing in the towel out as much as possible? And do you think that this is kind of the new go-forward rate at what we're doing right here? Tom Georgens : Time will certainly tell. But I think from our perspective, it certainly appears to be that the government is going to be in this state for a while. So I'm not in a position to say that I think they're going to bounce back in, in a week or month or a quarter or longer than that. So I think as we think about where we're going from here, I think we're basically assuming the situation that we're going to see, as there's going to be a tight spending across the board. So for us, obviously it makes next quarters compare and the Q1s compare, Q2s compare more challenging. And then assuming that has no change, that would start to normalize. But I think it would be imprudent of us to kind of bake in an expectation. I think they're going subtly snap back. I think our assumption baked into our numbers is that this is the environment we're going to see, it's going to be challenging, NetApp will win its disproportionate share, but I'm not expecting that thing to return to normal in the near term on the federal side. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Wittine with Longbow Research. Joe Wittine - Longbow Research : I wouldn't think federal is a hug impact there given just how weak the January quarter was. Is there anything else you could point to as far as what's happening in keeping this outlook? Nick Noviello : We actually missed the front-end of your question. So I'm going to ask you, was your question around branded growth for Q3 or around the outlook for Q4? Joe Wittine - Longbow Research : I was asking about just the outlook for the fourth quarter here, well below seasonal and it doesn't seem to me that federal should be a significant impact on a sequential basis, given just how weak the January quarter was for federal? So what else is going on? Nick Noviello : Well, let me first point out that last year, when we looked year-over-year for Q4, federal was down pretty substantially year-on-year. We've got to build in that overall federal environment into our thinking for Q4. And if you were to kind of look at the overall, our expectations for the branded side of the business for the quarter are probably about flattish. We also have some conservatism and pressure built on the OEM side. And we think that is appropriate, given one of our big OEM partners there is IBM and some of the dynamics going on in their business as an example, and the number of the OEM business, we're going to be dependent upon those parties, our OEM customers and the dynamics impacting them. So those are two areas where we think our level of conservatism is appropriate in terms of building that Q4 revenue guidance for you. Tom Georgens : The one thing I'd add to that is certainly the federal story is an issue, but that's not to say that the rest of the global market is everything is fine as well. And clearly, you see the guidance of our peers and the commentary of our peers. And we certainly see that as well. So I think all these things are factored in. So clearly, we've got a tough compare with the federal side. As Nick indicated, as we go forward into next quarter, also heading into the Q1s of both IBM and Teradata, two of our big OEM partners, clearly there's a sequential impact associated with that that we'll need to absorb. So I think all those things considered that there is not a lot of bright light. Broadly certainly we've got by virtue of having number one market share in the federal. We have an exposure that some of the other guys don't have. And likewise, we have OEM seasonality that's somewhat different than our own. And that's something else you need to factor into next quarter. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs. Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs : So you had another quarter of surprisingly strong gross margins, and I think that's very encouraging to see that persisting. But with that said, we're still not seeing similar performance in revenues, and I understand all the factors you mentioned, particularly the federal weakness. But is there any component here we're getting some of that if you have to walk away from more aggressive deals in the quarter at a more often that normal? How should we think about the pricing dynamic and whether or not you may be getting some revenue on the pay book and the strong gross margin? Tom Georgens : Well, I think overall, certainly we don't want to sacrifice any sales discipline here. But nonetheless, I think that it separates very competitive large deals and big accounts from the broader motion of the business. So I think in the broader motion of the business, we have a discipline about our pricing. I thin we've come a long way over the last year and training our field and our partners about the value proposition of clustered ONTAP. And if that becomes more mainstream, we see purchases there. I think the value proposition is exceptionally strong. So we feel certainly heartened by the strength of the gross margin now two quarters in a row. I don't think the rest of the industry has seen that. And I don't think that's a coincidence that that also coincides with much broader acceptance of clustered ONTAP. Now that said, I think on big transactions, which are either new accounts or complicated for any number of reasons, I don't think in this market we're walking away from those easily. So I think that we are going to pursue business. We are going to be aggressive to go after big deals. We are aggressively going after accounts. And in terms of the large opportunities, we're not walking away from too many of them on price, certainly no more than we have in the past. But I think broader discipline, better execution of the value proposition and better training of both our people and our channel partners have been a bigger contributor than that. Nick Noviello : Let me also expand on a couple of pieces, though, because when we look at really the progression of Q2 to Q3 to Q4, there is a couple of components to overall gross margin to take a look at. Aside on the services side of the fence for a second, on the services side of the fence, gross margins went up from Q2 to Q3. Our expectations would be that they are down a bit between Q3 and Q4. But in the services side, and we've had a little bit of this conversation before, here what we're doing is we're spending to build our infrastructure in a lot of cases. So sometimes, there is and in this quarter there was certainly a timeliness spend that was a little different than our original expectations that impacted the gross margins in the quarter and helped us drive that 2 point increase sequentially from Q2 to Q3. So we expect some of that to that timing of spend to come back into the system in Q4, right, so those margins will come down. And then on the product side, I think that is where you would see the impact of big deals, the impact of the elasticity. And we had expected a decline sequentially from Q2 to Q3 on the product gross margin side of the fence in the 1.5 point to 2 point range. Some of that is always due to mix, product mix, customer mix. We saw all of the things we expected, right? We offset that with real great execution in the business and realization of a lot of value there. So we really made up the difference on the product gross margin side. But just looking at overall gross margins, you really have to get under the covers to the two pieces, because there're different drivers for the two. And that point on pricing is really more of a product situation than it is a service gross margin. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research. Steven Fox - Cross Research : Just going back to a couple of comments you made in the prepared remarks, you talked about some spending delays or decision processes extending out around sort of evaluating new technology and preliminary models. Can you just expand on that, how much of that was new impact relative to what you thought and whether this is something that's going to abate in the next couple of quarters, or how do you think that plays out before that becomes a non-issue? Tom Georgens : Well, I think we see things that other people are seeing. We certainly see our IT budgets, particularly in the very large accounts under a fair amount of pressure. And the consequence of that is clearly that people are going to try and reduce their CapEx by using resources longer and higher utilization, perhaps see some of the storage efficiency features that they hadn't used in the past. The other side of it, though, I also believe that customers are looking at more technology choices like flash and they're also looking at delivery model options as well like cloud. And if you're in an investment cycle where you're looking at do I build another data center that (inaudible) regret that two years from now, I wish I had gone to the cloud and likewise and make a big investment in next version of software or something like that. So I think in the advent of cloud and FAS and new technologies, there's elongated decision cycles, because people don't want to make bets on technologies at a long term in nature that they're going to regret in a few years. So I certainly see that as people trying to figure out how to immigrate these new technologies, how do we integrate them into their work flows. While the cross-benefit they make or see (inaudible) and factor that all in. So there is no doubt that particularly in a cloud, I think it's slowing down decision cycles as people really slowed on how they can realistically deploy it in their environment. Is it any different than prior quarters? I think it's certainly a relatively new development. I would say it was dramatically different this quarter than prior quarters. But you definitely see it is that customers are somewhat reluctant to make very, very long-term commitment for rapidly changing technological environment. Operator : Our next question comes from Lou Miscioscia with CLSA. Lou Miscioscia - CLSA: My question is really on the same line of that is that when you look at service side flash with your flash competitors, cloud storage companies like AWS growing at 1 petabyte to 1.5 petabyte a day, cloud storage to an object storage, hasn't the environment changed, so we all should just be thinking about very low modest, let's say, 2% to 3% kind of organic growth for your branded business just going forward, because looking at the horizon, it doesn't really like they're going to change. I'm wondering if we should just really rethink or reset them, Tom? Tom Georgens : Well, clearly, we're in a low growth environment. I don't think we're going to basically subject ourselves to that type of questioning, because clearly the question that we have to go through is, is it different this time. And I think all of those things are factors. The kind of the things that I talked about, about elongating product lines, driving efficiencies, running at high utilization slow down decision processes, I think there is no doubt about that. But I think it's also fair to say that we also see they're somewhat close by going to the cloud. I think service side flash is much less of a factor, but I think the cloud is clearly the big disruptor in people's minds. And there's no doubt that their workloads make sense in the cloud. A lot of them tend to be temporary workloads. A lot of them tend to be proof-of-concept type workloads. And some of them are utilization workloads. But that said, when we talk to end users, I think the big question that people are facing is how do they broaden the appeal of those workloads and broaden the use of the cloud, which is a very, very complex data management issue. It isn't as simple as running in the cloud. It's how do I integrate that data to my workflow, how do I protect it. The data solution problems don't go away against the data moves. Our point of view is that we're not going to deny that data has gone to the cloud. So I believe that will depress somewhat the growth rate of the industry or some of the historical norms. They do. If I think it's 2% to 3%, I don't. I think data growth is just going to overpower that. So I still think that the growth rate in this industry is higher than that. But our challenge is recognize that data is going to go to cloud and the opportunity of or the needs of customers can manage that data well and protect that data, it always gets more acute. So our point of view is we've clustered ONTAP and Data ONTAP and manage that data in our hardware and other people's hardware, how those embrace the hyperscale. Just things like data private storage is they'd like to see more things from us along that line. I mean our challenge that we want to put to ourselves is how do we make it possible for customer for the use cases that makes sense to effectively and seamlessly integrate the cloud into their environment. And I think the person who does that ultimately wins the data management battle. And that really is the strength of our portfolio. We have the opportunity to create one data management framework and put all storage whether it's on-prem or off-prem, whether it's on our hardware or not. So is the cloud a factor? Sure. Is the cloud mainstream? No, it's not. And I think the one that enables customers to make it mainstream is going to be the winner in this race. Operator : Our next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley : Software entitlements and maintenance line impacts growth for, I think, the first time despite decent branded product growth over the last four or five quarters. Can you just talk about what drove that deceleration? Nick Noviello : If I look at the last 12 quarters, there's always going to be movement in those lines and essentially on that SEM line. That does come off the balance sheet, which means it is going to be dependent upon the lengths of contracts on the balance sheet, whether there's any large or lumpy contracts that are coming off over time and then what's going on. It's a combination of the two. So when I look back again over 12 quarters, sometimes it's flat, sometimes it's up dramatically. This is all timing. I would not get too much into that. But when you've got an overall business, when you have at this type of revenue rate, I appreciate the fact that you're going to look at some of those lines. But I think you've got to look at a lot of that's timing. Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley : Did you see any change in the lengths of contracts, a residual behavior in the January quarter? Nick Noviello : In terms of the overall contract license of what's in the balance sheet, there's no dramatic change there. These are tens and thousands of contracts, right, and you can think of it and massive Excel spreadsheet in terms of what the utilization of that looks like over time. And then during the quarter, we'll always have our fair share of. Renewal transactions of fair share is very large, multi-element transactions, all of that is in the mix. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Choi with Janney. Bill Choi - Janney: Tom, I want to continue the prior discussion you're having here on revenue versus margins. There was obviously a question about more elasticity. I want to take it to a different kind of angle to it and want to talk about reach here that you've completely refreshed your entire product line. So you might be benefiting from some upgrades, opportunities with existing partners. And yet, when we look back to last few years, you've had a lot more competition for the channel. Clearly, EMC has been a lot more aggressive and you still have all these new players like Pure, like Nimble getting some of your former partners or existing partners. So if you could kind of talk about it from that angle, reach, channel partner programs. Has anything changed materially in the last year or two that prevents you from really benefiting as the cycle comes back? Tom Georgens : No, if anything, the broader channel reach into the general territory has actually a much higher growth in our business and into major accounts. So I feel good about how we're going down that path. And as far as the smaller companies, certainly we see them. But at the end of the day, the overwhelming competitive engagement is with the traditional companies and logic companies that we hear about everyday. So from our perspective, I don't think the competitive landscape has changed. Certainly, some of them are carrying some of the smaller players into some of the mid-sized accounts. But I don't think that that's disrupting our momentum. In fact, you see our numbers on the indirect channels being as high this quarter as they have ever been despite the OEM roll-off. So I think I feel really good about our channel program. I think one of the things that happened this past quarter, particularly in relation to our ONTAP adoption, was that we saw a big jump in the 3000s. And what that looks like to me is a lot more breadth and breadth really comes from our channel partners. The other data points is in terms of new customer acquisition, which is also primarily driven by our channel partners, our new customer acquisition year-to-date has almost doubled what it was last year. So actually I feel good about the general territory. I feel good about the channels. I think as reported by a lot of other people, the larger accounts which [ph] apply more proxy from the macro is clearly where we're seeing more slow down. But our channel momentum is actually the bright part of the story, both in terms of the commercial channels. And state, local and higher ed actually had a very, very good quarter for us again. And that is 100% channel. Bill Choi - Janney: Are you still growing the number of your channel partners at this point? Tom Georgens : Probably not. I mean our number of channel partners in terms of people and the part of the program is measured in the thousands. What's more important for us is to make sure that those guys are well compensated, they're interested, they understand the value proposition. So we're not looking to add another 1,000 to a long list. We're looking to make the ones that are productive a lot more successful. And one of ours reported last quarter obviously a very, very strong quarter. So I think fewer better partners is probably a thing that we're really looking for, particularly with the clustered ONTAP transition, the expansion of our portfolio. And there's a lot of big opportunities for them to differentiate from our other partners and take us forward. Those are our top priorities. Bill Choi - Janney: Where are we on that transition and how long before you stabilize the number to what you think is ideal? Nick Noviello : I think that in the end, our channel program has to be measured against the opportunity and the return on investment. And that's the thing that we evaluate everyday. And I think it also varies country-by-country. I think overall, the channel program remained strong. And frankly, if our major accounts are going instead to our channel program, we'd be having a different conversation right now. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan. Mark Moskowitz - JPMorgan: Just want to come back to the topic around just kind of more muted revenue growth profile. Is this a function of maybe you guys are [ph] kind of bit with your success in terms of all these software advance, since now are just allowing or enabling customers to buy less? Less is more today and therefore your revenue content per deploying in for both new and legacy customers is decreasing, and could this be a continuing trend? Tom Georgens : Actually, I'll be firm in my disagreement with that. I think I can roll the clock back to the aftermath of the financial crisis and we had just introduced deduplication. We had conversations on this call about deduplication slowing your growth rate, because clearly the growth rate has come down. And the simple fact of the matter is if we had 99% market share in the customers themselves, we might have a different point of view, but we don't. So if you can give the customer a better solution and ultimately be clear and play more of their footprint, I think that helps us. And in the aftermath of that downturn, NetApp had a 30% organic growth here with the exact same technology. And I think the goodwill that we built, the new customer acquisition that we built along the way and the market share gains even in the tough environment that we accrued, I think paid off huge for us. So I think where we are today, I do believe that there is a limit. In other words, people can extend the life of the equipment for so long and eventually they need to go back to the normal growth rates on top of that. So I think there's a one-time expansion, which could depress the market. And I think we certainly see that over the last couple of years. But at its core, I still contend that just about every activity undertaken by mankind is generating cadence. So I think the generation of data is not changing. People are modulating the copies of the data with the big amount of growth in the industry, but that's got its consequences. And people are trying to use assets longer. So yeah, the utilization of asset life will slow down the growth of the market in the interim, but eventually it'll normalize. So coming back to the idea that this is the new normal that storage is going to grow at the rate of IT, there hasn't been the case historically certainly in the delivery models, but in the long run, I still believe that storage is inherently only going to increase and I think that this market will bounce back. Operator : Our next question comes from Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Kulbinder Garcha - Credit Suisse : Tom, I just want to go back to that last comment with respect to storage outperforming IT as well as maybe utilization rising. I guess you guys have a lot of systems out there. Do you guys measure storage and utilization? I'm trying to understand how high some of your (inaudible) will be pushing that, because the one thing that is clear is storage has historically has outperformed IT, just hasn't probably in the last year, year-and-a-half. I'm wondering whether you've got any tangible evidence as opposed to anecdotes when customers just tell you where utilization might be? Just with respect to OpEx savings and cost savings, you're put in this subdued revenue environment. When that can become more aggressive on the cost base and could we have a restructuring, do you think? Tom Georgens : I'll answer the first question in terms of the protracted nature. I mean if you look at IT, it's protracted against pretty much all categories. I do believe that there're other categories that are getting funded in this environment. Certainly security is the top of mind concern for every CIO that I speak to. So I think within a constrained environment and maybe some competing platforms that we might not have had in the past, but the other change of fact is storage is growing. It's a consumable. And I expect that storage to outgrow IT. I expect that trend to come back. In terms of metrics in the field, I hate to report the metrics that I got to get held to every time. Certainly, equipment-wise, it's extending. I think that there's no debate about that. In terms of utilization rates, we do have some data on that, but obviously that depends on a whole bunch of categories in terms of use cases, product platform, in that nature. But there's no doubt that equipment life is extending. And you see it in the form of, as Nick talked earlier, length of first-time service contracts and the number of renewals as opposed to tech refreshes (inaudible). Nick Noviello : First of all, we're going to be and we've continued to note that we're very conscious on the spending side. I think we're also really quite proud of the work that broad organization has done whether it be in supply chain or many different pieces of the operations in ensuring we're getting the biggest returns for the dollars spent, whether that's in the channel or in the manufacturing side or across the board. I think we're really quite pleased with that. And we're going to keep that focus. And I think that is going to part of and continues to be part of the reality. Our job is to just find the areas of investments that will yield the biggest return and make those investments fair. Our job is also to look at those areas that aren't yet yielding return or where we think that the investment is outside to the return and direct accordingly. So I can't answer a question specifically on what actions we will take at any one point in time, because we take actions and make decisions everyday. But being conscious of our cost and being conscious of where our investments are directed, that's part of our day-to-day and we should continue to expect that. Tom Georgens : The one thing I'd add on that subject is in clearly a tough environment that we're particularly pleased with is we did restructuring last year and it was painful and it should be. And it's not something that we're happy about doing. But in parallel with that, we took a very, very serious effort about the rest of the cost structure on the cost side and things of that nature. And I think tha the improvement in gross margin is the culmination from very, very important activities that we did there. So in a very tough environment, we see NetApp gross margins go up, and I don't think that's been the trend of either our competitors or more broadly in the IT industry. And NetApp is the company that also generated expansion of operating margin in a very, very difficult environment as well. So I think our execution intensity is way up. I think we're committed to make the decisions that are necessary to generate shareholder return and the long-term health of the company. But I should also add that I do expect this industry to come back, that we're not going to sacrifice investment that we believe is going to create competitive advantage for us, that's going to sacrifice our position going forward. The market share numbers are really strong. And while the topline numbers aren't great, I mean it's four consecutive quarters of increasing market share gain in the IDC numbers, and that's a sign of winning. And the confidence is high. And we don't want to let that go just because of going through a tough period that we think will ultimately lapse. So I think we made some hard decisions, we made some painful decisions. The execution tends to be as high. But we're not going to sacrifice the investments that we think are going to enhance our competitive position going forward and jeopardize our ability to capture the return in this market. Operator : Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital. Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital : Just really more of a clarification on your gross margin comments in the prepared remarks. I think guys mentioned, Nick, you would eventually pass the efficiency gain through product margins to pricing over time. And just want some context on that. Should we expect gross margins to begin to decrease now? There's some of that that's sort of implied in your April 2 guidance. Nick Noviello : First of all, when I gave guidance 90 days ago, we talked about the product gross margins in Q2 and some of the savings and our expectation that those would pass through in Q3 and in fact they did, right. So that is something we're going to be doing. There's always a bit of timing lapse that we have to work through, but we recognize savings in Q2 will pass some of those savings through in Q3. We recognized even more savings in Q3. We're going to pass through some of those in Q4. It's just timing and I think it goes back to the really, really strong efforts around execution and operational excellence that are going on here. So yes, the guidance that we gave on gross margin would imply a lower product gross margin in Q4 than in Q3. That is a result of some of the pass-through. If I go look over time between Q3 and Q4 over some years, there is a reasonable sort of downtick in product gross margin. So none of that should be unexpected. Tom Georgens : Yeah, overall, I think using some gross margin and generating some growth, attracting some strategic accounts, that's a trade-off we make frankly. I think more broadly if I look at our channel business and our general territory business in the transactions, I think we're doing well there from both the gross margin perspective. So I wouldn't basically give that up. But nonetheless, there's no choice of ugly deals to pursue, particularly if we're making into new accounts and those are of keen interest to us. And we've doing that we're doing that all along despite the gross margin rise. But if saw opportunities around competitive take-out opportunities or opening up new accounts that had high growth potential for us, we're certainly willing to use gross margin to make that happen. Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital : Is there are a normalized gross margin that you think is reasonable? Nick Noviello : I think we kind of gave our long-term model in terms of gross margin, and we're certainly at the high end of that. But I think we need to move on to next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Technology Insights. Nehal Chokshi - Technology Insights : So on the US Commercial, that was down 3% year-over-year, and I understand that federal came in below expectation and that OEM has also been in pressure. But compared to prior two quarters, Commercial is up 8%. So I'm trying to figure out why isn't the (inaudible) reversal and the year-over-year growth trajectory for that segment there? Tom Georgens : Yeah, I agree. I think I said that earlier. I think if I look at this quarter and the delta from a new point of guidance, I think we can put that in the context of central business both in terms of barely grew as fast as (inaudible) of the other territories or the nominal 10% of our total revenue, it's in the 9% like they were this year, 10% last year. Both of those explain all of the difference. But going forward, I think that the more general IT trends that you see reported from other people, we're not immune to that either and we're seeing that in all the geographies. So I don't want to say that the difference between normal seasonality and where we're guiding is all about federal. Certainly federal isn't helping and we don't expect it to come back. The OEM is a factor. And I think that's on the trajectory. But I think that the rest of the major markets are still challenging. And I don't seem them improving. I mean we had some bright spots in some of our emerging markets. China was especially strong for us, but it's just not enough to offset the major market. So if I look at the numbers, US Commercial down 3%, that's clearly a downtick from where we were last quarter. That's factored into where we are going forward. I don't believe that and certainly nobody in NetApp believes that that's a competitive dynamic. I think we're seeing what other people see. That in fact our numbers are going to affect our guidance. I think that's a conservatism that we don't give. Federal is clearly a factor, but I think we can see some downtick broadly in the major markets as well. Nehal Chokshi - Technology Insights : But what's the reason for that downtick in the major markets? Tom Georgens : I think it's all the other dynamics. You watch the IT spending numbers estimates come down and down and down. And I think we see that. One thing about storage is we can talk about the snap back and storage and storage and consumable and we're generating a lot of storage. But storage spending is still up the umbrella of IT spending. And we don't sit around this Board table and say, boy, I wish we could spend money on R&D, but we can't, because I can't buy more storage. Those conversations don't happen. Basically there's an IT budget that's set. Storage I think will over time get a disproportion amount of it, but doesn't change the fact that storage is still very, very highly pricey with overall IT spend. As IT spend comes down, it comes down with it. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi with Lake Street. Eric Martinuzzi - Lake Street : Given that we did $787 million last fiscal year and I'm tracking to a little under $600 million this year, are we in that zone where we can say it does start to flatten out? Or given the declines, it's still too soon to tell? Tom Georgens : I think the IBM story, I mean it's roughly flat last two quarters. And I think that we've been guiding towards flattening out. IBM is a big mover in that storage, certainly over the last two years. The IBM component of that, I think we've been very upfront with that. And I would say that IBM is kind of gliding into the range that we expected of them. But although we don't have a direct knowledge, certainly there's a lot of decisions going on in IBM that could either help us or hurt us. So I think there's some uncertainty around that might not have six months ago. But I think that the trajectory thereon is very much in line of what we guided to. And I do see that kind of settling in. And the other partners of that community have all been good. And that's that. So if I look at branded E-Series both the all-flash EF and non-EF E-Series on the branded side, it's actually growing even faster. And I said on the prior call and I stand by that we're looking for aggregate E-Series, both branded plus OEM to be a growth business for us next year. So we're actually excited about that combination. Eric Martinuzzi - Lake Street : But kind of in this minus-20% to minus-25%, and that seems like it's tied to the Q4 guidance. Is that roughly accurate? Nick Noviello : If you're talking about the OEM for Q4, what we mentioned earlier is that our Q4 is the Q1 for the OEM. That's going to put pressure on that business. If you look at last year between Q3 and Q4, the sequential down was 18%. So the type of math you're doing could absolutely be there. We've got be aware of that dynamic. So certainly, we're being conservative in what we expect from OEM. Operator : Our next question comes from Rajesh Ghai with Macquarie. Rajesh Ghai - Macquarie: Given that the move to the hybrid is inevitable for enterprise IT and you seem to be finding some success going into the hybrid cloud as well the public cloud or service model verticals, I was just wondering does your model change over time and how long would that be? Do you see a potential for gross margin to increase or you are not going to see any benefit out of that? And also related to that, I was wondering if you could begin sharing some specific revenue metrics so that we can gauge your progress in these new verticals? Tom Georgens : Yeah, I think over time, clearly we've had a service provider vertical for a while. And over the past year, US Commercial market has been our best performer. So I think we continue to do that. More broadly, within the hyperscale, there is a likelihood that hyperscale is finding a standard product and deploying it. I think it's probably remote. I think certainly we'll pursue IT discussions with them that may or may not yield anything. But in the end, where we are right now, I need to see us ranking number one in capacity of storage in the public cloud. So I think our service provider program is working quite well for us. I think in the end game, it's a move that and make that more mainstream and make it integrated into the key flow of key business applications for customers. And these are the seamless integration of on-prem and off-prem computing. And if you think about it, in order to use the service providers, also the hyperscalers, if data could be managed and protected and backed up and organized and archived all with one data management tool, that would be really compelling. And really that is the push that we're on to the next level. And that is rather than fighting the cloud and debating the relevance of a cloud, I think similar to our deduplication conversation of five years ago, and that is if we embrace the cloud and make it possible for customers to use it, the likelihood of a greater standardization deployment of our data management across the enterprise goes up. And if we're writing more data and controlling more data with our data management and the opportunity to add more value through software, it also goes up. So from our perspective, I do believe that hybrid cloud is very much in its early days. But if there was ever a technology in this world that could expand on-premise computing and off-premise computing and likewise multiple hardware, it'd be ONTAP. We already have ONTAP that runs in B-Series, that runs on other people's software. We have ONTAP that runs on other people's hardware. We have ONTAP on virtual machine that runs generic hardware. The ability to basically go up-prem and bring that into Data ONTAP and Data ONTAP's management tools, I think it's a compelling value for our position. I think one that really nobody else can realistically claim. And from my perspective, that is the epitomy of software-defined storage is one enterprise data management that can manage any storage whether it's on our hardware or not or whether it's on-premise or not. And that's the thing that we're going after in the long term. In the meantime, where we are now, if you look at the market share numbers, I think the team feels like we're winning. I think we're gaining share. It's a tough environment and the sense is that if we're continuing to gain share that when this thing downstack and I believe it will, then we'll be in position better than ever. I really feel good about long-term strategy around hybrid cloud. I think that's something we're uniquely capable of delivering. And that in the current state, I think we're in the private and the public cloud with the service providers. And I think if you look at the market share, we're winning our premise well. And really E-Series is in its early days. We have flash array. So it's a jungle out there and I wish we had one topline growth to show for it. But I think we're doing the right things. I think we're winning against any competitors. And I think we feel confident about our ability to continue to innovate into the future. I think we need to move on. So thank you very much. Thank you all for joining us today and look forward to talking to you all again in another 90 days. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

In a moment, Nick will walk you through some additional color on our financial results, and then Tom will give you his perspective on the business this quarter. I'll now turn the call over to Nick. Nick Noviello :  Thank you, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. NetApp delivered another quarter of solid financial performance, driven by our innovative portfolio solutions, competitive positioning and strong operational execution. We achieved Q4 revenue inside our prior guidance range and non-GAAP gross margin, operating margin and EPS all above Q4 guidance ranges. Before discussing our fiscal 2014 results and future expectations, I'd like to first provide more detail on our performance in the fourth quarter. Net revenues of $1.65 billion were up 2% sequentially, but down 4% year-over-year. Branded revenue grew 6% sequentially, and as expected was relatively flat on a year-over-year basis. OEM revenue declined further than expected and was down 30% from Q3 and 34% from Q4 last year. Indirect revenues through the channels and OEMs accounted for 83% of Q4 revenue consistent with the last two quarters. Arrow and Avnet contributed 24% and 17% of net revenue respectively. Non-GAAP gross margin of 64.4% was almost a point better than Q3 and above our previous guidance. Non-GAAP product gross margin of 58% was up almost one point sequentially and two points year-over-year due to a combination of continued operational productivity, favorable product mix and lower hardware warranty costs. Non-GAAP service gross margin of 62.7% was up almost two points sequentially and more than six points year-over-year due to higher support revenue and lower spending partially related to delayed projects as well as lower headcounts related to realignment actions. Non-GAAP operating margin of 20.9% was above our previous guidance range driven by a combination of higher gross margins and lower operating expenses resulting from the realignment action we took mid quarter. We made the realignment decision to accelerate key strategic initiatives, while at the same time streamlining certain elements of the business such as OEM. Overall, this action resulted in a headcount reduction of approximately 4% and a GAAP restructuring charge of approximately $39 million in the quarter. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.84 was up 22% year-over-year and was $0.02 over the high-end of our prior guidance range. This reflects solid operational performance as well as an approximate $0.01 net benefit from the combination of realignment activities and lower share counts, partially offset by a higher Q4 effective tax rate versus prior guidance. Q4 weighted average diluted share counts of 336 million shares decreased by almost 10 million shares from Q3 due to repurchase activity throughout the quarter. Cash and balance sheet metrics for Q4 remains strong. Free cash flow of $313 million was 19% of net revenue. Inventory turns were at 19 and days sales outstanding increased to 47, reflecting typical seasonality. Deferred revenue was up $141 million versus Q3 and up $91 million from Q4 last year. Finally, we repurchased approximately $374 million of stock and paid $49 million in cash dividend during the quarter. Now turning to fiscal year 2014, I would characterize the year in much the same way as I characterize Q4. Solid financial performance based on innovation leadership, robust operational execution and strong competitive positioning. Throughout the year we introduced new solutions that enable customers to solve their challenges today while providing them with an innovative architecture for tomorrow. For the fiscal year, net revenues of $6.33 billion were flat from fiscal year 2013. Branded revenue was up 4% that was offset by lower OEM revenue, which was down 26%. Including the impact of lower OEM revenue, geographic revenues in EMEA and Asia-Pacific were up slightly, offset by lower revenue in the Americas, which was due to challenges in U.S. Federal spending. Full year non-GAAP gross margin was 63.2%, up 2.5 points from fiscal 2013, and non-GAAP operating margin was 18.3%, up three points from fiscal 2013. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the year was 17.2%, slightly above our prior guidance and fiscal 2013, reflecting the impact of our geographical sales mix and year end true-ups. Non-GAAP EPS for fiscal 2014 was $2.78, up 22% from fiscal year 2013. We ended the year with a strong balance sheet and a continued high degree of financial flexibility to invest in the business and enhanced value of the shareholders. We closed fiscal 2014 with approximately $5 billion in cash in short-term investments, approximately 14% of which is onshore. Over the course of the year we generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow and fully executed our capital allocation strategy, which included retiring just under $1.3 billion in convertible notes and returning $2.1 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. As expected, we ended this fiscal year with approximately $1.1 billion remaining in our share repurchase program. Today we are pleased to announce an increase in our next dividend to $0.165 per share to be paid on July 22. This represents a 10% increase compared to Q4 and reflects our confidence in the business, our consistent ability to generate healthy domestic cash flow and our ongoing commitment to generating shareholder value. Now to guidance; we expect our Q1 target revenues to range between $1.42 billion and $1.52 billion which at the midpoint implies a sequential decline of approximately 11% and a 3% decrease year-over-year. This sequential decline reflects our typical Q4 to Q1 seasonal revenue dynamics as well as conservatism around OEM business in light of our Q4 results and our future expectations given the business conditions impacting certain OEM customers. With that said we expect to continue to drive strong operational performance and prudently manage expenses. In Q1 we expect to generate consolidated non-GAAP gross margins of approximately 63.5 to 64%, and non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 15%. Based on our stock repurchases in Q4 and in the first 10 days of Q1, we expect our diluted share counts for the quarter to decline to approximately 332 million shares and non-GAAP earnings per share for Q1 to range from approximately $0.53 to $0.58 per share. Overall as we look at fiscal year 2015, NetApp remains well positioned to help customers navigate through their hybrid cloud strategies with market-leading scale out and converged solutions. We remain confident in our strategy and committed to enhancing shareholder value over the long-term. For the year, we anticipate mid single-digit branded revenue growth ramping over the course of the year and partially offset by declines in OEM revenue of up to 40%. They're ultimately dependent on revenue mix and growth. We expect fiscal 2015 gross margin of approximately 63 to 64% and operating margin of approximately 18%. As I mentioned last quarter, we are implementing a change in how we report our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be more reflective of our operational results and tax structure and to provide a better comparison with our peers. For the year, we currently expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate under this new methodology to be approximately 16.5%. Finally, we intend to accelerate our current share repurchases program and to complete it over the course of the next 12 months, a year earlier than originally announced. Bottom line, our plans for fiscal 2015 translate to just under 10% growth in earnings per share and continued strong cash flow generation. With that, I will turn the call over to Tom for more detail on the business momentum. Tom? Tom Georgens :  Thanks, Nick, and good afternoon, everyone. I'm pleased with our operational execution again this quarter. We delivered revenue within our guidance range, while expanding gross in operating profit margins to levels among the highest in the history of the company, all despite unanticipated headwinds in our OEM business. In calendar 2013 we outgrew the market, gained share and increased gross margins, demonstrating our competitive advantage and the value we deliver. With the steep ramp of Clustered ONTAP, the acceleration of our broad flash portfolio and our differentiated approach to the cloud, we are participating in a greater range of customer engagements than in any time in our history. As we've discussed before, customers have choice in new technology and IT delivery options that enable them to modernize and create compelling business outcomes that were not previously possible. A particular impact is the cloud, which offers a degree of flexibility; and for certain workloads, economic benefits that cannot be achieved with traditional on-premises computing.  : One of the biggest challenges to this vision is data management. While other parts of the infrastructure are largely fungible and carry no history, once data is created, it needs to be protected and managed for its lifetime. As data grows data and application mobility become increasingly bandwidth and time consuming. The net result is that data management, NetApp's core competency is absolutely essential in the realization of the promise of the hybrid cloud. Data ONTAP, the number one storage operating system in the world already delivers the industry's richest data management portfolio and Clustered ONTAP is unmatched in meeting IT transformation requirements of both the enterprise and service providers. It is the only enterprise scale at the SAN platform. It is more reliable and easier to manage than other scale on NAS solutions and is able to consistently support multiple workloads with multi tenant management and performance scaling across disk, flash and hybrid storage. On our Q4 call last year, we talked about the complex development transition to Clustered Data ONTAP being behind us. Over the course of fiscal year '14 we saw a increasing momentum as customers and partners learned about the value of Clustered ONTAP and began deploying it broadly. For the full year fiscal year '14 clustered notes grew 242% from fiscal year '13. The attach rate of Clustered ONTAP increased across all of our product lines with high end platforms approaching 50% in Q4. Most notably the attach rate of our new FAS8000 product line was over 60%. To-date we have shipped over one Xobite of storage managed by Clustered ONTAP systems. With hybrid cloud as the dominant paradigm, on-premise's IT is not going away. However, due to budget constraints the customer's ability to evaluate, integrate and ultimately deploy solutions is being impacted. This trend is driving a demand that convert solutions that reduce the time of deployment and lower integration risk. By working with other best of breed hardware and software providers, we can offer a compelling business value with reduced risk in ways that cannot be matched by the proprietary staffs at the server vendors. Our strategic partnership at Cisco around FlexPod Solutions delivers on this promise, and we said FlexPod unit shipments grow 71% from Q4 of last year. With over 18 petabytes of flash sold last quarter, NetApp is the leader in the flash market with the best position portfolio both in terms of what is available today and what is coming. We are seeing multiple use cases emerging with different requirements balancing price, performance and features. One of the clearest examples is database acceleration. We are seeing rapid adoption in database environments using the EF all-flash array where data management is done by the application. Given the high end nature of these workloads, exceptional performance and availability are necessary. The latter requirement frequently disqualifies the less mature new entrance to the market. We frequently see EF systems in front of frame arrays sometimes actually replacing them. We are very confident in the competitive position of the EF both now and in the future. A second less clear set of use cases are those that have to be served by more fully featured flash arrays as customers balance the performance and power saving advantages with the higher cost of flash media. We are seeing some traction highly compressible, less mission critical workloads like BDI. As mentioned in our last call, we are seeing increased deployment of all-flash FAS arrays with Clustered ONTAP. A customer can create an all-flash node within a cluster and use transparent volume migrations and move less active data to lower cost media as the data ages. Or a customer can distribute the flash throughout the cluster to effectively produce a scale out multi protocol hybrid or all-flash solution. These are capabilities that no other vendor offers and we expect adoption to accelerate with the introduction of our newly refreshed high performance controller platforms. Units shipped of the EF family grew more than 3000% and all-flash FAS units increased 80% from Q4 a year ago. Beyond the strong growth of the EF family the branded E-Series products also grew nicely. E-Series units shipped exclusive of the EF products grew more than 170% from Q4 of last year. Our high end FAS shipments grew 8% year-on-year. Mid range FAS systems shipped were roughly flat, and interest expense we're down 18%. In Q4 we introduced the FAS8000 product line, our first generation of clustered optimized systems. We are very pleased with the performance of the new products and have the fastest initial quarter ramp of any systems in our history. Soon you can expect us to refresh the remainder of the FAS product line. In past calls I've discussed a difficult environment which we are operating in. Budgets are compressed; customers are expending the life of their assets and delaying purchases while evaluating new technologies. In a constrained environment we must hone our competitive edge and capture more than our fair share of the opportunities. With the re-architected Clustered ONTAP the introduction of the EF, the ramp of the E-Series and the promise of flash array, we are participating in opportunities that would not have previously been available to us. We also need to be sure we are investing in the technologies that will be industry leading as the market transitions and new architectures emerge. Our recent realignment was specifically intended to direct our resources towards our biggest opportunities. Our investments in the integration of cloud services and open source solutions into our software-defined data management framework uniquely position us to enable our customers to operationalize the cloud and other new emerging technologies. We expect our branded revenue growth to once again outpace that of the total industry in fiscal year '15 with solid gross margins and strong cash flow. Before opening the call for Q&A I'd like to thank the entire NetApp team for their hard work and dedication. We are focused on innovation and execution, which enables us to meet the evolving needs of our customers and we've strong operational returns. In a challenging environment we are generating operating leverage in our business model supporting continued investment and innovation and yielding strong cash flow. At this point, we will open up the call for Q&A. As always I ask that you be respectful of your peers on the call and limit yourself to one question, so we can address as many people as possible. Thank you. Operator? Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Alex Kurtz from Sterne Agee. Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee : Yeah. Sorry about that guys; I was on mute. Tom, can you just talk about how you see the next fiscal year playing off us around channels in our pipeline whether it's refreshes of new products, new verticals that you are attacking? I think people are looking at the branded product guide for the year and trying to understand how do you get to that number and sort of where you are sort of seeing that play off from a seasonality perspective and new products we expect to have come to the market next phase six to 12 months? Tom Georgens : Yeah, I think as you look at the market overall, clearly that's a challenging environment as you talked about. We see people extending the life of their assets, and if you take assets from a three or four year life to a four or five year life, that's a pretty big hold on growth rate of market, and I think we are clearly seeing that. There is a couple of things that I think that are specific to us as well. We have a very, very strong federal business. We are number one in market share there. And clearly with the shutdown at the end of the fiscal year, we didn't have that at the beginning of last year. So I think we got top of Q1 and Q2 compared on the federal side of the business that ultimately will age off. So I think overall we will take a tailwind if we get it, but I don't think anybody is predicting that at this point in time. We are going to try and competing within the market that we are at. But if I look at the business overall, certainly the OEM were disappointing in this quarter and looking forward with the uncertainty and lack of visibility we have deep into those businesses, I think we are just trying to take that down, so we don't have any more surprises and focus on the branded business. The branded business was up 4% year-over-year last year. And if I look at our portfolio whether it would be the ramp of Clustered ONTAP it would still relatively early days a year ago. If I look at how far we come with EF from effectively a standing start to a compelling position in the market, I think the field is embracing E-Series in a meaningful way that they weren't doing a year ago. And flash only on the way and the other thing is you will hear more about our software-defined and cloud story at Analyst Day, but sharing that with customers I think people view that very, very positively and see that as a reduction of risk by NetApp (indiscernible). So I think that we've got a set of things even independent in the macro around us that we did not have in our toolkit a year ago. And while we have some tough comparison on the federal side and I don't think anybody is expecting a miraculous turnaround in overall spending, I just think our competitiveness is that much better. And I think that we can leverage those into growth. And like I said in the aggregate we did 4% branded growth this year. So I believe while we are on the side that's really going to be challenging. We want to take that down, so we can stop talking about it for the time being. And the real focus is those OEM businesses that are still growing and likewise primarily around the branded. And that's why we broke out the OEM comparison all along because we knew we would be on this downward trend and we will focus on the go-forward businesses. Nick Noviello : And Alex, this is Nick, just a follow up on you asked a little bit on seasonality on that branded side of business. We expect that seasonality even for the Q1 to be pretty consistent with what we've talked about in the past, and as I indicated this ramps over the course of the year. We will go through -- Tom talked about federal in Q2, go through year end in Q3 and a ramp up in Q4, but pretty normal in terms of certainly with the Q4 to (indiscernible) branded side and then ramping through the year. Alex Kurtz - Sterne Agee : All right. Thanks, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Joe Wittine from Longbow Research. Joe Wittine - Longbow Research : Hi, thanks. The question is on the service provider business, EMC recently came out and framed up the size of the infrastructure, they are selling to cloud SPEs. I think it would be effective kind of lifting the curtain and easing investor concerns on the overall cloud risks. I know you referenced the third-party data in the past, saying you are number one, but are you willing to kind of frame up the relative size of that business for you and really the world of opportunity going forward as well? Tom Georgens : Well, I think that there is plenty of cloud business definitions out there. We had a vertical market around the service provider community which includes the TELCOs and the traditional service providers. And in fact that's been the fastest growing segment for us. On prior calls we talked about 200 service provider customers and a number of applications that we run there. And so the service provider, you are seeing the data NetApp number one in storage for the public cloud. But are we used to go actually beyond that into the hyperscalers and it doesn't certainly mean that we are going to sell the hyperscaler systems, but the hyperscalers are offering capability that's attracting to our customer set. And what you usually expect to see from NetApp as we rollout, we talked about our strategy is how do we enable customers to realize the benefits of that? How do we enable them to create a seamless extension of their on-premise computing? So, for us the data management component and the software component that is key and I think in some ways that's effectively the ultimate in unified stores just the ability to create an opportunity to seamlessly extend our data management whether it's on our systems or other people's systems whether it's not a private storage in conjunction with Amazon or whether it's actually in the cloud. So from our point of view is that all of those are components as the traditional sell-through of the service providers that are providing enterprise services and therefore big consumers of commercial equipment. And I think our position there speaks for itself and like I said even last year in a tough market that was our fastest growing segment. And then beyond that we are also looking to embrace the hyperscalers into our data management framework. So all of those components of the cloud both the traditional service providers and the hyperscalers are integral to our overall strategy. Operator : The next question comes from Brent Bracelin from Pacific Crest Securities. Brent Bracelin - Pacific Crest : Tom, I wanted to follow up on the strategy side specifically. What's your appetite -- risk appetite to diversify the portfolio, accelerate growth through M&A? And the reason why I ask you generated over a billion dollars in cash flow over the last four years. And each of the last four years you have over $4 billion in cash net of debt, but if I look at that OEM partnering strategy that business has been cut in half, now to $440 million kind of run rate. Your branded business has grown 3% or 4% over the last couple of years, but again has benefited from a tailwind around a new product cycle. So a question here, what's the strategy, the plan that kind of stays the course with what you are doing or are you thinking about different ways to accelerate growth diversify the portfolio through M&A given the strong cash flows, given the cash that you have on your balance sheet. Tom Georgens : Yeah. I think first on the OEM side, I think one thing to bear in mind on the OEM is probably two facts. One is while we talk about the OEM business and the OEM business declined there is multiple components to that. Part of that is E-Series, but there is also N-Series which is the old ONTAP based products for the IBM relationship which is on a similar trajectory, so the OEM business discussions and specifically in E-Series discussion. On the other hand the branded side of E-Series brought with us the capability to be in the position that we are in with all-flash arrays. In the aggregate you see our flash number, so we are very, very happy with that and likewise the momentum of the E-Series. And the thing I point out on the EF and the E-Series is the nature of the business that we are competing for and winning there. We in the majority -- the overall majority case we would not have been competing for how we not have those products in our portfolio. So we are very excited about the E-Series component of the portfolio from a technology perspective as we ever have, and clearly the OEM business, we are on a trajectory that it's on. And clearly we are breaking up that separately anticipating the trajectory that it would be moving albeit to stay a step down was a bit of a surprise. To be more complete on the M&A side, clearly I think we are open to opportunities that are going to drive the growth of the company. I think that we are looking for deals that are executable that are obviously affordable that's shipped within our core competency that we can bring value to that by virtue of having it in our portfolio we can add value to the business and ultimately they are going to drive growth. So I think in a transitioning market whether there is a lot of new technologies and a lot of new alternatives for customers, there is a lot of properties out there to look at. So to answer your question I am not going to signal any intention of any timeframe or any targets. I am surprised to say we understand the dynamics, we understand what customers are thinking and for the right transactions we'd be very much inclined to do M&A. Brent Bracelin - Pacific Crest : That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley : Yes, thanks. DSOs would suggest that it was a backend loaded quarter and others have talked about a stronger April relative to the calendar first quarter. Just curious whether you saw that April strength and if that could possibly deliver some surprise in the July quarter relative to your seasonal guidance. Nick Noviello : Katy, sure, DSOs at 47 days were a little higher than they were in Q4 of last year. It does talk to certain elements of the business happening towards the end of April, it's all current. So we have no concerns on those and no concerns on collectability. In terms of the guidance again that guidance is based on bottom up, so we do across the business, across the geographies, across the OEMs and bottom up for Q1. So I would point out that what we talked about before that sequential view of Q4 to Q1 is pretty consistent with what we have done in the past. We've remained conservative on the OEM side on top of it, which we think is appropriate given how Q4 went and given the position of some of the OEM partners. And I think the guidance stands and I don't think there is anything to suggest that it should be higher than what we've put out there to you at this point. And the DSOs again are just an element of the business and there is strong execution happening already in Q1 with respect to bringing in all of that cash. Tom Georgens : Another point I'd add is that this tends to be a highest DSO quarter of the year, so we are up substantially from the prior quarter. It's up from the prior year, but not as much as the few days, so four or five days. Yeah, there tend to be the cyclicality of the business. But I wouldn't try and read anything into the DSO and second guess our guidance. Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian White from Cantor Fitzgerald. Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald : Yeah, just a couple of things, number one could you talk a little bit about the relationship with Cisco and ACI was obviously and also inner cloud that was a big deal at Cisco Live this week. I know you are part of it, their announcements around it. So maybe how do you think that will play out? And just Nick, around operating margins, it seems like there is a much steeper drop in this Q1 on operating margins and we saw last year we had a similar revenue follow up, so maybe you can address that. Thank you. Tom Georgens : Yeah. I think general on many fronts. We continue to collaborate with Cisco. So certainly the ACI, the inner cloud obviously continued with FlexPods and other things around some other initiatives, OpenStack. So we continue to actually need to be, and continues to be a very multi-faceted relationship. So, in our relation with them I think it's all systems at go. I think we are finding more and more ways to engage. As far as inner cloud and ACI, clearly those are top initiatives for them. So I think being connected to them, being part of messaging, being part of private offering and part of their customer discussion is really important to us. So I think -- although I think Cisco is pushing pretty hard and I think that collaboration with NetApp is working really well. I think we continue to have momentum where we talked about FlexPod shipments being up 71% year-over-year. So I think -- so very, very much alive and well. And in fact now with ACI and inner cloud I think we just had an appearance with them this week at the Cisco Live Event. Nick Noviello : Yeah, I think the other point I would make on the in terms of the sequential here, I talked about the sequential revenue declines and when I go back a couple of years and there were sequential revenue declines from Q4 to Q1 of intimate teams. Last year it was 12% which is Q4 '13 to Q1 '14. Those will carry with them, a decline in operating margin of the company, all of them were. We also have gotten some benefits in the fourth quarter from our repositioning activity that we did and quarterly talked about that in terms of the earnings. We will start reinvesting those that's a reallocation activity. So that's all baked into the change the difference in operating margins from Q4 of '14 to Q1 of '15. So I don't think there is anything outside of that. We are balancing investment, we are balancing returns from the business and we are balancing sequential revenue decline that we typically expect from Q4 to Q1. Tom Georgens : Yeah, in fact we are -- if we go through the guidance we are actually guiding above where we were a year ago and that promising the same trajectory to see we are at almost 21 points at this point by now. So clearly there is seasonality. We think gross margin of the business obviously the revenue fall through the bottom line is actually quite large, so as the revenue is volatile so is the bottom line. So yeah, it's a transition from Q4 to Q1, I get that, but if you do the year-over-year compare I think it leads us in a position to deliver on next full year commitment. Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald : Great, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Kaushik Roy from Wunderlich. Kaushik Roy - Wunderlich: Hi, Tom. So can you help us understand why the traditional storage system vendors IBM, EMC and others start to see negative revenue growth whereas the new hybrid vendors such as (indiscernible) growing so rapidly? Is it because they have a new architecture that's superior? Alternatively does NetApp need to build something from the ground up? Tom Georgens : Well, I think that obviously you have got much, much different scale. You've got install base. There is a whole bunch of dynamics that separate the smaller players from the bigger players. And when I look at this I mean those cover a fair amount of ground in terms of use cases. I think there are some of those technologies there that are outside of our current space if we were to participate organically we would have to start from scratch, but in the storage systems market, if anything I'd use flash as an example. We certainly heard a lot of this start from scratch new technology, everything we knew about the past is no longer relevant and here we are with EF in a very, very strong position, in a very, very well defined segment of flash. And then likewise I think the ability to deploy flash not necessarily as a standalone point product, but as a nod in a cluster with all of the data management and the volume migration and all of that that goes with it, it's a pretty compelling offering. So we've heard this, do I need to start from scratch and certainly if it's not in a business that we are currently in the answer to that is yes. And the businesses that we are in if I actually look at where the momentum lies in this business and who is actually driving the leadership position here, it's actually NetApp. And flash is probably the classic example here. I'll just state it flat out. I would not trade the flash portfolio of NetApp with the flash portfolio of any other company we have to start it from scratch or otherwise. Kaushik Roy - Wunderlich: Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Srini Nandury from Summit Research. Srini Nandury - Summit Research : As you look at last quarter you gave us information about the number of customers you are adding, can you provide this statistic if you can this quarter? And as you look at average deal size over the years, how has that changed most recently? Tom Georgens : I don't remember a new customer component. We may have talked about in specifically in terms of maybe in EF or E-Series, but suffice to say those numbers were up huge, in fact the E-Series bookings roughly doubled in two quarters with the EF included. So that continues at a big number. So I don't remember that number off the top of my head, but its fine to say it's robust. In terms of aggregate deal size, in terms of overall transactions, if you look at our mix we are seeing 3000 and 6000 so I should say the mid range and high end platforms doing a bit better than the lower end platforms. So in the aggregate the ASP just on that basis will be going up, but that's individual box ASP. I think more broadly if there is probably one trend that we saw over the course of certainly of Q4 is we actually saw more bigger deals available to us. And if I said there was one thing that we saw in that quarter that was different than perhaps some other quarters is just very, very significant deals. And they come in various varieties. Some of them are Tech refresh and some of them in new projects. And the other thing is enterprise service and enterprise license agreements. Very, very large transactions are not to mention while I don't have this in a new term in terms of revenue realization you will see it on the differed balances up $100 million from last year. So if I just go to deals overall, I would say more bigger deals available to us, maybe that's a positive development, but too early to tell. But the other thing that we saw a lot of last quarter more so than any other quarters enterprise license agreements, enterprise service agreements. And the value to that of course is while it does have the near term revenue because of the ratability of it. It's a commitment to NetApp over the long term, obviously it's key and in some ways because the software is pretty sold. That's also a commitment to on-premises' computing. Srini Nandury - Summit Research : Thank you, Tom. Operator : The next question comes from Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal. Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal : Hi, Tom, I would like to ask on a strategy question as well, particularly related to the OEM business. The OEM business was down 34% this quarter. You are guiding it to decline by another 40%. The margins are lower than the branded business. Why be in the business? It sounds like you are letting customers continue to take their business back. Why not be more proactive in taking the business to its natural state rather than watching it decline? Tom Georgens : Well, I think that being in the business means a few things. I want to be clear on a couple of points. We could cease to serve products to our OEMs. I guess that's a way to exit the business. If the idea is why don't we just get rid of that business on the technology is that the technology underneath that business is the E-Series technology and the EF that goes with it, which is very strategic for us and there is a lot of momentum? And likewise the N-Series which is also on the same downward trajectory with IBM have ONTAP underneath it. So at the end of the day the technology investments behind these technologies that are driving our branded business are alive as well and we are excited about those as ever. However, they are taking through those through the OEM channels clearly is what we are talking about here. Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal : Yes. Tom Georgens : There are two things. One of which is the investment in terms of the restructuring that we just did. Clearly the OEM go to market activity around those vendors that are more committed to us long term that's clearly an area that we have taken down. And we get that next size in proportion to where we think this business needs to be. The other question of why we just stop selling to them, I think what that does is just takes the number down fast and that doesn't change the ultimate outcome. In the meantime there is no doubt that some of those products that are being sold to customers and we were going to get to on our own. Now the broader question for partners that have made choices other than NetApp we are not sitting idle by. We are competing to preserve that business and bring it into the NetApp domain. So the idea that this is a passive where you will sit and watch, I wouldn't say that. We've clearly scaled the business appropriately. We are clearly investing in the technology although targeted primarily for our branded customers. At the same time where the relationship is not good or where they are making choices about other products in that portfolio, we are aggressively pursuing that and competing with our branded product in our existing channels. Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal : So the inference time just that this business ends up being a 50 million to 60 million run rate business or does it ultimately go to a position where it's at zero. And I understand the technology is important, that not what I am suggesting, but just the OEM slice in particular. Tom Georgens : Yeah. I don't think it will ever go to zero, because their elements, their relationships in the OEM business that are actually quite positive that are entirely incremental to us and with the right investment very profitable for us as well. So we are not going to get rid of those. But it should be quirky, the reason why we broke this business out in the first place two years ago or three years ago from the very beginning was the understanding that was going to be on a trajectory different than the branded. The rationale of the transaction was not about the branded business. That was nice. That was really about the technology and the opportunity -- I'm sorry, it's not about the OEM business, it's not the technology and the opportunity we can connect on -- we could go after on the branded side. So if we thought that this business have the same economics and the same run rate we've never broken it out if they are two different categories. It was an understanding that we will be moving in this direction is why we want to be able to carve this off and just view whatever we get out of that as incremental and focus on the momentum on the branded side which on the E-Series has actually been quite strong. So at the end of the day, I think this latest step down was a surprise. We will upfront about that, that's not what we forecasted. On the other hand, the overall trajectory of down from the first day when we acquired it, that is not a surprise, and that's why we broke the businesses out and report the way we do. Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal : Okay. Thanks, guys. Operator : The next question comes from Lou Miscioscia from CLSA. Lou Miscioscia - CLSA: : And then secondarily, we've talked to a lot of service providers in hyperscale, web hosters and not all of them actually designed their own software, so making it difficult for you to sell any product to them. Where does that break exist? Could you shed some light on that? Is it just three or four that do it all themselves, five, 10, 15, where do you think it might exist? Thank you. Tom Georgens : Okay. So clearly a few questions in there; I think -- so let's actually start from the hyperscalers and work back. And so the likelihood of our selling or companies like us selling full systems to the hyperscalers to deploy in their environment is pretty low, because they've engineered their environment and written their own tools and in a lot of case they've written their own apps. So in that particular case, would we consider unbundling our software and selling elements of our intellectual property to them? Absolutely, we would, because the data management problems that they face don't go away. There are still challenging problems. I don't want to signal that that's what we're doing whether there is an incremental revenue stream associated with that, I'd just say that that's something that we will be opened to under the right circumstances. But the difference between the hyperscalers and some of the other service providers, even the large ones is in order to do these roll your own, develop your own solutions and infrastructure takes an enormous amount of R&D. i: However, they ultimately will need to compete with Amazon. And it isn't clear or certainly not clear that they've got the R&D to basically engineer all of these things themselves, which is driving a level of collaboration with them, and that drives the desire for such things. Its OpenStack technologies or open source technologies like OpenStack. So, from our point of view in helping our service providers create services that can compete with those guys we are also collaborating with a lot of the open source community to help them create solutions that they can customize for their environment that leverage the open source community. So it's a whole hierarchy of things. So I think if we are going to sell for the hyperscalers, primarily being intellectual property type of transaction and if we sell to service providers, in some cases depending on the scope and scale and complexity of the services they are offering by standard products, and in addition we will also try and do some element of customized do-it-yourself open source and that's what's really driving our investment in OpenStack. But the other thing about the hyperscalers is we are viewing this as the hyperscale only as the customer, and I think what you will hear more from us on Analyst Day, too much to go into here is the hyperscalers offer a set of capabilities that are very attractive to the customer and being able to operationilize that and deliver those values to the enterprise customer is still a very difficult problem. And the question is how do you create a seamless extension of on-premise computing into the cloud that can leverage the hyperscalers? And the key component of doing that is data management. And we will talk about our software-defined strategy and how ONTAP enables us to solve all of that. So the kind of longwinded answer here is that all of the service providers are both also partners. Sometimes we will sell them full systems, sometimes we will collaborate with them around their open source, sometimes we will sell intellectual property, but at the end of the day the end goal is how do we create a set of services that could be consumed by the enterprise and then afterward the seamless expansion of on-premise computing and the data management that goes with it is very, very, very important to realizing the hybrid cloud vision. Lou Miscioscia - CLSA: Thanks, Tom. Operator : Your next question comes from Rajesh Ghai from Macquarie. Rajesh Ghai - Macquarie: Yes, thanks. A lot of commentary on the goal regarding the momentum of the E-Series and EF-Series; I was hoping you could quantify the size of the branded E-Series business. And related to that, I wanted to understand the factors behind the decline of OEM business, how much of that has been caused by OEMs moving to other solutions or their own solutions and how much is related to the macro, secular challenges you are facing in the server businesses? Thank you. Tom Georgens : Well, I think the nature of the OEM business is first and foremost their ability to compete, and then the other factor is what is the product mix within that account? And I think that they all vary. IBM is probably the most visible and the most common one. They report the storage business separately down significantly in the last few quarters over 20%. Likewise, IBM also has a portfolio of products that they can sell that are alternatives to NetApp. So I think at IBM we have both of those dynamics in play, and that is their ability to sell-through has been challenged and likewise our positioning within their portfolio has been challenged. Now, the other OEMs vary OEM-by-OEM. And one of the things about the OEM business is you need to be careful about what we disclose about them. But I'd say that amongst our other OEMs I think we are firmly positioned in terms of the products that we offer, so the dynamic of mix shift within the OEM I don't think is in play. And I think most of the OEM dynamic is related to their own sell-through. Nick Noviello : So, maybe why don't I make a point there, Rajesh. We actually don't go into the specific details on the sizing of each piece of business. What I would say to you and Tom mentioned before around why we did this transaction three years ago and the value of the E-Series to that transaction. So when we go look at how are we doing on the transaction side of the fence and we look at the ramp up and the run rate we are now driving for on the E-Series branded side, we are actually well within, if not, trending above our original expectations of that business. So we are very satisfied with how the E-Series branded business is going and how that technology is working in this portfolio. Tom Georgens : Probably the other thing I would add on E-Series is that if you look at where EF is moving aggressively which is effectively SAN database acceleration. That's probably not a market that's been a dominant notion for us in the past. And it's probably safe to say that overwhelming majority of the opportunities we're pursuing there are opportunities that would not have been available to NetApp, had we not have that product in our portfolio. And I think likewise, if we look more broadly at the E-Series and where that's been deployed, the type of use cases around pricing performance and capacity optimization, those two are workloads that probably would not have been pursued by our sales force, but we not had those elements in the portfolio. So if I look at E-Series I think that there is no doubt that E-Series is not substantially overlapping what we currently have that E-Series is truly bringing incremental opportunities to NetApp both within our existing accounts and as a tool to open new accounts. Rajesh Ghai - Macquarie: Excellent, and thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank. Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank : Hi, thank you. I wanted to get your thoughts on overall enterprise spending as we move into the back half of the year, obviously enterprises have been confused about what they want to invest in terms of their infrastructure, and we are seeing a positive spending. Your guidance suggests there are some acceleration in growth in the back half of the year. I think IDC has updated their expectations expecting an acceleration on the back half, I just wanted to get your thoughts about linearity for the year. Thanks. Tom Georgens : Well, I think one of the things that's a factor that will be unique in NetApp is really federal. We saw a federal slowdown with the shutdown and the budget activities. And that hit us hard in Q3 and Q4. So we will have tougher compares on the federal side for sure in Q1 and Q2. So that's clearly a factor that's specific to us. I also think that we have got our own dynamics as our own product refresh, but the product's family of the hardware platforms are probably never been newer than they are today. So as we get the laps of those announcements into the market I think we could see some uptick there. I think a broader sense of overall IT spending, certainly we see equipment aging. We clearly see that. We see some bigger deals that I talked about earlier last quarter, but I think at this point it will be probably a little bit too early to both predict and return and also factor that into our guidance. Our guidance is pretty much based on the NetApp's specific factors and no fundamental material change in the market overall. If we get a tailwind we will take it, but right now we are assuming no change in the market as we think about our go-forward plans. Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank : Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Scott Craig from Bank of America. Scott Craig - Bank of America : Hi, thanks, good afternoon. And Nick, I was wondering if you could just discuss the gross margin outlook for fiscal 2015, there is obviously going to be a number of moving parts and that could be mix or whatever. So I was just wondering if you could give us your sort of assumptions as you look at the product and services and then some of the underlying assumptions even within those banks. Nick Noviello : Sure. I think when you look at the year and you look to the overall guidance of 63% to 64% there is always going to be puts and takes quarter-to-quarter. Over the past year on the product gross margin side we had a pretty substantial ramp up here over the course of the year. We've talked about the productivity we've driven in the system. Right? We have also talked about continued price competitiveness in spite of driving that additional productivity in the system. And in addition there is going to OEM mix. And that certainly was part of Q4. And I talked about warranty and those types of things as well. So those are all factors that we will work through in FY'15. So on the product side of the fence I'm not specifically pointing out your guidance range for product or service or SEM should be X. I'll potentially talk more about that at the end of June at our Analyst Day, but these types of rates certainly I would expect that product gross margin will be down a bit in Q1. So I wouldn't want anybody to take away that 58%, which is the exit from Q4 is the floor for next year and this will be what it is. It's going to be little bit more dynamic than that. But continuing to work the productivity side, looking at the mix, all of those pieces will play a part. On the services side of the fence we ended the year pretty substantially up. The services side is little fundamentally different from the product side. And why is that, because on the services side of the business we invest in front of the revenue that is to come, because in many respects big chunk of this business is us servicing contracts that we have entered into for periods of time. So we will from time-to-time make significant investments in that infrastructure and then take advantage of those investments as we go. So certainly when we look from a Q4 to a Q1, I'm expecting that services gross margin to come down. I expect the services gross margin to move around a bit over the course of the year, but again be within those types of guide posts of the overall margin guidance I gave at 63% to 64%. Last point on that service is 62.6%, which is a Q4 exit is a high watermark, and I'm looking at four years of history here. So I don't think you should take away -- that's the type of rate we would expect on services gross margin certainly in Q1 and likely for good part of the year and 2015. Tom Georgens : Yeah, I'd like to actually add a little bit different -- an additional commentary on the gross margin side. The gross margin side in terms of where we've been, it's actually up three points year-over-year in each of the last two quarters. And I think that's a function of several things. Nick went through a number of the elements, but on the product side, clearly we spend a lot of time this year working through the COGS side of the equation driving efficiencies in the business, and I'm really pleased with the work of the team on that front. But at the end of the day, the competitiveness in gross margin goes through the competitiveness of the product. And I think there is a lot to be said in that number in terms of the competitiveness of products than we were a year ago. So one of the questions that we get a lot in forums like this or in callbacks later is are you basically letting growth go in favor of gross margins? It's just simply not the case. I mean one of the things that I want to be really clear about is that in this environment there are not a lot of big deals running around and we have a lot of capacity chasing too few deals and nobody can afford to walk from deals. So we are competitive, we are aggressive, particularly in trying to break into new accounts. And NetApp is not walking away from business based on price. On the other hand, within a reasonable set of bounds at the other day price is not the primary driver, ultimately functionality, not with that limit, but within bounds functionality ultimately determines who wins and who loses here. I think what NetApp has proven over the course of this year is that with the training of our partners, the training of our people and the understanding of our customers of the value proposition that we can win on function that we don't have to the price leader to be successful here. I think that's what you are seeing, three points of gross margin increase for NetApp and you are also seeing declines in gross margin of our competitors. I don't think that's a coincidence that's directly tied to the competitiveness of products in the face of the customer. Scott Craig - Bank of America : Thank you. Operator : Our final question comes from Maynard Um from Wells Fargo. Maynard Um - Wells Fargo : Hi, thank you. Free cash flow as a percentage of net income over the past four years in the fourth quarter has been really in the mid-high 20% to 30%. In this quarter it's at 19%. I think some are obvious, but can you just talk about the puts and takes and then how we should think about free cash flow in Q1 and fiscal '15? Can this drive back up to sort of the 19% to 21% type levels? Thanks. Nick Noviello : Yeah. Maynard, I'll go into cash flow certainly at our Analyst Day. When we look at cash flow we certainly think about the high-teens types of numbers, and that's what we model out. And we are thinking through what we need in the business and what runs through on the net income side, but we are going to have to think about DSOs. Obviously we've talked about that earlier on this call; CapEx and a number of other factors. So when you think about free cash flow as a percentage of revenue, those types of high-teens is where we aim for that. Certainly it doesn't happen quarter-to-quarter. And Q1s are usually lower in terms of cash flow performance as a percentage of revenue. And then we look at capital allocation and I'll just reiterate we're going to expect again a year where we generate over a billion. We had very strong performance each year of the last several, and this is a cash flow generating company and at a high-teens as a percentage of revenue I think is very, very healthy. And then we go and talk about capital allocation. I think what we've done there over the past year and what we plan to do for this coming year is also very strong. Maynard Um - Wells Fargo : Great, thank you. Operator : I would now like to turn the call back over to Tom Georgens for final comments. Tom Georgens : Thank you, and thank you all of you for your interest in NetApp. I think as we finished Q4 and we finish the fiscal year, if I had a high level theme it's that NetApp was very, very strong on the execution front on the operational perspective driving very, very high gross margin, very, very high operating margins. So, on a tough environment I think the ability of the company to execute, drive value to our customers and ultimately deliver compelling returns to our shareholders with EPS up 22%, I think that came through. In calendar year 2013, where we had market share gains above the average of our last 10 years, and we continue to look forward to the upcoming year where we have things we did not have a year ago, we've got Clustered ONTAP, and that was true momentum. We've got the E-Series. We've got the momentum of our flash. We've got new platforms. We've got flash array on the way. And we also look forward at Analyst Day recognizing that this is also an industry in transition, but now we can compete for on-premise computing and the elements today. We are also talking about where we are going as a company, our vision for software defined, our vision for the cloud, and NetApp continues to be relevant and continues to be successful. So thanks all of you for your time today, and I look forward to seeing all of you at Analyst Day. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. I would like to turn the call over to your host, Kris Newton, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kris Newton : Hello and thank you for joining us on our Q1 fiscal year 2015 earnings call. With me today are CEO, Tom Georgens; and our CFO, Nick Noviello. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com along with the earnings release, our financial tables, a historical supplemental data table and the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation. As a reminder, during today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2015, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. Such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and are being made as of today. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons. We described some of these reasons in our accompanying press release, which we have furnished to the SEC on a Form 8-K. Please refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC, specifically our Form 10-K for fiscal year 2014, subsequent Form 10-Q quarterly reports and our current reports on Form 8-K also on file with the SEC and available on our website. During the call, we will also discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in today's press release and on our website. In a moment, Nick will walk you through some additional color on our financial results, and then Tom will give his perspective on the business this quarter. I'll now turn the call over to Nick. Nick Noviello : Thank you, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. NetApp executed well in Fiscal Q1. We achieved net revenues above the midpoint of our previous guidance range, evidenced that our strong portfolio solutions is well aligned with the evolving priorities of our customers and we delivered another quarter of strong operating results with non-GAAP gross margin, operating margin and EPS all above Q1 guidance ranges. Net revenues of $1.49 billion were down 10%, sequentially, reflective of typical Q4 to Q1 seasonality but less than the sequential declines we have experienced over each of the last two years. Branded revenue of $1.36 billion was 91% of net revenues and was up 1% from Q1 FY '14. OEM revenue continued to decline on a year-over-year basis consistent with our expectations. OEM revenue of $129 million was down 23% versus Q1 last year. Indirect revenue through the channels and OEMs accounted for 79% of Q1 net revenues due to typical seasonality and an increase in large transactions fulfilled directly in Q1. Consistent with historical trends, Arrow and Avnet contributed 22% and 16% of net revenues, respectively. Geographic performance came in as expected. Non-GAAP gross margin of 64.3% was just 10 basis points below Q4 and above our Q1 guidance range. Non-GAAP product gross margin of 57.1% was down almost a point sequentially on less favorable product mix but up almost four points year-over-year due to a combination of supply chain savings, favorable product mix and lower warranty costs. Service gross margin of 62.7% was consistent with Q4 and up more than three points year-over-year due to higher service revenues.  Non-GAAP operating margin was 15.9%, almost a point above our previous guidance. We continue to invest in the business to deliver innovative data management solutions for the hybrid cloud while at the same time maintaining prudence around overall spending. Consistent with my comments on the last two earnings calls, effective this quarter, we implemented a change in how we report our non-GAAP effective tax rate to be more reflective of our operational results and tax structure. As a result, we have excluded for Q1 and will exclude for future periods from our non-GAAP tax provision the impact of items such as income tax audit settlement and the temporary lapse of tax law, such as the federal R&D credit. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the first quarter was 16.5% in line with our expectation. Q1 weighted average diluted share count of 329 million shares was below our prior guidance and decreased by approximately 7 million shares sequentially due to share repurchase activity in the quarter and the benefit from Q4 repurchases. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.60 exceeded the high end of our prior guidance range by $0.02 reflecting an approximate $0.01 benefit from lower share count resulting from Q1 repurchases and the combination of higher than projected revenue and strong gross margins. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.6 billion in cash and investments, 19% of which is onshore. The sequential increase in onshore cash was due predominately to our $500 million seven-year senior notes issued in June. Inventory turns were at 20 and days sales outstanding decreased sequentially to 36 on normal seasonality. Deferred revenue of $3.1 billion was seasonally down versus Q4, though less so than in each of the last two years. That said, deferred revenue was up $135 million from Q1 last year. Q1 cash from operations was approximately $260 million versus $286 million in Q1 FY '14. Free cash flow was 11% of revenue in Q1 and was impacted by higher payment of annual incentive compensation and in audit settlements. The audit settlement had no impact to cash and cash equivalents as we utilized excess stock option benefits to offset taxes payable related to the audit. In Q1 we returned over $172 million to shareholders which included $119 million in share repurchases and $53 million in cash dividends. We remain on track to complete the last $1 billion of our share buyback program by the end of May 2015 consistent with the guidance we provided last quarter. Today, we also announced our next cash dividend of $0.165 per share of the company stock to be paid on October 22, 2014. Now turning to guidance. We are pleased with the momentum we see building in the business but remain conscious of market dynamic. Our target revenue range for fiscal Q2 is $1.49 billion to $1.59 billion which at the midpoint implies about 3% sequential growth and roughly flat revenue year-over-year. We expect continued branded revenue growth including a seasonal uptick related to the U.S. government\u2019s fiscal year ended September to be partially offset by continued declines in OEM revenue. We expect non-GAAP gross margins of approximately 64% to 64.5% and non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 17.5% to 18%. Based on our repurchases in Q1 and in the first 10 days of Q2, we expect our diluted share count for the quarter to be approximately 330 million shares. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share for Q2 to range from approximately $0.66 to $0.71 per share. Our expectations for fiscal 2015 remain unchanged at this time. We anticipate mid-single-digit branded revenue growth ramping over the course of the year and partially offset by declines in OEM revenue of up to 40% for the full year. So ultimately dependent on revenue mix and growth, we continue to expect non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 63% to 64% and non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 18% for fiscal 2015. We continue to expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the year to be about 16.5% and full year non-GAAP EPS growth of just under 10%. Finally, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flow and, as I indicated earlier, remain on track to complete our existing share repurchase plan by the end of May 2015. In closing, we are confident in our strategy of helping customers navigate the transformation of their IT deployment as they take advantage of new technologies like flash and new consumption models such as cloud. Our best-in-class portfolio is driving momentum in our branded business enabling us to invest in continued innovation while delivering shareholder value. Now I would like to turn the call over to Tom for some additional color on the quarter. Tom? Tom Georgens : Thank you, Nick, and good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased with the results the NetApp team delivered this quarter. The strength of our portfolio combined with a continued operational discipline enabled us to achieve revenue over the midpoint of our prior guidance with gross margin, operating margin and EPS above the top of our previous guidance ranges. IT is in the midst of a significant transition. Enterprises are facing the profound challenge of adopting new technologies and delivery options while managing the reality of their current infrastructure and meeting the increasing demands of the business. Customers see the business value of these new options but also recognize that they cannot abandon or even freeze in place the mature proven and compliance solutions that run the business today. CIOs need solutions that continue to enhance and optimize their current environment while simultaneously enabling the full potential of newer architectures and delivery models. NetApp\u2019s portfolio of data management solutions improves the economic flexibility and business impact of customers existing infrastructure while our cloud and technology vision gives them confidence in our ability to help them navigate the future. This message is resonating and more large enterprises are placing big bets on NetApp. Consistent with the increase in enterprise buying activity we saw in Q4 fiscal '14, we also saw a significant increase in deals over $1 million in Q1 from the same quarter last year. Cloud is the biggest disrupter to the industry. It can enable enterprises to optimize elements of their IT portfolio in ways that were never available before and provide flexibility and cost benefits for certain workloads. However, the economic benefits are not advantageous for all workloads. Likewise, there are noneconomic considerations like security, regulation and performance that also impact cloud decisions. Our customers are telling us that they want a hybrid cloud. The deployment of internal and external resources combines in a way that is optimized to meet today\u2019s needs with the ability to evolve over time. Seamless data management is integral to the realization of this vision. Once data is created, it needs to be managed forever and therefore accumulates which makes subsequent movement both time consuming and bandwidth intensive. This makes the requirements for storage different than that for servers and networking which are more fungible in nature. Only Data ONTAP, the industry\u2019s number one storage operating system, addresses these requirements through its rich software functionality that provides a seamless data management experience across internal and external cloud resources. Clustered ONTAP is unmatched in meeting the IT transformation requirements of both the enterprise and cloud service providers. The rapid adoption of Clustered ONTAP continued in Q1 with shipments of Clustered nodes growing 177% from last year. The attach rate of Clustered ONTAP increased across all product lines. Both midrange and high-end platforms are approaching a 50% attach rate and the recently introduced Cluster optimized FAS8000 family is above 60%. The success of Clustered ONTAP is due to its ability to provide support for a broad range of workloads and improve operational capabilities while reducing the overall complexity of the storage infrastructure. Clustered ONTAP enables customers to go incrementally and non-disruptively with the flexibility of a wide range of deployment options from conversion and integrated systems to third party arrays as well as software-only solutions. Customers also need a range of performance levels from this storage infrastructure. All data has a lifecycle over which its performance and economic value varies, which drives customer requirements for all flash, all disk and hybrid arrays. However, regardless of the attributes of a specific data at any point in time, almost all data is ultimately hybrid over its lifecycle necessitating automated data management as a critical component to realize the full potential of flash technology. In fact, the majority of our midrange and high-end system shift in a hybrid configuration with the mix of flash and hard drives. On our Q4 call, I talked about customer demand for all flash configurations of our FAS arrays. The ability to create all-flash nodes in a larger cluster with unified data management and transparent volume migration is a compelling capability not offered by alternative architectures. In Q1 we built on this momentum and expanded on our flash portfolio by introducing all-flash FAS products to further address the need for ultimate performance while leveraging existing tools and processes. Shipments of all-flash arrays, our EF family and all-flash FAS products grew 48% and flash capacity shipped more than double from Q1 a year ago. With the broadest portfolio of array-based flash solutions, NetApp is well positioned to help IT organizations optimize for a wide variety of performance, efficiency and scalability requirements. I am proud to say that just last week, our flash solutions were honored with two awards at the Flash Memory Summit for most innovative customer implementation and for the best all-flash NAS array. In Q1, we refresh our entry in high-end FAS product lines with the introduction of the FAS2500 family and the FAS8080 EX. Year-on-year, our high-end and midrange FAS shipments grew 14% and 10%, respectively. Entry FAS systems were down 19% consistent with our expectations of the transition to the new FAS2500. Branded E-Series systems, inclusive of the EF products, more than doubled from Q1 a year ago. FlexPod, our converged architecture solution, continues to perform well with shipments up 25% from last year. Now let\u2019s come back to the big industry disruptor, the cloud. It is generally viewed as a threat to enterprise IT players but with our differentiated approach, we see it as an opportunity. Enterprises value our seamless data management as new cloud service providers who rely on our proven efficiency, seamless scalability and non-disruptive operations to support a responsive and profitable public cloud operation. Of our top customers in Q1, roughly half are companies that offer cloud-based services and purchase NetApp for use in both their internal enterprise IT and external cloud offering. Where the customers are providers or consumers of cloud solutions, NetApp is uniquely positioned to add value. In Q1 we announced the extension of NetApp private storage solutions to include Microsoft Azure and demonstrate our ability to interoperate between Azure and Amazon web services. Additionally, we deepened a hybrid cloud partnership with Equinix. The Equinix cloud exchange and dynamically connect NetApp private storage customers to multiple public clouds by maintaining full ownership and control of their data with NetApp private storage, yet being able to access multiple cloud compute resources through high bandwidth links, customers can realize a full flexibility of economic benefits of multi-cloud solutions without the risk and regulatory concerns associated with relinquishing data stewardship. We serve a broad range of workloads with the ability to bridge the enterprise on premises architectures of today with the cloud architectures of the future. Clustered Data ONTAP is a data management framework to seamlessly enable enterprise hybrid cloud. E-Series provides us access to new workloads and customers and complements ONTAP as a dedicated, high performance SAN solution. Spanning both ONTAP and E-Series environments are out FlexPod converged architecture and hybrid all-flash solutions. FlexPod helps customers by removing the risk and burden of integration, the speed of deployment of new technology. Our flash solutions fill our customer requirements for high performance storage including the displacement of legacy frame arrays. The set of workloads and architectures that we address today is unparallel in the company\u2019s 20-year history. With our portfolio of solutions, we are helping the world\u2019s largest enterprises transform their IT departments with a better way to manage their environments, deliver new capabilities to the business and achieve their vision for the hybrid cloud. We are seeing momentum in our key investments areas; Clustered ONTAP, flash, cloud, branded E-Series and expect that momentum to accelerate over the course of fiscal year '15. We are confident in our continued ability to win with our best-in-class portfolio that addresses the most predominant customer needs, our track record of innovation and our enterprise relationships. We are also confident that our strategy and financial performance will translate into shareholder returns. We will continue to drive operating leverage in our business model to support continued investment in innovation and future growth. I\u2019d like to thank the entire NetApp team for their continued dedication in helping our customers realize their goals while maintaining a high level of operational discipline. At this point, we will open up the call for Q&A. As always, I ask you to be respectful of your peers on the call and limit yourself to one question, so we can address as many people as possible. Thank you. Operator? Operator : (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Brian Marshall with ISI. Your line is open. Brian Marshall - ISI: Great. Thanks, guys. Nice quarter. A question with respect to flash array. Could we get a quick update there on what we\u2019re expecting for back half of the year launch? It\u2019s been over a year since you\u2019ve made any material acquisitions. Was wondering is that reflective of your thought about just being sort of avoid of any innovation on the private company landscape within storage and you want to tackle more like flash array and build from the ground up going forward? Thanks. Tom Georgens : Okay. Well, first two questions and as far as flash array is concerned, we\u2019ve been saying for quite some time that that\u2019s a this year product and we\u2019ll actually see customer shipments of that product in fact next month. So really no change from what we\u2019ve been saying all along and continued progress there. And in addition to flash array, obviously the EF momentum continues to be strong and we also did our all-flash FAS announcement last quarter. So in terms of flushing out of the total portfolio for the different used cases we see, I think we feel really good about the flash portfolio. And we think flash, as we said along, will live in many incarnations; in hybrid storage, as standalone devices and the compelling component of all-flash FAS. It\u2019s not even an all-flash FAS, it\u2019s an all-flash node in a broader cluster leveraging all the data management and the transparent volume migration that comes with it. Overall, to answer your flash question, flash array is on the way, as I said in used cases that is targeted at. I think we\u2019re still very, very excited about that. We\u2019re excited to get that in the market. Certainly, we\u2019ve had a lot of dialogue with customers. We\u2019ve had (indiscernible) customers\u2019 hands, but the total flash portfolio I think certainly has been a key component of our momentum. As far as the acquisition side, I wouldn\u2019t read anything into the situation. I think we\u2019re always looking for tuck-in acquisitions that are going to be meaningful to fill either gaps or opportunities in our product line and you should expect to see us continue to do that. As far as larger transactions are concerned, those are going to be entirely asynchronous, they\u2019re going to be functions of timing, availability, costs, execute ability. So I wouldn\u2019t basically single any fundamental transition or thought or planning around large transactions, but smaller transactions should be somewhat on a regular cadence. So you should expect to see us do that, so certainly no change in our posture on either of those fronts. Brian Marshall - ISI: Thanks, Tom. Operator : Our next question comes from Lou Miscioscia with CLSA. Your line is open. Lou Miscioscia - CLSA: Okay, great. Maybe if I could tie two questions together\u2026 Tom Georgens : I\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t. Lou Miscioscia - CLSA: Okay. So when I look at the OEM revenue, I thought that that came in a little bit higher than expected and the branded, it came in a little bit lower. And I realized you reiterated your guidance for the full year for the branded hitting midpoint, let\u2019s say, 5% type of growth. If it doesn\u2019t hit that, would you consider trying to reduce some of your OpEx which is a bit higher than some of your competitors? Nick Noviello : So, Lou, it\u2019s Nick. Let me start on that one, Tom may have some comments as well. So, the indication on OEM was it was going to be up to 40 \u2013 and the discussion on OEM was for the year. And as a business declines, it\u2019s going to be dynamic. We\u2019ve seen some and you all have seen some announcements with respect to N-Series that\u2019s going to be effective this quarter. So, as we decline through pieces calling a specific by quarter is going to be complicated and we\u2019re not going to do it. And we\u2019ve talked about an up to 40 for the year decline, I think we\u2019re still consistent with that and that\u2019s reflective in my comments. And the branded revenue growth, the discussion was mid-single-digit. You saw branded revenue growth and I think that accelerates over the course of the year, really consistent with our view at Financial Analyst Day consistent with what we said in the fourth quarter. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any net change here. Tom Georgens : Yes, and we moved from a negative position last quarter into a growth position this quarter. So I think that that\u2019s the start. The margin, we expect to build over the \u2013 as the year progresses. As I think about the year and as it plays out in terms of where we\u2019re going to get continued growth, certainly it compares on the federal side of the house get a little bit easier in the second half of the year. And if I think about where we are today and things that are coming to market from where we are a year ago, whether it be clustered ONTAP in production, we had a very strong E-Series quarter, OnCommand Insight, our support portfolio, flash, we just refreshed all the platforms. We laid out our cloud strategy. So I see a number of stimulants to our business that were not available to us a year ago, even six months ago. As far as the broader question about operating expense, we\u2019re sized to our plan for this year. We\u2019re off to a good start. So certainly if there\u2019s a major reversal to that, we\u2019ll have to change our plans just like always. But I think we\u2019re on track and that\u2019s not top of mind right now. Right now it\u2019s making the investments necessary to continue to feel the growth and so in no way defensive about our OpEx spending at this point in time. We have a plan and we\u2019re executing to it. We haven\u2019t made any changes to it. Lou Miscioscia - CLSA: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian White with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. Brian White, please check your mute button. Your line is open. Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald : Tom, I\u2019m wondering if you could just walk us around the world in terms of the trend you\u2019re seeing by geography? It looks like EMEA outperformed APAC and Americas, so maybe some color there. I guess, what are you seeing on emerging markets? Some companies are seeing weakening again, some are \u2013 just curious? Thanks. Tom Georgens : Yes, I think in the geo breakdown there\u2019s a couple of elements, obviously includes some of our OEM business which distorts the number to some degree. And then also timing of revenue relative to bookings. I\u2019d say if you think about from a bookings perspective, which is a little bit more current, EMEA kind of carried us and actually did a really good job last year but I\u2019d say that the biggest thing that we saw last quarter that was different is we saw strength back in the enterprise. We saw larger big deals, particularly U.S. enterprise for a variety of factors but it\u2019s kind of felt like it\u2019s been improving for the last six months whether it\u2019s maturity of Clustered ONTAP and adoptions of technology or macro in nature, but I\u2019d say from where we stand today from six months ago, clearly the return on enterprise spending is probably the biggest notable change and we see that across the board. So in terms of activity levels, the U.S. both commercial and public sector were probably the stronger areas this quarter which is probably like last year. But around the world, EMEA is still \u2013 after a pretty good year I think they continued along at that pace but not quite as good as the U.S. in the public sector. Your question on emerging markets for one thing is we\u2019re not as penetrated equally invested in all of the emerging markets but the two where we made significant investments are clearly India, we have a big infrastructure. That has actually saw some momentum in the last six months, so we\u2019re actually pleased about the progress there. And China was also in the plus category for us. The other segments, Brazil and Russia, have other complexity to them, but those are not major contributors to NetApp at this point in time, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve got any real relevant macro commentary there given our market share but China and India still are contributors to us. We\u2019re positive about that and probably the biggest difference we saw last quarter and the end of the prior quarter was probably a rebound in enterprise spending in the U.S. Brian White - Cantor Fitzgerald : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Andrew Nowinski - Piper Jaffray : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. So just wanted to ask you a question on Clustered ONTAP. It\u2019s ramping nicely and you\u2019re seeing a bigger attach rate across all of your platforms. I guess can you give us any insight on what improvements are coming with 8.3? And then based on the new features that customers are asking for, how much of an impact do you think it will have on your win rate against the competition? Tom Georgens : Well, I think \u2013 I\u2019ll talk about 8.3 in a second, but I think overall the ramp of Clustered ONTAP has been pretty gratifying. I think in the early days of the ramp, it was primarily brand new to NetApp accounts moving into new workloads in existing accounts and now it\u2019s becoming clearly a lot more mainstream in our larger accounts and a predominant selling motion by our sales force. So I think the ramp has been quite good. A year ago we were talking about feature parity and why you getting 7-Mode and Clustered ONTAP and not having nearly that much of a conversation at this point in time. And on top of that, the transition tools that we\u2019re in the APAC to release are being widely deployed and helping customers make the transition from 7-Mode to Clustered ONTAP as well. So 8.3 has got things like Metrocluster. It\u2019s got a whole bunch of other performance enhancements. Metrocluster is a product that we use for higher availability and disaster recovery. It allows us to compete with recovery times that are basically superior to all of our competitors including the frame arrays that are something that we use to basically sell to enterprise accounts. So it\u2019s a clear differentiator for us and this will not necessarily be the Metrocluster of Clustered ONTAP. It will actually be a brand new set of functionality that will deliver that capability and a lot more. So that\u2019s probably the big payload component of 8.3. We probably do have some customers waiting for it, but we\u2019re certainly not in the category we were a year ago where we had a substantial amount of our customer base waiting for feature parity before they move forward I think for the vast majority of our customer base certainly on a unit basis, those days are passed and the migration has begun. Andrew Nowinski - Piper Jaffray : All right, great. Thanks a lot, guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays. Your line is open. Ben Reitzes - Barclays Capital : Can you just talk a little bit more about your comment about the pickup in enterprise spending, what in particular did you see? Did you see some more excitement with regard to your new products or what were you really getting at there and the sustainability of what you\u2019re seeing in the U.S.? Tom Georgens : Yes, I think first and foremost I think the message is size of deals and we still have tick-up in $1 million plus deals in Q1 which is generally not the quarter we do that. And we saw it in our enterprise accounts, we saw it in a fair number of service providers, big investments in the service providers. As we indicated in the earnings calls, we have a lot of customers that are both enterprise consumers of technology and also service providers themselves, so we\u2019ve seen it really in those two categories. I wouldn\u2019t align it to any individual industry. I\u2019d say most industries are \u2013 there are some clear aggressive buyers, some even financial services have had some good aggressive buyers and a lot of people that are pulling back at the same time. I won\u2019t say it\u2019s universal but I think probably the biggest indicator of confidence in the future is large transactions and also enterprise license agreements which is once again a long-term commitment to NetApp they\u2019re willing to make upfront. So I think that that momentum is heartening. Obviously, it\u2019s early to tell, it\u2019s not ready to call a trend, but we\u2019ve certainly seen more of that in the last four months than we\u2019ve seen in quite a while. And enterprise and the cloud service providers; enterprise is where the money is, cloud service providers is where the growth is and it\u2019s good to see momentum in both of those and certainly interest in the technology. Now that said, independent of just deal size and what appears to be more availability of budget, we are certainly seeing a broader range of our products being sold into these accounts. E-Series brand had another very, very strong quarter. In fact it almost overpowered Q4 to Q1 seasonality. So that\u2019s up substantially year-over-year. OnCommand Insight, which is the portfolio products that we acquired and integrated over the years, had some very, very large transactions, a $9 million transaction at a major energy company. So we\u2019re seeing momentum with that too. A big portion that we\u2019ve been telling our team is that in these enterprise accounts, we need to be selling the entire portfolio because we have compelling solutions there. So that\u2019s been a big push over the last six months. So we\u2019re certainly seeing that. So to your second point, I certainly think that the strength of the portfolio and the breadth of the portfolio is giving us more selling opportunities into those accounts. But that said, the broader trend of larger transactions of longer term commitments is also gratifying as well and I think that\u2019s independent of the portfolio. Ben Reitzes - Barclays Capital : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets : Good afternoon, guys. I was just hoping if you\u2019ll talk a little bit when it comes to your October quarter guide, specifically how you\u2019re thinking about the public sector tracking in the October quarter? I think historically that segment has been up 40%, 45% for you guys on a sequential basis. Do you expect to compare the level of growth going forward in this October quarter or do you have a different set of expectations there? Nick Noviello : Sure. This is Nick. We are going to expect a sequential increase in the business for sure. But as you know, over the last couple of years here we have moved through sequestration, we\u2019ve moved through shutdown, we\u2019ve moved through a variety of things that have obviously impacted the end result of the U.S. public sector. So we have just like every quarter really started with a bottom up forecast of the business including in the U.S. public sector. We expect a sequential increase. We\u2019re not calling a specific percentage for that. I wouldn\u2019t want to do that on this call. It\u2019s built into the guidance we\u2019ve given you. And we look at that just like we look at the Americas commercial, just like we look at the things Tom talked about in terms of enterprise, buyers and large transactions. So, all of that is built in. Again, we expect a sequential increase for sure. We\u2019ve got a little bit more budget clarity here for sure. We at least hope we don\u2019t see shutdown. There\u2019s nothing like that on the horizon right now, but that\u2019s all built in. Tom Georgens : Yes, I\u2019d just echo Nick\u2019s comments about more budget clarity. Last year we were finishing a fiscal year which the sequester was in effect and then transitioning into a period where the government could conceivably get and ultimately did get shut down, both of which happened within our quarter. And I\u2019d say that where we are now it isn\u2019t that we\u2019ve seen a massive reflex of bounce back in spending but there\u2019s a lot more budget certainty. So I think we have a little bit better understanding that the end of the fiscal year dynamics for the government will be more reminiscent of prior years than last year, and that\u2019s baked into the guidance that we gave going forward. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks a lot and congrats on the quarter guys. Tom Georgens : Thank you. Nick Noviello : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Kelleher with D. A. Davidson. Your line is open. Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Thanks for taking the question. Most of mine have been answered. I was just wondering if you might give us an update on the Amazon partnership. I know you talked a little bit about cloud, but I don\u2019t know if you could talk a little bit more about that one specifically? Tom Georgens : Well, I think we\u2019re looking to do a number of things both in terms of partnering and as a leverager of their infrastructure. But one of the things that we\u2019re clearly doing with NetApp private storage and the concept of NetApp private storage is that the data will reside on the customers\u2019 network likely at a colo facility but connected to the customers\u2019 network and have access through a set of technologies that gave them high bandwidth access to the compute forms and the long and the short of it is for an Amazon web services type of analogy. What the customer can do is maintain control and data stewardship of their data yet have access to the elastic compute and the ability to have instant access to a very, very large server form and likewise downsize at the same time and basically have all the benefits and the flexibility of the elastic computer of Amazon without having to have any of the concerns about security and data ownership. So they maintain control of their data and have access to the flexible compute and get a substantial value of the flexibility that [ViPR] (ph) scales can provide at a fraction of the risk. What we\u2019ve done this past quarter is that we\u2019ve actually added Azure to that mix and as a result they can do the same thing with Azure. In our Analyst Day that we did this year with our industry analysts, we demonstrated the ability to interoperate between the two and basically run an application in one, send it over and operate in the other. And the value of that and the extension of the NPS vision which initially was really about data stewardship and access to flexible compute is now really about multi cloud. And that is I can effectively have a legitimate multi-cloud strategy that I can have resources available to me from Amazon, I can have resources available to be from Microsoft. And if I hold the data then I can truly broker the multi-cloud environment for our customers. That\u2019s really where we\u2019re heading with the NetApp private storage is the idea of multi-cloud. Our customers are not giving control of the data and therefore being locked into a specific cloud provider. They can have access to the flexible computing networking on multiple players yet they still own their data and they still have all of the data stewardship, all the data responsibility and all the security protection that they would have as if it was on their own infrastructure. So that\u2019s really the vision of NetApp private storage; access to the flexible computing, the flexibility and economics of the server networking that that provides yet maintain control of their storage without subjecting themselves to any of the intellectual property and security risk. So that\u2019s really where we\u2019re going with that. I think it has really significant value to enterprises. There are a lot of customers who hone the appeal of maintaining control of their data, whether it be for flexibility or cloud mobility, has tremendous value to them but they also want the elasticity of the compute models that Microsoft and Amazon and an ever increasing set of other providers can ultimately provision for them. That\u2019s really the play there is how do we bring the cloud as a resource to bear with its economics and its flexibility and how do we make that consumable by the enterprise in a seamless and secure fashion so they can make it an integral part of their overall operating environment. Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Katy Huberty, please check your mute button. Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley : Tom, can you help us reconcile the commentary on more large deals and just an overall better enterprise and service provider spending environment with still low-single-digit growth in the branded business? And does enterprise and service provider strength come at the expense of deals through the channel given that indirect mix decrease for the first time since '08 this quarter? Tom Georgens : Yes, I think there\u2019s a couple of points there. I think one of the other outlets for the renewed activity that we see and I like I said the bookings and the revenue have a certain timeline to them is that we \u2013 and one of the areas where a lot of that will go is into deferred balance. And we actually saw deferred revenue increase $135 million year-over-year. So it\u2019s some of the things that we do. I talked about the launch transaction we did in OnCommand. That\u2019s entirely a ratable deal for us, that\u2019s entirely in the deferred balance and not recognized in this particular quarter. And a lot of longer term transactions we\u2019re doing with our partners whether it be enterprise license agreements or enterprise service agreements, those are also ratable over time. So some of the manifestation of the increased momentum would be in revenue growth and the branded improved from last quarter but it basically store only 1%. On the other hand, we\u2019re also seeing a big increase in the deferred balance which is another place where some of that business activity will ultimately lie and that will come back through the revenue line over time of course. And the other question was\u2026? Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley : Should we expect that indirect declines (indiscernible) through service providers? Tom Georgens : Yes, I think two things on the indirect, one of which is in the indirect numbers the OEM business. And if you back the OEM business out, the percentage of our business through the channel in Q1 this quarter was actually higher than it was each of the last three years. But that said, with the enterprise business, some of that enterprise business does flow through our more sophisticated and larger channel partners and some of it does not. So I think that as we do more enterprise business, the likelihood that some of that will flow through some of our purely direct channels is higher and as a result that will also take the number down. So it\u2019s not a consequence of any strategy that we\u2019ve made or any change of investment, at least not in the near term. It\u2019s more of just that we see more of the enterprises, the enterprises are more likely to be direct than the midsized business. As a result, we see some variability, but overall no change to strategy. And even on a Q1 to Q1 compared over the last three years, we still saw channels, a greater percentage of the mix than any of those prior years. Operator : Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is open. Aaron Rakers - Stifel Nicolaus : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I\u2019d like to go back to the opportunity with Data ONTAP and cluster mode capabilities. With now having a full refresh product family in your portfolio, is there any kind of quantitative context you can provide with regard to how much of your installed base is running cluster mode today? What the age of that installed base looks like? And what I\u2019m really trying to get at is what\u2019s the upgrade cycle, how are you thinking about that opportunity over the next several quarters? Tom Georgens : Yes. I think it\u2019s safe to assume that the installed base which has been assembled over a very long period of time is still primarily 7-Mode, and some of that will stay. Some of our customers will stay in 7-Mode and just put new applications. In Clustered ONTAP I think it varies across the board. I think what we see in general is that most of the upgrade activity to Clustered ONTAP also comes in conjunction with a hardware upgrade, so they don\u2019t do the transition twice. And when there\u2019s a significant gap in time between when they believe they\u2019ll be able to go live with Clustered ONTAP they\u2019re more likely to basically do a hardware upgrade now and then basically wait in time. But the closer they get together, they would love to do the hardware upgrade and the software upgrade at the same time. So I think that some of what we\u2019ve been seeing over the last six months is that customers have evaluated the product, they\u2019ve tested it. It has the feature sets that they need, they\u2019ve proven it in their lab and now particularly with the hardware refresh, they can go ahead and do a hardware refresh in their environment and do the upgrade at the same time. If they were not confident on Clustered ONTAP then I suspect they would be deferring hardware purchases. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re completely through that cycle and that\u2019s not a concern anymore but I certainly believe that waiting for the release of Clustered ONTAP that they could actually run in production, delaying hardware purchases, but I still think there\u2019s some of that \u2013 I think that that\u2019s been diminished over the last six months. Operator : Our next question comes from Jayson Noland with Robert Baird. Your line is open. Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Associates: Great. Thank you. Tom, I wanted to ask about FlexPod, strong again and we hear good things in the channel. We\u2019re seeing more converged solutions and hearing more about hyper converged. FlexPod\u2019s likely a material percentage of revenue now. Is there still innovation that can be done there and is the growth rate sustainable? Tom Georgens : The answer to both those questions is yes. And we\u2019ve got a low line of things around innovation, particularly around some of the value proposition of Clustered ONTAP and translating that to the entire FlexPod whether it be non-disruptive operations or scalability, all of those types of things I think are all really, really big and important plays for us. Take FlexPod, actually even further up market and some more mission critical applications. So I think we clearly see a lot of strength there. We\u2019ve also seen integration of FlexPod with E-Series now, eventually target a different set of workloads. And obviously some joint development activity around newer technologies like OpenStack that are strategic to both of us particularly in the service provider space. So I think there\u2019s no end of \u2013 certainly no near-term end of innovation that we can be doing together to basically drive this business forward. And that is only on the product side. There\u2019s also a bit of market side in terms of positioning the products, better alignment of our partners, more global deployment of this technology. In my interaction with Cisco, in my interaction with John Chambers, there is no congratulation here. The question is how do we take the business to the next level and continue to generate growth for both of us. This is a meaningful business for us even at their scale. It\u2019s a meaningful business for them. They\u2019ve made that abundantly clear to us and as a result, doubling the business from here over some timeframe is meaningful for both of us and those are the types of things that we\u2019re trying to talk about and those are the type of things we\u2019re trying to get into the budgets planned and moving forward. So, yes, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any let up on FlexPod. Certainly, I don\u2019t think that we\u2019ve reached terminal velocity of that product by any means. Jayson Noland - Robert W. Baird & Associates: I appreciate the color, Tom. Operator : Our next question comes from Maynard Um with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Maynard Um - Wells Fargo : Hi. Thank you. Looking at your free cash flow as a percentage of sales is about 10.5%. Q1 is usually seasonally low so presumably you\u2019re on track to that 17% to 19% target. But when you look at what\u2019s happening now in the ELA cycle helping the deferred revenues, are you just being conservative on that ratio for the year or do you think you can get to the low 20s like you have in the past? Can you just walk us through some of the dynamics to those numbers? Thanks. Nick Noviello : Hi, Maynard. It\u2019s Nick. First of all, I\u2019d say the guidance for the year and the discussion in that high-teens type of level stands to first quarter. We have a lot of pieces of the business. We talk about the dynamics of the business for the rest of the year, how we\u2019ve maintained guidance at this point in time. Sure there\u2019s a difference in terms of Q1 versus Q1 last year in terms of free cash flow as a percentage of revenue. There\u2019s a couple of points and I made those points in the script on those. But this is a strong cash generating company and we continue to do quite well there. That is built into the guidance and I think our expectations remain consistent at this point in time, no net change. Obviously, as things or if things do change, we\u2019ll give you that point of view when it\u2019s necessary. Maynard Um - Wells Fargo : I guess the real question was if the deferred revenues are increasing because of the ELAs, I guess what are the offsetting items that are not allowing that deferred revenue to drive that cash flow to a greater level this year? Nick Noviello : So just Q1, as an example, so on a year-over-year basis, the cash \u2013 deferred revenue is up $135 million. That is better than what we\u2019ve done in the past. The sequential decline is less. We\u2019ll have to look at all those pieces. ELAs are not an occurrence that is happening every day, right, in any form. There are elements of this business model as it grows and as we look at different business models and sell those, all of those will be built into our guide over time, but they are emerging. So these are pieces of business, the deferred revenues for the company over $3 billion, so in terms of moving the needle on free cash flow as a percentage of revenue and that type of number, that\u2019s going to be \u2013 it\u2019s not an immediate light switch; one way of 20% or another way of 20% is the way I\u2019d look at it. And as things change over time, we\u2019ll certainly give you that guidance over time. The net is a strong cash flow generating company. It\u2019s going to continue that way and the ELAs, how we sell business, we\u2019re going to be thinking about the cash generating side as well along the way. Tom Georgens : And specifically for Q1 I think \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t put Q1 as a trend. We had bonuses paid in Q1 and I think thanks to our employees the numbers were higher than last year (indiscernible) tax settlement. We had a few other things that are out there. So I think the long-term cash generation of the business particularly when you add in the higher gross margin and the higher operating margin I think still remains very, very robust. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citi. Your line is open. Jim Suva - Citi Research : Thank you. Congratulations to you and your team there. My question is concerning gross margins. It looks like you had much better than expected gross margins, so congratulations on that. And if I recall right back at your Investor Day in June, you were kind of implying or stated that gross margins for the year should be like 63% to 64%. So can you help me understand the cost behind the beat in the solid guide and how I bridge that with your full year guidance of 63% to 64%, because it looks like we\u2019re actually tracking quite a bit above that gross margin goal for this year? Thank you. Nick Noviello : Sure, Jim, it\u2019s Nick. So, certainly, we gave that 63% to 64% guide for the year. The two pieces here and I talked about it a little bit in the scripted comments are on the product gross margin and the services gross margin. So each of them has a couple of different pieces to it and let me walk you through it. So on the product gross margin, I talked about product mix, I talked about supply chain savings and I talked about warranty. Now those things can move around and in fact in past quarters, what I\u2019ve indicated on the supply chain savings is we generally realize it or recognize it and then we pass some of it through or a lot of it through depending upon what it is. If it\u2019s on commodities, we pass it straight through to customers. And there will be a timing difference between the time we update the price list versus sometimes when we recognize the save. So that\u2019s something that will move. So if you were to say, hey, Nick, at this point in time product gross margin should just continue to go up, that\u2019s not necessarily \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t necessarily agree with that because we have to look at the timing of the pass through of items, the type of business we\u2019re doing and blend that altogether on product gross margin. On service gross margins, a little bit of a different set of statistics going on. Number one is we have to look at service revenues and what types of service revenues those are. And if those are hardware maintenance contract revenues or if those are professional services revenues, those have different margin profiles associated with them and the other thing on services that we have to look at and we talked about from time to time is investments in the services infrastructure, because in Q1 versus Q4 I would look at the performance here as a bit of leveraging the expense base of the structure that\u2019s there. But as we look at installed base and installed base growth, remember we invest ahead of it to make sure that we are fully capable of servicing that installed base as it comes to fruition. So, yes, benefits on gross margin here in the first quarter of the year, we feel very good about that. We\u2019re going to continue pushing on all of those levers. But we\u2019re not changing that full year view because on the product side of the fence, the pass-throughs, sometimes the competitiveness we want to put into transactions or the services side on the investments and the infrastructure, those things can change and we will run those levers over the course of the year. Jim Suva - Citi Research : Congratulations, again. Got it. Thanks. Tom Georgens : Thank you. The one thing I want to add on the gross margin side is Nick talked about the savings. I think the team \u2013 we\u2019ve talked a lot about products that go to market, but I think the team has done a remarkable job operationally to really drive efficiencies into our supply chain and we\u2019ve realized that benefit last year. We\u2019re looking to drive it this year. The other thing I wouldn\u2019t underestimate is I don\u2019t think it\u2019s any coincidence that the gross margins have improved as the value proposition of Clustered ONTAP became better understood by our sales force and our customers. The industry is littered with companies that are talking about declining gross margins. At NetApp it\u2019s at the highest gross margins in our history and up three points year-over-year. So I think we feel really, really good about that. Now on the other hand, we also reserved the right to use that gross margin advantage to create opportunities for ourselves where we see them, whether it be new markets or new accounts or new opportunities. So that\u2019s also factored into this is that if we believe there\u2019s an opportunity, not to broadly lose discipline on discounting because we certainly don\u2019t want to do that, but for strategic markets or strategic accounts we\u2019re certainly willing to be very, very aggressive with the product line. So I\u2019m really pleased operationally. I think we\u2019ve done really, really smart things there but I think it\u2019s a validation of a value proposition in particular that our margins are increasing while others are decreasing, but we also reserve the right to use that for competitive advantage in the right circumstances. Jim Suva - Citi Research : Great. Congratulations, again. Tom Georgens : Thanks. Operator : Our last question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS. Your line is open. Steve Milunovich - UBS: Thanks. I wonder if you know what percentage of your capital shift today is flash and what impact that has on margin as it increases? Tom Georgens : See I don\u2019t have that off the top of my head. I do know that our capacity increased 23% year-over-year in the aggregate and flash is a greater percentage that it\u2019s been in the past not surprisingly, although we see flash in my incarnations; that\u2019s disk capacity. We also shift flash as plug-in cards as a cashing product. In terms of overall gross margin, I can\u2019t imagine it has a material impact at this point in time and we ship it in various points. So I would not make the claim that flash overall is either driving the gross margins up or taking it down. But at the end of the day, flash as a capacity driver is not the biggest one. Clearly, if customers are looking for capacity they\u2019re going to go to a hard drive. So flash is primarily a performance driver. So the likelihood that\u2019s going to be a very large percentage of our revenue at any point in time I think is pretty low. I just don\u2019t think that\u2019s what the data center looks like. Flash is going to accelerate low latency, high performance workload and as a result, it will be optimized for that. But the economics of it are such that it will always be cheaper to store less critical, less active data on solid-state drives. And I think the challenge and the ultimate value add to be provided to the enterprise is the company that can actually manage that migration over the data lifecycle to put the most important data on flash and everything else on hard drives recognizing that over time the active data becomes idle and has new active data that needs to be stored, and that\u2019s a key part of our value add. So kind of a long answer to your question is I don\u2019t expect to flash to be a meaningful or a very large percent of our overall capacity even through it\u2019s growing very, very quickly and not all of our flash is going to be in the form of hard drives. Some of it will also be in the form of plug-in boards because I think that flash and all of its substantiations are going to matter to the enterprise and we intend to do all of them. Steve Milunovich - UBS: Thanks. Operator : This ends our Q&A session today. I\u2019ll turn it back to management for closing remarks. Tom Georgens : Well, first of all, thank you for your interest in NetApp. I think we\u2019re pleased with the outcome of the quarter coming in above what we thought we would on the guidance and obviously very, very strong on the EPS and the profitability side. Gross margins had an all-time high and very, very strong operating margin in roughly flat environments still generating a point of operating margin leverage. So I think we see clearly momentum around Clustered ONTAP, around branded E-Series, around OnCommand. This past quarter we spent a fair amount of time with industry analysts and financial analysts and customers, in fact I saw particularly talking about our cloud strategy or where we go from here. I think our ability to win and gain share in the market as it exists today, I think is very, very strong. I think we\u2019ve reinvigorated our core offerings when I think the core offerings of a lot of our competitors are languishing, but more than today we also talked about where we\u2019re going in the future, how we\u2019re going to help customers get from where they are today to where they want to go particularly in integrating the cloud and how NetApp is going to continue to be relevant and a leader and an attractive opportunity going forward. So thanks again for your time and see you again in 90 days. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thanks for participating in today\u2019s program. This concludes the program. You may all disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. I would like to turn the call over to your host, Kris Newton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kris Newton : Hello, and thank you for joining us on our Q2 fiscal year 2015 earnings call. With me today are CEO, Tom Georgens; and CFO, Nick Noviello. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our Web site at netapp.com along with the earnings release, our financial tables, a historical supplemental data table and the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation. As a reminder, during today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2015, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. Such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and are being made as of today. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons. We described some of these reasons in our accompanying press release, which we have furnished to the SEC on a Form 8-K. Please refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC, specifically our Form 10-K for fiscal year 2014, subsequent Form 10-Q quarterly reports and our current reports on Form 8-K also on file with the SEC and available on our Web site. During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in today's press release and on our Web site. I'll now turn the call over to Tom for his commentary on the quarter. Tom Georgens : Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I am pleased with our performance in Q2. Revenue and non-GAAP EPS were both above the midpoint of our prior guidance range and we had another strong quarter of gross margin performance. The growth of large deals we saw in Q1 continued into Q2, helped by our U.S. public sector business. The rapid adoption of Clustered Data ONTAP, the industry\u2019s number one storage operating system continued in Q2 with shipments of Clustered nodes more than tripling year-over-year. The attach rate of Clustered ONTAP again increased across all of our product lines. The attach rate to our high-end platforms was 65%. For the midrange, it was 50% and we are seeing acceleration in the low-end with attach rates more than doubling from Q1. Total system unit shipped increased 6% from Q2 last year. We saw notable strength in E-Series branded and all-flash FAS. FlexPod, our converged architecture solution also continues to perform well with shipments up 50% from last year. We continue to see momentum with our broad portfolio of flash solutions as well. In Q2, our flash capacity shipped more than doubled year-over-year and we shipped FlashRay, our newest all-flash array to select customers. Before I talk more about our strategy and provide some insights into how it is resonating with customers, I\u2019ll pass it over to Nick to provide details on our Q2 results. Nick? Nick Noviello : Thank you, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. NetApp delivered another quarter of solid financial performance. As Tom highlighted, we achieved net revenues and EPS above the midpoint of our prior guidance ranges and are pleased with the adoption and momentum of NetApp\u2019s portfolio of innovations. Fiscal Q2 net revenues were $1.54 billion, up 4% sequentially and roughly flat on a year-over-year basis. Product revenue of $929 million was down 3% year-over-year while the combination of software entitlements and maintenance and services revenues of $613 million was up 3% year-over-year. NetApp branded revenue was 92% of net revenues for Q2 and at $1.42 billion was up 5% sequentially and up 2% year-over-year. OEM revenue of $119 million declined 8% sequentially and 22% from Q2 last year. Indirect revenue through the channels and OEMs accounted for 80% of Q2 net revenues and was down from Q2 last year, due to declines in OEM business. Excluding OEM, indirect revenue was roughly flat year-over-year. Arrow and Avent contributed 24% and 17% of net revenues, respectively. Geographic performance came in largely as expected and included a 51% sequential and 8% year-over-year increase in U.S. public sector revenues corresponding to the fiscal year end of the U.S. government. Non-GAAP gross margin of 65% was up 1.4 points from Q2 last year and above our prior guidance range. Non-GAAP product gross margin of 58.4% was up more than a point year-over-year benefiting from a combination of supply chain savings, favorable product mix and lower warranty costs. Service gross margin of 62.7% was slightly higher than anticipated due to a combination of higher support revenues and lower than expected spending on support infrastructure. Non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter was 17.8% in line with our previous guidance. We continue to invest selectively across the business to bring our innovative data management solutions for the hybrid cloud to customers. Consistent with our expectations, our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the second quarter was 16.5%. Q2 weighted average diluted share count of 323 million shares was below our prior guidance, down 6 million shares sequentially and down 26 million shares or 7% from Q2 last year, due to continued stock repurchase activity. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.70 was in line with our prior guidance range. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.3 billion in cash and investments, 16% of which is onshore. The sequential decrease in onshore cash was predominately due to shares repurchased in the quarter. Inventory turns were at 20 and days sales outstanding were 37. Deferred revenue of $3 billion was up $115 million from Q2 last year. Q2 cash from operations was $381 million versus $363 million in Q2 FY '14. Free cash flow was 21% of revenue in Q2 consistent with last year. In Q2, we returned $652 million to shareholders, $600 million in share repurchases and $52 million in cash dividends. Consistent with the guidance we provided this past May, we remain on track to complete our share repurchase program by the end of May 2015. Today, we also announced our next cash dividend of $0.165 per share of the company\u2019s stock to be paid on January 22, 2015. Now to guidance. We remain pleased with the momentum we see building in the business, but must remain conscious of the macro and industry dynamics as we continue to operate in a challenging environment. In Q3, we expect to bear the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange particularly the euro, which will have a negative impact on both sequential and year-over-year growth of about a point. As a result, our target revenue range for fiscal Q3 is $1.56 billion to $1.66 billion, which at the midpoint implies about 4% sequential growth and roughly flat revenue year-over-year. We expect fiscal Q3 non-GAAP gross margins to range from approximately 64% to 64.5% and non-GAAP operating margins to range from approximately 18% to 18.5%. Diluted share count for the quarter is expected to be approximately 320 million shares based on share repurchase activity in Q2 and in the first 10 days of Q3. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share for Q3 to range from approximately $0.74 to $0.79 per share. Our guidance reflects just over $0.02 of dilution from the combination of unfavorable foreign exchange as well as the net operating expenses related to the SteelStore product line acquisition, which closed at the beginning of Q3. As we move into the second half of the year, our overall fiscal 2015 revenue and EPS expectations remain unchanged. However, given the industry transition we continue to navigate through, we do expect some shift in the revenue mix with branded revenue growth for the year to be slightly lower than and a decline in OEM revenue to be less than our original expectations. Though ultimately dependent on revenue mix and growth, we expect non-GAAP gross margin just about 64% and non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 18% for fiscal 2015. We continue to expect our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the year to be about 16.5%. Full year non-GAAP EPS will reflect the net impact of foreign exchange for at least Q3, as well as about $0.03 of dilution from the SteelStore product line acquisition in the second half. Finally, we expect to continue to generate strong cash flow and as I indicated earlier remain on track to complete our existing share repurchase plan by the end of May 2015. In closing, we remain confident in our execution, our plans for the remainder of FY '15 and our long-term strategy. Our strong portfolio of solutions is well aligned with the evolving priorities of our customers. NetApp is uniquely positioned to help customers as they navigate the transformation of their IT deployments by providing a bridge from the choices of today to their requirements for the future. Now, I would like to turn the call back to Tom for some additional thoughts on our vision and how it aligns to customer priorities. Tom? Tom Georgens : Thanks, Nick. Two weeks ago, we held one of my favorite events, our annual technical conference, NetApp Insight. The energy level is always very high and in recent years, Insight has more turning points in the acceleration of products like Clustered ONTAP, branded E-Series and OnCommand Insight. This year for the first time, we invited customers. The excitement and endorsement of our technology and vision was remarkable. We highlighted our differentiated vision for the hybrid cloud as well as new software services and partnerships that support this vision. In just the past 90 days, we have introduced a significant number of new product offerings, including Data ONTAP 8.3, Cloud ONTAP, FlashRay, StorageGRID Webscale, expanded partnerships from NetApp private storage and the SteelStore product line acquisition. Many of these are the culminations of years of effort all coming together at the same time. We have never had a stronger portfolio of innovative solutions and never have been more impactful in creating great outcomes for our customers\u2019 businesses. We are pleased with our competitive position and performance in the first half of the year, but as Nick noted earlier, it\u2019s important to recognize that we continue to operate in a challenging environment. We have all seen the headlines of macroeconomic uncertainties; Russia, the European economy, FX headwinds, but more fundamentally our industry is in transition. Enterprises must manage their existing infrastructure and meet the growing demands of the business while at the same time adopting new technologies and delivery options. Cloud plays a key role in creating value for enterprise customers and we want to accelerate their ability to realize that value. There are compelling used cases for the cloud and there are workloads where our own infrastructure will be the preferred choice. Because of this, hybrid cloud will be the ultimate model with enterprise as having some element of traditional cloud, hyperscale cloud and on-premises computing in their IT environments. A hybrid model means that the cloud cannot be an island separate from everything else. The true value of the cloud can only be realized as a seamless extension of on-premises computing where two technologies integrate with the existing, mature, proven and compliance systems. Data is at the center of the hybrid cloud. It has a lifecycle that needs to be shared and integrated to deliver business value. Unfortunately, there is not one cloud. Today\u2019s clouds are a range of isolated, incompatible silos. To truly operationalize the cloud, customers need a way to converge the different data management environments between their clouds and their on-premise infrastructure. Our NetApp data fabric vision provides customers with the only consistent way to manage, secure and protect their data regardless of where they chose to put it. The NetApp data fabric weaves together to disparate data elements of the hybrid cloud into a single architecture giving customers control and choice with the flexibility, elasticity and ubiquity of cloud resources. Data ONTAP is the foundation of the NetApp data fabric. Clustered Data ONTAP delivers true software-defined functionality with a set of enterprise-wide data management capabilities independent of the underlying hardware. Clustered ONTAP enables customers to grow incrementally and non-disruptively with the flexibility of a wide range of deployment options; from converged and integrated systems to third-party arrays as well as software only and cloud options. With the latest major upgrade of Clustered ONTAP, we have made huge improvements across virtually everything criteria on which customers evaluate store solutions; performance, scalability, availability and efficiency. We dramatically increased our performance for flash getting all-flash FAS arrays performance levels ahead of our new entrants. We enhanced availability with the introduction of Metrocluster. We improved efficiency with in line pattern removal and advanced drive partitioning techniques, and we continue to simplify the customer experience of migration from both legacy NetApp and competing environments. By combining the elasticity and flexibility of cloud computing with the data management capabilities of Clustered ONTAP, the NetApp private storage solution set enables enterprises to take advantage of the cloud while minimizing risk. Customers can realize the flexibility and economic benefits of multi-cloud solutions without the risk and regulatory concerns associated with relinquishing data stewardship. The NetApp private storage solution ecosystem includes Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and our latest addition, IBM SoftLayer. Enterprises now really have a choice of cloud providers and the ability to select based on costs, performance and service levels. Cloud ONTAP extends the value of Clustered ONTAP into the cloud. Cloud ONTAP uses patented NetApp technologies for non-disruptive operations, seamless scalability and efficiency combining them with on-demand computing benefits of cloud services in a pay-as-you-go model. The initial release combines the world\u2019s leading storage operating system ONTAP with the world\u2019s leading public cloud Amazon Web Services. We have been in beta for several months with installed base customers and today announced its general availability. NetApp private storage and Cloud ONTAP demonstrate our commitment to enable customers to fully realize the flexibility and economics of hyperscale clouds and to do so as a seamless extension of their on-premises environment. NetApp creates the ability to leverage the instant scale of the cloud to accelerate time to deployment of new applications, to reduce the risk in investment for temporary or speculative workloads and to transfer high activity workloads back to owned infrastructure for better economics. Hybrid cloud done correctly means better speed, innovation and economics with greater responsiveness to the needs of the business. Cloud also makes sense to low utilization workloads like backup and archiving. Enterprises are looking for more cost effective ways to manage this data and are considering cloud storage as an option. To that end, we recently acquired the SteelStore product line from Riverbed, which enables customers to extend their existing data protection infrastructure into the cloud. Customers are able to reduce the complexity of disc-to-disc and tape-based backup while reducing storage costs with in-line deduplication and compression. Today, we announced the availability of the SteelStore product as well as an Amazon machine image option, which will be available later this quarter. To help customers manage large scale data repositories, we recently introduced StorageGRID Webscale which automatically stores and manages repositories of billions of objects globally across multiple data centers, clouds and cost tiers. Customers can define policies that automate how and where data is stored and protected based on cost, performance, accessibility and durability needs. Additionally, because StorageGRID Webscale is built for the hybrid cloud, organizations can store data in the right place, at the right time and take advantage of on-premises or public cloud environments as need dictate with the ability to move back and forth dynamically. All of these innovations support our vision of a fully operationalized hybrid cloud. Unlike the positioning of other suppliers, we are not diminishing the potential of a hyperscale cloud nor are we steering customers to a proprietary cloud. We are unambiguously stating that for important subset of workloads the hyperscale cloud will deliver value to our customers. Our strategy is to enable customers to realize that value by making hyperscale integration to existing environments as seamless and operationally secure as possible. Our portfolio of data management solutions improves the economics, flexibility and business impact of customers existing infrastructure while giving them confidence in our ability to help them navigate the hybrid cloud future. In the last few months, we have dramatically expanded the NetApp portfolio at a pace unprecedented in our history. We introduced Data ONTAP 8.3, Cloud ONTAP, FlashRay, StorageGRID Webscale, expanded NetApp private storage and FlexPod solution ecosystems and acquired the SteelStore product line. We expect each of these products to lead in their categories prevailing over competitors both large and small. Our best of breed solutions are compelling for existing requirements and are integrated to a much broader vision of the hybrid cloud that only NetApp can deliver. The integration of the public cloud is driving a fundamental transformation of IT creating more opportunities for IT to deliver competitive advantage for the businesses than ever before. But these opportunities come with risk. Our vision supported by products that are available now is fueling our participation and leadership in this transition. Only NetApp has a strategy that gives customers a seamless path to the hybrid cloud and the ability to manage their data across clouds and on-premises environments. Before opening the call for Q&A, I would like to express my sincere appreciation to the over 12,000 employees of NetApp for all their work and dedication. We, again, received strong placement in the World\u2019s Best Multinational Workplaces list by the Great Place to Work Institute. NetApp\u2019s unique culture is a differentiator that helps us produce great results for NetApp customers and partners. We will now open up the call for Q&A. As always, I ask you to be respectful of your peers on the call and limit yourself to one question, so we can address as many people as possible. Thank you. Operator? Operator : (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Your line is open. Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal : Yes. Thank you. Tom, I wanted to go with you, if I could, and if you could just talk a little bit about the branded product revenue and that if I impute what you\u2019re guiding to, it looks like you\u2019re guiding to about mid single digit branded product revenue, which is the first time that you would reach mid single digits in I think 10 or 12 quarters than kind of plus or minus zero. And yet it sounds like, to be fair, you\u2019re down taking a little bit on your expectations associated with branded product revenue and I was hoping you could just talk a little bit about why you think your growth potential is lower than what you had previously expected? Tom Georgens : Yes. I think all things considered, I think things are more or less in line of what we expected. I\u2019d say the thing that\u2019s probably a variance certainly going into this quarter is really the impact of FX. And the FX impact is overwhelmingly on the branded side as opposed to the OEM side given the nature of that business. So I think the trajectory that we talked about for the branded business I think is very, very much intact. It\u2019s certainly modulated by the FX component, so I don\u2019t feel like we\u2019re communicating anything different than what we\u2019ve been saying all along. I think the momentum is there. Certainly the portfolio build just in the last 90 days, you think about the products we just brought to market, literally it will take time to ramp but if I look at the trajectory that we\u2019re on, it\u2019s substantially unchanged. I really don\u2019t have anything to add to the equation expect for the FX impact, which is overwhelmingly on branded. Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal : Okay. So literally, it was just FX then. Tom Georgens : Yes. A point is a real number in a low growth market, so for us if we had that point back, I don\u2019t think we\u2019d be having this discussion. Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal : Okay. Nick Noviello : Keith, I\u2019m going to add in on that just for everybody else as well. In terms of the Q3 guidance, it is that point of FX that is really from a revenue perspective and we both had calls earlier certainly on the press side of the fence and really on Q3, it\u2019s FX. That\u2019s it in terms of any difference from what we would have expected earlier. And then on the EPS line, you need to think about the SteelStore acquisition and the combination of those two on the EPS line is about $0.02. Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal : All right, fair enough, because you\u2019re certainly not the only company experiencing FX challenges. Nick Noviello : Correct. Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal : If I could just sneak in why the corresponding question and as my follow up is you mentioned the OEM business is a little bit better. Should we be thinking about the same longer term considerations for the FX as a percent of total revenues or product revenues? Is this a temporary little bit better or do you think there are some larger opportunities here associated with the OEM business? That\u2019s it from me. Thank you. Nick Noviello : Yes, so let me start on that and hopefully we\u2019ll be able to keep the one question thing. But on the OEM side of the fence, most of that business is conducted in U.S. dollars. So we don\u2019t have too much of an FX impact there to think about. It\u2019s mostly on the branded side, as Tom indicated. And we said that the OEM business could be off up to 40% this year. It\u2019s obviously not at that point so far for the first half. This is dynamic as business declines and in certain areas business is declining substantially and significantly and you can think about the N series business as the perfect example of that. There\u2019s other businesses that we expected some pretty substantial declines on and are a little bit lumpy on the way down. So those are all things we have to think about. And so as we modulate these branded and OEM numbers just a little bit, we\u2019re being conscious of those things. Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal : Many thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. Your line is open. Nehal Chokshi - Maxim Group : I\u2019d like to dig more into Cloud ONTAP. You spent a lot of time on that, I appreciate that. But the realization of cloud bursting, I want to be clear. Is that something that is enabled within this current version of general availability or is that something that will become available? And I have a follow up based on that answer. Tom Georgens : We want to keep to one, so \u2013 one question. I think Cloud ONTAP is ONTAP and so depending on your definition of cloud bursting, effectively what it\u2019s going to look like is another instantiation of an ONTAP system. So all of the way that you would manage a system that was on-premise running ONTAP, this would just look like an actual extension of that. So all the SnapMirror technology, all the data moving technology, the multiprotocol, all of those are built into this application. So if cloud bursting is can I run an application here and then can I run instantiation on it in the cloud and can I move my data over with SnapMirror, the answer to that is yes. Nehal Chokshi - Maxim Group : Okay. What I\u2019m precisely talking about is that say you have a highly variable workload and you don\u2019t want to buy physical resources on-premise for the baseline and that you want to burst it into the public cloud for the peak workloads. Can you do that? Tom Georgens : The answer to that is yes. However, in general you\u2019re going to want the applications in relatively close proximity to the data. So if you had two copies of that data that would be viable, or if you had an application that run for a long time and you can move the data and then run the application. Probably a better alternative to that is actually NetApp private storage. What NetApp private storage is, is you basically have the data on your network and you connect to the high bandwidth pipes to Amazon and Microsoft and now SoftLayer. So effectively you can have one copy of the data and execute on it with your internal computing capabilities and if you need extra compute capabilities on that same piece of data on your network, you can have access to the elastic compute of Amazon, Microsoft or SoftLayer. So in that latter situation, I think that\u2019s a better match for the used case that you decide. There are other used cases for Cloud ONTAP like backup and DR and things of that nature. So I\u2019d say that we have all of those used cases covered in a very, very unique and differentiated way and that\u2019s why there\u2019s so much momentum around this cloud story and a lot of response from the Insight that we just did last week. Nehal Chokshi - Maxim Group : Right. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank : Hi. Thanks. Nick, I was hoping you could provide a little detail about what you\u2019re thinking about gross margins longer term? They were a bit better than expected and I know that you called out supply chain savings and some favorable mix. In this quarter, guidance looks a little bit lower in terms of gross margin expectations. Just wanted to get more detail on how we should think about it longer term? Nick Noviello : Sure, Sherri. I think that in terms of longer term being the year, first, we took that up a bit and you probably noticed that in the text this time versus last time around. In terms of the three-year, the gross margin guidance is really unchanged. We\u2019re getting benefit from a variety of things we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re getting benefit from mix of business, mix of revenue in the business. So as we have higher margin, pieces of our services businesses higher margin that rolling through that\u2019s going to benefit us. OEM mix will change things as well. But as we\u2019ve talked about in prior quarters, we have done a substantial amount of work that we feel good about around the supply chain side of the fence. We\u2019re also seeing the benefit of warranty that\u2019s speaking to other things that we have worked very hard on over time. So I think that this all comes together and is consistent. We in essence brought up the year a little bit in the gross margin side, so FY '15, so you should expect to see that in the second half here. But the overall guidance and the overall expectations of strong gross margins based on that value proposition of what we\u2019re selling is consistent. Tom Georgens : One thing I\u2019d add is certainly I\u2019d echo Nick\u2019s comments. I think the execution intensity of the company on many fronts, including this one in terms of gross margin generation and likewise engineering and delivery I think had ratchet up dramatically over the course of the last couple of years. But the other thing in terms of long-term guidance on gross margin is, we reserve the right to use that as a competitive knob. We certainly see aging infrastructures of our competitors out there that are not really being refreshed and not really seeing any innovation. And the opportunity to attack them aggressively with now a refreshed Clustered ONTAP and the new offerings that we have and generally a lot of those attacks are not our highest margin transactions on day one. So the ability to use the gross margin strength of the company as a competitive weapon to attack aging infrastructures of our competition is something that we\u2019re going to reserve the right to do. So as we think about our long-term gross margin, not only is it the operational excellence that Nick and the team are driving but it\u2019s also the competitive choices that we\u2019re going to make. Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank : Thank you, Tom. And can I just ask a follow up in terms of the\u2026 Tom Georgens : This is the third follow up. I think we probably need to keep it fair, otherwise we won\u2019t get to the entire list. I\u2019m sorry. Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank : Okay. Operator : Our next question comes from Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs : Thank you. How are you thinking about federal trends now as we head into the January quarter after obviously a nice rebound this quarter? Should it be normal seasonal declines? And I guess related to that, do you think your visibility here is now improving to normal levels or is it still a bit lumpy? Nick Noviello : Yes. So why don\u2019t I start on the seasonal decline. So, yes, we expect seasonal declines and in fact they are substantial. In many years we\u2019ve had a Q2 to Q3 sequential decline in federal revenues in the 40% range plus. So we would expect that same thing again. And that doesn\u2019t mean we feel good, better and different. It\u2019s just the seasonality of the business. I think that we have seen stabilization out there, that\u2019s good. I think our position \u2013 and Tom can speak to it better than I, our position continues to be very strong on the federal side of the fence. Tom Georgens : Certainly a year ago we were facing sequestration at the end of the government\u2019s fiscal year and then a shutdown in the month of October when trying to close a quarter. So obviously compared to that, it was a lot more pleasant but frankly it was \u2013 I think the team did a really good job there. I would say that federal spending wasn\u2019t massively robust but nonetheless it was much more predictable and much more understandable. And with the 8% year-over-year growth better than on the booking side, I think there\u2019s no doubt that we gained share in that segment. The team continues to execute well. I think going forward, I think that traditional seasonality from quarter-to-quarter is what we would expect. Obviously a change in Congress may have some impact on the funding side but absent that, I think that the federal business pretty much operated on its normal cadence through most of the last year, and I think we got our disproportionate share of it. Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from James Kisner with Jefferies. Your line is open. James Kisner - Jefferies & Co.: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. I\u2019ll keep it to one. So, we\u2019ve been hearing about some layoffs in VCE post the consolidation of ownership there. I\u2019m just wondering do you guys see any incremental opportunities as a result of that? Thank you. Tom Georgens : The short answer to that is yes. I think clearly the trajectory of the business and the underlying relationship there has been problematic for some time. And certainly while this is the latest news, we\u2019ve certainly seen deeper and deeper engagement with Cisco with NetApp around more and more strategic matters going forward around products and co-development and co-marketing, including a lot of joint appearances and a lot of joint events with executives. So, from our perspective, this is just the latest in the news but the trajectory over the last year clearly has been lots more engagement not just on a product side \u2013 I should say not just on a sales side but from a product and strategy side going forward and we\u2019re very, very, very closely aligned with Cisco\u2019s strategic initiatives going forward. So I think the answer to that question is yes, but I\u2019d say that that didn\u2019t just start last month with the announcement. I think the announcement was a culmination of a broader transition and we\u2019ve seen that activity over the last year and the results of which you\u2019ll see in the market next year. James Kisner - Jefferies & Co.: Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research. Your line is open. Steven Fox - Cross Research : Just one question from me. Tom, you highlighted a very robust product roadmap that\u2019s coming to market now. Is there any way you can put a little color on how it impacts revenues over time? When you would think we\u2019d see something show up in the financials that maybe is different from the trends you\u2019re talking about and whether there\u2019s any customer application trends that maybe could drive it faster in the near future? Thanks a lot. Tom Georgens : Well, I think the revenue impact is expected to be up and I think as far as the trend goes, I think they\u2019re on a bunch of different fronts. I think as far as the Clustered ONTAP announcements of 8.3, in a lot of ways that a culmination release of really the last of the major features that have been holding back some of our customers on the transition front, which is particularly Metrocluster. Certain segments of our market have used that to compete and compete effective and have turned it into almost in every unit item and waiting for that has been an important component of that. So I think there\u2019s some pent-up demand there clearly around people have been waiting for that technology as a precondition to consider transition. Now they will transition as equipment ages and equipment comes to end of its usable life, so won\u2019t happen overnight. But I still see that 8.3 will generate the next and last major tranche of people that will begin the transition process. As far as StorageGRID, clearly the opportunity to do Webscale storage is a conversation that we have with a lot of customers, a lot of our service providers both in the U.S. and international. And I think that\u2019s a segment of the market where we had not been able to participate in the past, so I think that opens up new segments to us. FlashRay continuing on the evolution of flash adding to the portfolio EF and all-flash FAS and now FlashRay, so I think that lays out our portfolio there which I think is bigger and broader than anybody\u2019s in the industries. So I think all of that is couched against a challenging economic backdrop. So from our point of view is we\u2019re not going to forecast the macro. Certainly none of the guidance that Nick and I gave you is anticipating any fundamental change in the macro backdrop, but I believe that our competitiveness today in terms of a refresh of our core technology and additions to the portfolio on top of that not to mention the SteelStore acquisition, I think we have a lot more to sell today than we had six months ago even. So I think that bodes well. The rate of the turnaround, clearly there are other factors that we can\u2019t control. All we can control is our pace of innovation, our ability to sell and service customers and I feel really good about that. Steven Fox - Cross Research : Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks again. Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Wittine with Longbow Research. Your line is open. Joe Wittine - Longbow Research : Hi. Thanks. Maybe I\u2019ll shift over to cash deployments. So it seems like you pulled in some of the buyback, at least from a linear perspective, and the vast majority is now complete. Nick, I understand you won\u2019t put out any numbers today but can you at least help investors understand whether NetApp, the Board, et cetera, has the appetite to continue cash returns in excess of free cash flow into '15 or is it more likely you revert back to kind of a steady state that is below free cash flow, let\u2019s say? Nick Noviello : Hi, Joe. So first of all, we have on the original plan for this year we have 400 million in change to go as of the end of the second quarter. So we\u2019ve got a good chunk remaining ahead of us and the plan was that through May of 2015, we will deploy the rest of that. And we talk about the capital allocation at every Board meeting. Our Board is very sensitive to their share repurchase, dividends and the overall philosophy there. And I think in terms of the guidance we gave that guidance is consistent. So at this point in time, we will look at all of those pieces on a going forward basis both repurchases and dividends. We will finish out this current authorization by May of 2015. The Board is having that kind of a conversation around the next authorization and all of those pieces, and we\u2019ll announce more as it makes sense to announce more on those things. The strategy and the things that I laid out at our financial Analyst Day in May are consistent until we say something else, frankly. Operator : Our next question comes from Ben Reitzes with Barclays. Your line is open. Ben Reitzes - Barclays Capital : Hi. Thanks. Tom, can you discuss Cloud ONTAP a little more? And what percent of your customer base do you think that will appeal to? And do you think it will have a cannibalistic effect on revenues or a more synergistic effect? And then I just want to sneak this in, if you could just clarify whether \u2013 material revenue contribution from SteelStore is in your guidance? Thanks. Tom Georgens : The latter question is no; no material contribution of SteelStore. We need to get up at that in going and we need to \u2013 obviously we need to scrub the pipeline and we need to get first-hand knowledge there. So I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to bake that in at this point. Ben Reitzes - Barclays Capital : Thanks. Tom Georgens : The broader question on Clustered ONTAP is I think you need to think about Clustered ONTAP in the big picture and not a standalone product. The goal here for NetApp is while lots of people talk about the cloud in the context of it\u2019s a jungle, it\u2019s dangerous, it\u2019s risky and those are awfully euphemisms for we hope it doesn\u2019t happen. I also see a lot of the cloud conversations around steering people to proprietary clouds and our view is that Amazon is going to make a big investment, as is Microsoft and SoftLayer. They are going to create a set of capabilities whether it be around flexibility, around certain workloads and cost around certain workloads that are going to be compelling to the enterprise. And our task and our goal and our strategy is to make it possible for them to bring the hyperscale cloud in and make it look like a seamless extension of what they do on-premise. So there\u2019s no ambiguity about our position on the public cloud. It\u2019s going to make sense for a set of workloads, our job is to operationalize it. So the broader question isn\u2019t so much about Cloud ONTAP as a point product, it\u2019s about Cloud ONTAP as a completion of a strategy. I can run ONTAP on my hardware, I can run ONTAP on other people\u2019s hardware, I can run ONTAP in the virtual machine on-premise, I can do NetApp private storage where you can keep your storage but use the compute form of Amazon and I can run in Amazon. So all those options are now available to the customer with one set of tools, one set of processes, one set of software, and that\u2019s my definition of software-defined stores is basically a set of common functionality across all instantiations at all locations of data. That\u2019s the big picture. Now as far as Clustered ONTAP, we\u2019re not viewing it as a point product. We\u2019re viewing it as an essential part of a strategy that\u2019s going to enable NetApp to become the enterprise data management standard. So, yes, we\u2019ll cannibalize some business, it will also allow us to monetize data to the cloud. More importantly, as we can become more ubiquitous as the enterprise data management standard, we can bring more of the data management both in the cloud and on-premise over time and that\u2019s the real push on this technology. So Cloud ONTAP is not a point product. Certainly it can be bought and procured that way, but it\u2019s part of a much broader strategy to ultimately create seamless data management across the entire enterprise, across all media. That\u2019s what we want to do. Ben Reitzes - Barclays Capital : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Maynard Um with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Maynard Um - Wells Fargo : Hi. Thank you. Can you talk a little bit about your channel? And if with the new opportunities, you think there have to be shifts, because I think one thing that came out of Insight was that NetApp\u2019s professional services team is now available to channel partners and I\u2019m wondering if that suggest greater complexity in the sales process or suggest the potential for higher costs. I was just hoping if you could just share a little bit of color around your thoughts on channel in general in context of the changes in the industry. Thanks. Tom Georgens : Well, I think we want to get crisper about our channel positioning over time that professional \u2013 to separate these two points. Professional services is an essential part of customer success with our technology. And there\u2019s a need for that in our enterprise accounts and there\u2019s a need for that with our channel partners. We want to focus our professional services around accounts that either expect or demand that that service comes directly from us around very, very complex services or around things only NetApp can do, which would mean things that usually have an engineering modification component. The rest of the business for the purpose of velocity, we want to have our channel partners do. It\u2019s a big business opportunity for them. We don\u2019t want to be competing with them for it. So in general, not just around professional services but even around go-to-market, we\u2019re looking for our channel partners to become more self-sufficient, more capable both on the pre-sell side and the post-sell side. So they can basically drive more of our business in the midsized business and NetApp can focus its dedicated resources in the enterprise. So over time, I think we want to be much, much clearer about our delineation of our staff between our support of the midsized business, which is mostly through channel partners, which means a significant investment on our part to get them up to speed and capable and competent. It also means that we\u2019re not competing with them for business. So they are at a position to make a much bigger commitment to NetApp because our objectives are quite clear. And likewise, as we see a rebound and strength in growth of large deals, those are things that we want to capture and we want to cultivate and we want to have more of our NetApp direct resources working in our largest enterprise accounts driving big opportunities and big business for us. So over time, we want to be very clear about our delineation of our skills and where we\u2019re going to deploy our resources. We want our best channel partners to be more capable and more competent and we will steer more business their way and we will give them the support that they need and we want to focus our direct resources on the big accounts and the big opportunities. And we talked about that at financial Analyst Day in terms of the segments that matter to us and I think we\u2019re six months into transition now and so far so good. Operator : Our next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley : Yes. Thanks. The midpoint of January guidance assumes the same 4% sequential growth as you reported a year ago even though you have a tougher U.S. public comp from the October quarter this time around, you have the FX headwind and you\u2019ve talked about some mixed macro. So is there something that\u2019s driving more confidence around the January quarter versus the last few and especially relative to the year ago? Nick Noviello : I think all those data points are true. I think we have more things to sell and I think that our story in terms of the cloud and Insight and hopefully the catalyst that that will provide. We did our Las Vegas event last week. We\u2019re doing our European event next week. So if I look going forward, I certainly wouldn\u2019t consider the forecast euphoric. As you point out we certainly have FX headwinds and other things. On the other hand, I think our competitive position only gets better. We really don\u2019t have any aging products. Just about everything of substance is either brand new or it has just been updated and I just feel that our competitive position is stronger than it\u2019s been in some time. And at the end of the day, 4% isn\u2019t 15% either. So I want to be pushing hard, I want to set high goals, I want to be cognizant of the world around us. But the simple fact of the matter is I think our competitive position today is better than it was six months or a year ago. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Andrew Nowinski - Piper Jaffray : Thank you. Maybe just from a geographic perspective, I know you said that the regions came in largely as expected, but the 2.9% decline in Europe looks like it\u2019s the worst it\u2019s been since Q1 of 2012. So do you think you could see any sort of market share loss in that region or was it more related to disruption in Ukraine and the overall macro? Thanks. Tom Georgens : On those numbers, there\u2019s also the OEM business that\u2019s wrapped into that. If I think about bookings, which is probably a more indicative of the current state of the business, they continue to be quite strong and they were definitely in positive territory. There is no doubt that the Russian sanctions had some complexity in terms of who we can sell to and the velocity of fulfillment and that certainly had some impact on the business but not enough to talk about. So we certainly see the Russian and Ukraine influence and I think that that\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s not zero but not material. It\u2019s a few million dollars. But at the end of the day, I think in light of all of these headlines around Europe in general and Germany in particular, those teams continue to execute well. So when I look from a booking perspective, I would say that looking at bookings I don\u2019t see our performance commensurate with the headlines and we certainly hope that that continues. But right now FX is a bigger concern than the overall economic condition in terms of impacting our Germany business in particular. Nick Noviello : Yes, I would also add to that that our European business in the second quarter at 28% or 29% of overall revenue is right in line with what we\u2019ve seen over the last several years. Andrew Nowinski - Piper Jaffray : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Alexander with Raymond James. Your line is open. Brian Alexander - Raymond James : All right. Thank you. Nick, if I look at the deferred revenue, long-term deferred hasn\u2019t really grown year-over-year in the last four quarter but your short-term deferred is up about 6% to 8% over that same timeframe. So I realize product revenue growth has been a bit lackluster and that\u2019s a major factor here, and maybe customers are renewing maintenance on a shorter term basis as they prolong their product refresh activity. Is there anything else driving the wedge between short-term and long-term deferred and is there anything we should take away from either maintenance attach rates or maintenance pricing that\u2019s driving that gap? Thanks. Nick Noviello : I think your point around what customers do on the renewal side, what they do as they understand more and more about what Clustered ONTAP can do to them but they want to make those transitions when it makes sense from an operational perspective, when it makes sense from a financial perspective and all those pieces, I think that\u2019s really the key here. There\u2019s nothing outside of the renewal cycle and what\u2019s going on with that that would really be driving this. Remember, every one of those contracts with customers have their own term to them, their own value in the overall contract to them. Sometimes those are standalone type of transactions, sometimes they are tied up with other product sales, but there is nothing overall or an umbrella concept that I would say would be changing things here. But this point about renewing for shorter periods of time while customers are getting ready for a Clustered ONTAP transition, that absolutely makes sense. Brian Alexander - Raymond James : I was just going to follow up and say, you would still say the change in deferred going forward should be a positive contributor to cash flow. Nick Noviello : Deferred revenue is absolutely a positive contributor. Brian Alexander - Raymond James : Okay. Tom Georgens : And I will echo Nick\u2019s comments. I think one of them clearly a short-term renewals on equipment, whether it\u2019s because budgets can\u2019t support a tech refresh at this time whether it\u2019s because they\u2019re waiting to do a Clustered ONTAP transition, whether they\u2019re waiting for 8.3, I think all of those are factors that would be indicative of a lot of equipment that is getting closer and closer to its need for tech refresh. When that actual transition occurs, obviously it\u2019s going to be a function to budget. But I think the general case of as we go through and we talked about revenue growth, we should not also lose sight of the fact that we had over $100 million of year-over-year growth in the deferred revenue balance. So once again, indicative of the growth of the business, a fair amount of our transactions have a current revenue component and a deferred component and that\u2019s an important indicator of our overall business levels as well just as important as the revenue. Brian Alexander - Raymond James : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Mitch Steves - RBC Capital Markets : Hi. This is Mitch Steves filling in for Amit. One quick question on FlashRay. Do you guys expect that to be a material driver for branded growth? And how should we think about that product relative to the EF540 array? Tom Georgens : It is going to be a branded product, so all the FlashRay product will be in the branded category. In terms of the overall portfolio, I think that there\u2019s several points. The EF product is optimized for just raw performance and the classic workload that we see there is database acceleration, the data migration and the data placement is managed by the application itself typically Oracle and ASM. And the key differentiator there is high availability, because a lot of those environments have very, very high availability requirements, they tend to be very, very mission-critical, high-performance applications. So the maturity of the EF family which has been doing high availability longer than NetApp in fact allows us to compete for that very, very high performance with high availability. And the high availability requirement disqualifies a lot of the start-ups. As far as FlashRay, it\u2019s less around raw brute performance although obviously it\u2019s a flash array and performance is an important characteristic, but it\u2019s really that married with data management and married with storage efficiency. So the ability to deliver performance and with compelling always on storage efficiency and very, very compelling ease of use is really the positioning for FlashRay. All-flash FAS is also a critical part of this story, but I think you should think about that as we certainly sell it certainly today as a point all-flash product competing against some of the other products and particularly with 8.3, the performance characteristics were remarkable; in fact clearly outperforming the biggest competitors in that space including the newly architected designs. But the way to think about all-flash FAS beyond just a point product is imagine all-flash FAS not as a standalone all-flash array but as a node in the cluster. And you can have an all-flash FAS and a cluster as a high performance device and then next to it you can have a machine that\u2019s got 2,000 disc drives that\u2019s optimized for capacity and you can use all of our transparent volume migration that\u2019s already part of Clustered ONTAP to do the data migrations, the data ages so you\u2019ll always have fresh space for your high-performance data in the flash. Or you could basically distribute the flash to the entire cluster and use all of our scale-out capabilities to do that. So from our point of view whether it\u2019s the raw performance used case, whether it\u2019s the general purpose efficient used case like a FlashRay or whether it\u2019s the business critical and traditional business app worst case as part of a clustered solution with all-flash FAS, that\u2019s a pretty broad landscape and nobody else can match that. So from our perspective, I think we feel great about the portfolio. I think we see FlashRay in customers\u2019 hands getting great feedback on the performance and the ease of use and the efficiency, getting a bigger and bigger role. So simply put, EF all about performance; FlashRay around performance with efficiency and all-flash FAS around network stores for business applications using all of the premium features that\u2019s available in ONTAP but with the speed of flash. Operator : Our last question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Your line is open. Jim Suva - Citigroup: Thanks very much. Just kind of looking at the big picture and strategy, you guys have also gone through some restructuring recently. If I remember correctly, a lot of indications show that you\u2019re redeploying some of those restructurings into reinvesting into the business. Can you confirm kind of if that\u2019s true and are we seeing the fruit of that reinvestment happening now or when should we see it? Because you got to kind of scratch your head a little bit when you see that year-over-year it looks like net income is not growing and maybe it simply just takes some time to harvest some of the reinvestments and when should we see it happen? Thank you. Nick Noviello : Jim, let me start with this but yes, when we talked about the work we did last year, this is really about repositioning. This is really about setting our portfolio for the go forward, right, and a point that we were going to reinvest in the business in those areas where we were going to see or we believe we were going to get the biggest return in the future. That ramps up. So the investment comes in over a period of time and I think largely the investment is in now. And then that investment gets on to those productive activities to yield returns. So those are all part of the plan, those are all things we are doing, we\u2019ve invested in and we\u2019re doing going forward. Tom Georgens : Yes. One thing I\u2019d point out is that there\u2019s actually been two restructurings. One last year and the year before and a key component of those restructurings was to reposition resources against high priority activities for us. And if you look at what we\u2019ve just announced since we last met on this call, we\u2019ve announced FlashRay, we\u2019ve announced StorageGRID Webscale, Cloud ONTAP, ONTAP 8.3. Resources redeployed against those activities is why those activities exist and why they exist now. So the things that we did just this past year, some of them are reflected in those activities and some of those are reflected in future innovation and future investments not only on the product side but also on the go-to-market side and services side. So I think no doubt I believe our headcount today is higher than it was before we did the restructuring. We are doing the restructuring because we were out of ideas and we didn\u2019t know what to spend money on. We did those restructuring because we had a lot of ideas that we wanted to get on and get our resources aligned to it, and I think we did that. So I guess just to wrap up, I guess just kind of the summary. Where we are, I think it\u2019s a challenging environment but the business performed as we expected. If we look about the rest of the year, I think absent the dilution of the SteelStore and the FX, I think the EPS and the revenue for the year are more or less what we said they were going to be when we last talked to you. So I think we see consistently in the rest of the year, despite a fair number of moving parts. Probably for us, I\u2019d say probably the two big headline things for us since we last met; big portfolio build out and the products that I just mentioned. Obviously, the acquisition of SteelStore on top of that and I also think that we\u2019ve become a lot crisper in our messaging and communication with not only our internal audiences but now with customers and analysts and the community around our hybrid cloud strategy. And key elements of that whether it\u2019d be NetApp private storage or Cloud ONTAP are now reeling in the market. So when I think about just the raw technology and where we are today, our go-forward story about the hybrid cloud and the prove points against it, I feel really good about what we\u2019ve accomplished certainly over the last 90 days and the last year. So thanks for your time. Hopefully, see you all again next quarter. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s program.

Operator : Good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the NetApp's Thirds Quarter Fiscal Year 2015 Financial Earnings Conference Call.  At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will have a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions].  I would now like to turn the call over to Kris Newton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kris Newton : Hello, and thank you for joining us on our Q3 fiscal year 2015 earnings call. With me today are CEO, Tom Georgens; and CFO, Nick Noviello. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com along with the earnings release, our financial tables, a historical supplemental data table and the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation. As a reminder, during today's call we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2015, all of which involve risk and uncertainty.  Such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and are being made as of today. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons. We described some of these reasons in our accompanying press release, which we have furnished to the SEC on a Form 8-K. Please refer to the documents we filed from time-to-time with the SEC, specifically our Form 10-K for fiscal year 2014, subsequent Form 10-Q quarterly reports and our current reports on Form 8-K also on file with the SEC and available on our website. During the call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in today's press release and on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Tom for his commentary on the quarter. Tom Georgens : Thank you, Kris and good afternoon everyone. We are clearly disappointed with our top line performance in Q3 and are committed to taking the steps necessary to get back on track.  Despite the soft revenue we delivered another quarter of solid operational performance with improved gross margins from Q3 a year ago, and non-GAAP operation margin at the high end of our prior guidance. We further reduced diluted share count and delivered EPS within our previous guidance range. We remain confident in the fundamentals of our business and continue to make progress against our hybrid class strategy.  Top line revenue finished below the low end of our guidance, impacted by greater than anticipated FX movement in the quarter, which Nick will quantify shortly, as well as our own sales execution issues.  EMEA and APAC were impacted by FX, U.S. public sector driven by strong performance in federal had the highest growth, but Americas Commercial fell sort of expectations. The Americas team bullied by the increase in enterprise large deal activity in the first half of the fiscal year was optimistic about their forecast. Deals over $1 million increased yet again in Q3, but we also saw a significant number of large deals slip out of the quarter. We have new leadership in global and Americas sales and I\u2019m confident in the team and fully expect execution to improve. Looking ahead, we see FX headwinds impacting growth for not only NetApp but our customers as well. As companies lower their revenue expectations for the coming calendar year, there is an increase deferral of IT projects. We clearly saw that in January.  Anticipated budget was no longer available as companies delivered updated spending targets for the new calendar year and deals that were pushed out may not return in the near term. We are seeing large tech refresh opportunities being replaced with one-year support renewals and indications that customers remain committed to NetApp, but do not have budget to upgrade at this time. Despite the revenue short fall we continue to make progress in key areas. As I mentioned earlier, Q3 marked our third consecutive quarter of growth in large deals, a point of validation of our enterprise strategy. In November we further delivered against our data fabric vision with the availability of NetApp private stores for IBM software, the SteelStore appliance and Cloud ONTAP for Amazon web services.  We also introduced the newest version of Data ONTAP the industry\u2019s number one storage operating system, Data ONTAP 8.3. To-date ONTAP 8.3 has had the fastest ramp of any of our Clustered ONTAP software release introductions. Shipments of Clustered nodes grew 160% from Q3 a year ago. The attached rate of Clustered ONTAP continues to increase and now stands at roughly 40% of FAS controller shift in the quarter. Total system units shipped increased 9% from Q3 last year. We saw notable strength in E-Series branded and configurations of all flash FAS. The entirety of our portfolio has been refreshed over the past year with the recent launch of the E560 and the EF560. We continue to see sustained momentum with our broad flash portfolio as flash capacity shipped grew 69% year-over-year.  With FlashRay innovation injected into all flash FAS and the new EF560, we anticipate that our all FlashRay systems will soon hold two of the top spots in the industry performance benchmark. OnCommand Insight also continues to perform well with the number of deals increasing from Q3 a year ago. Overall we are confident with our portfolio and pleased with the growth of our emerging products.  As we have discussed in the past both the market and the enterprise IT are undergoing a major transition. Likewise NetApp has been undergoing a transition to position ourselves for the future as we talked about at our analyst day last June.  The NetApp data fabric vision, our seemliest hybrid cloud strategy is up leveling the nature of the conversations we are having with customers. We have delivered an unprecedented portfolio expansion, including new offerings in flash, object and cloud integration. We further augmented our cloud integration with the SteelStore product line acquisition.  We have also highlighted the internal productivity, efficiency and supply line initiatives that have resulted in gross margin and operating margin improvements despite a very challenging growth environment. We have increased emphasis on our enterprise and cloud service provider customers while maintaining the momentum we have in midsize business. We are seeing progress with our go-to- market transformation, but it\u2019s still a work in process and in need of ongoing improvement and investment. The increase in the breadth of the portfolio and our compelling data fabric vision are yielding positive results, but its clear in order to fully realize the value of these new capabilities, we must expand our go-to-market capacity with greater account coverage, product specialist and partner enablement. Clustered Data ONTAP currently meets the technical requirements of our largest and most demanding customers. We believe NetApp\u2019s engagement, helping them execute the transition to Clustered ONTAP over the next year will unlock differed Tech Refresh. In prior years go-to-market capacity expansion in times of high confidence in the portfolio proved to be a growth driver, even in difficult environments. We believe we are in a similar situation today. We also understand the imperative to deliver shareholder value in a low growth environment and the resulting pressure on operating expenses. We will continue to employ the discipline of shifting resources away from lower yield activities, as well as driving productivity and efficiency through the organization to offset as much as possible the impact of high priority investments to expand capacity. Overall the growth of the emerging products, the uptake of Clustered ONTAP and the resonance of our vision with customers, as well as our operational focus have been on a positive trajectory. All of this only compounds our disappointment with our performance last quarter.  External factors such as FX with clear headwinds, but our focus is on our own issues and what it takes to get back on track. We do not see any change to our strategic priorities and we\u2019ll aggressively seek to maximize return on our product portfolio within the confines of our business model. I will now turn the call over to Nick to provide details on Q3 and our guidance for Q4 before returning with summary comments. Nick. Nick Noviello : Thanks Tom. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. NetApp delivered strong non-GAAP gross margin and operating margin in fiscal Q3, underscoring the resiliency of our business model. We delivered non-GAAP EPS within our previous guidance range. However, as Tom indicated the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, combined with our own sales execution challenges presented headwinds in Q3 and resulted in revenue below our expectations. Net revenues of $1.55 billion were up about 1% sequentially, but down 4% year-over-year. FX headwinds reduced the year-over-year revenue comparison by about 1 and 1.5 points, only a point of which we had anticipated when we gave revenue guidance for Q3 90 days ago. Product revenue of $930 million was down 8% year-over-year. The combination of software entitlements and maintenance and service revenues totaling $622 million was up 5% year-over-year. Branded revenue was 92% of net revenues for Q3 and at $1.43 billion was flat sequentially, but down 2% year-over-year due to a combination of unfavorable foreign exchange and execution challenges in our Americas commercial sale geography. Adjusted for FX branded revenue would have been about flat year-over-year. OEM revenue which is transacted in U.S. dollars was $124 million in Q3, up 4% sequentially, but down 21% on the year-over-year basis as expected. Indirect revenue through the channels and OEMs accounted for 81% of Q3 net revenues. Arrow and Avent contributed 22% and 16% of net revenues respectively.  Non-GAAP gross margin of 64.6% was up just over 1 point from Q3 last year and just above our prior guidance range despite FX headwinds. Non-GAAP product gross margin of 57% was relatively flat year-over-year driven by unfavorable mix and FX, partially offset by continued supply chain executions. Sequentially non-GAAP product gross margin was down just over a point due to mix.  Service gross margin of 64.5% was 3.7 points above Q3 of last year and 1.8 points above Q2 due to higher services revenues and lower spending. Non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter was 18.5% at the high end of our previous guidance range. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 46% of revenue. Consistent with our expectations, our non-GAAP effective tax rate for the third quarter was 16.5%. Q3 weighted average diluted share count of 317 million shares was below our prior guidance, down 6 million shares sequentially and down 29 million shares or 8% from Q3 last year due to continued stock repurchase activity. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.75 was in line with our prior guidance range and reflects the net impact of year-over-year FX headwinds of $0.02. Our balance sheet remains healthy. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.3 billion in cash and investments, 13% of which is onshore. The sequential decrease in onshore cash was predominately due to shares repurchased and dividends paid in the quarter. Inventory turns were at 19 and day sales outstanding were 39. Deferred revenue was $3.1 billion, up 2% sequentially and up 5% year-over-year. Q3 cash from operations was $275 million and free cash flow was 16% of revenue impacted by an increase in day sales outstanding due to unfavorable linearity. In Q3 we returned $251 million to shareholders, which included $200 million in share repurchases and $51 million in cash dividends. Consistent with the guidance we provided last May, we remain on track to complete the remaining $206 million of our current share repurchase program by the end of May 2015, a year ahead of our original schedule. Over the last few years we have evolved our capital structure and delivered on our commitment to return capital to shareholders, while continuing to invest in the business. Through dividends and share repurchases we have returned a total of $3.2 billion to shareholders since May 2013. We are well positioned to move ahead with the next phase of our capital allocation strategy.  I am pleased to announce that we have increased the size of our share repurchase authorization by $2.5 billion. We intend to complete this additional $2.5 billion share repurchase program by the end of May 2018, with the first $1 billion of repurchases expected to be completed by the end of May 2016. Today we also announced our next cash dividend of $0.165 per share of the company\u2019s stock to be paid on April 23, 2015. We remain committed to increasing our dividend overtime.  Enhancement to our capital allocation strategy reflects our confidence in the long-term strength of NetApp\u2019s business as well as our ongoing commitment to increasing shareholder value. We have structured the capital allocation plan to ensure flexibility to support innovation and growth initiatives. The timing and amount of repurchased transactions under the program, as well as future dividends and dividend increases will depend on market conditions, business and financial considerations and regulatory requirements. Now to guidance, we remain confident in our strategy and competitive position. However, based on our own sales execution issues and the continued challenging IT spending environment, we are building a degree of caution into our top line expectations.  We also expect FX headwinds to continue and impact the year-over-year comparisons. As a result our target revenue range for Q4 is $1.55 billion to $1.65 billion, which at the mid-point implies 3% sequential growth and a 3% decline in revenue versus Q4 last year. Based on current rates we have embedded an FX headwind of $50 million into our Q4 revenue guidance. We expect our strong value proposition to continue to resonate with customers and we will have an ongoing focus on supply chain efficiencies. With that said, we expect non-GAAP gross margins of approximately 63% to 63.5% in Q4, including about a point of FX headwinds. We expect non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 17% to 17.5% reflecting about a point of FX headwinds, as well as investments in our go-to-market capacity. Based on our repurchases in Q3 we expect Q4 diluted share count of approximately 319 million shares down 5% versus last year. We expect non-GAAP earnings per share for Q4 to range from approximately $0.70 to $0.75 per share, which reflects about $0.05 of dilution from unfavorable foreign exchange versus last year. Our full year fiscal 2015 revenue will be lower than anticipated due to currency headwinds and incremental caution entering Q4, which I reference earlier. EPS is expected to be flat from FY \u201914 due to FX headwinds, revenue softness and investments in the business, offset by gross margin improvement and share repurchases.  In closing, our product portfolio is as strong as it\u2019s ever been and our discussions with customers continue to evolve to more strategic levels. Our capital allocations strategy continues to reflect confidence in our ability to generate significant free cash flow, which will enable us to invest both organically and inorganically in the business, as well as return significant capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.  The investments we are making today position us to fully take advantage of the opportunity ahead and we expect to emerge from this transition with greater levels of growth and profitability. Through this evolution we remain committed to our business model and to delivering shareholder value.  Now, I would like to turn the call back to Tom for summary comments. Tom. Tom Georgens : Thanks Nick. We remain confident in our business, but continue to operate in a challenging environment. We face ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties and FX headwinds. Our industry is in transition as enterprises manage their existing infrastructure to meet the current and growing demands of the business, while adopting new technologies and delivery options. Our solutions and technology vision are well suited to help customers meet both of these requirements. Cloud will play a key role in creating value for enterprise customers and we want to accelerate their ability to realize that value. Enterprise will deploy a hybrid model with both cloud based and on premise resources in their IT environments. Our NetApp data fabric vision provides customers with the only consistent way to manage, secure and protect their data regardless of where they choose to store it. The NetApp data fabric weaves together disparate data elements of the hybrid cloud into a single integrated architecture, giving customers control and choice with the flexibility, elasticity and ubiquity of cloud resources. Data ONTAP is the foundation of the NetApp data fabric. Clustered Data ONTAP delivers true software-defined functionality with a set of enterprise-wide data management capabilities independent of the underlying hardware. Clustered ONTAP enables customers to grow incrementally and non-disruptively with the flexibility of a wide range of deployment options; from converged and integrated systems to third-party arrays, as well as software only and cloud options. We are confident in our ability to help customers take advantage of the evolving IT landscape. Our data fabric vision and portfolio of data management solutions offer differentiated approach that improves the economics and flexibility of customers existing infrastructure, while giving on path to a hybrid cloud future. Our best of breed solutions are compelling for existing requirements and are integrated into a broader vision for the hybrid cloud that only NetApp can deliver. The investments we are making in our go-to-market capacity and then accelerating the migration to Clustered ONTAP demonstrate the strength of our conviction in our technology and our strategy.  During this transition we remain committed to our business model and delivering shareholder value. Our expanded repurchase authorization exemplifies this commitment. We expect to come through the transition in a stronger position with a high level of growth and profitability. Before moving to Q&A, I would like to thank the entire NetApp team for their continued commitment. Despite the challenging environment we are making the right choices and remain focused on innovation and execution, which enable us to deliver value to our customers and yield solid operational returns. We will now open up the call for Q&A. Please be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to one question, so we can address as many people as possible. Thank you. Operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open please proceed with your question. Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank : Hi, thanks. Nike I was trying to get a sense of how the FX split out between your different segments. Thank you for the detail on the impact this quarter; but was a lot of that in product or was it also in the software and services segment. It seemed like the product revenue was down a lot year-over-year? Thanks. Nick Noviello : Yes, Sherri in terms of Q3 in terms of product revenue for Q3 it was all there, so its about two point on product revenue from the FX side of the fence. You have to remember that the SEM line and the services line are substantially coming in off the balance sheet. So the FX is really pointed at the product side of fence. Sherri Scribner - Deutsche Bank : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Maynard Um with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open please proceed with your question. Maynard Um - Wells Fargo : A little bit about the execution issues. I guess to start, what gives you confidence that it is execution issues rather than competitive or secular and I guess what, can you go into the issues a little bit more in particular on how you do intent to fix that going forward? Thanks. Tom Georgens : Well, I think from the question about whether it will be secular or competitive, and effectively what we are talking about here, what we saw pushed out were actually deals in the committed pipeline. So whether the question of we didn\u2019t have pipeline and we didn\u2019t have deals that we are pursuing, these are deals that the sales force had committed, that reflected in our forecast, reflected in our guidance and reflected in our planning as the quarter proceeded, and so not surprisingly Monday the quarter ended, I was ahead of Americas sales and went through, what happened to these deals? They went through a relatively long list of deals two pages worth of deals that were committed that we expect to count that didn\u2019t come in and all of them have a story of which competitive and loss deals was a trivially small amount of that.  So from a competitive perspective I\u2019d say first and foremost the competitive wasn\u2019t the key components. Some of it clearly was closable deals that we didn\u2019t get done and that\u2019s entirely on us, some of it was changes in customer behavior with the change of the calendar year and companies looking at their own financial forecast, their own FX impact. We certainly saw the fall of deals that we thought were there. The other thing is, in order for the deals to be in the committed pipeline there are deals for which substantially we have won the technical recommendation, so the competitive phase of a lot of these transactions was effectively over. So it\u2019s really about either customers changing budgets, requiring more scrutiny in their approval process or fundamentally thinking about their new budgets in line with the new calendar year.  I think going forward clearly we need to watch this a lot more closely. We certainly saw elongated sale cycles earlier in the quarter, but the forecast has remained unchanged and the team is still relatively bullish about pulling it out. So I think that, we need to look at some of the data points along the way. Certainly we need to inspect a lot closer and you can argue that the other side of this and the message to the team is that there is uncertainty about closing deals, you need more deals, so what are we going to do to enhance the pipeline. So clearly we are going to be watching this closely as we look at our productivity, whether it be pipeline generation per rep and even despite the quarter in terms of actually bookings per rep, the numbers are actually quite high, relatively high in our history. So the sales force productivity is actually still pretty high, yet we didn\u2019t get these deals closed. But the feeling is it isn\u2019t like the sales force can\u2019t sell and productivity is down. That will be more of an indicator of a product problem or there is no opportunity out there. So our feeling is as long as productivity is high that people are generating pipeline at peak levels historically, that if we could put more feet on the street and get more people out there selling the product, we can drive some more business. So that of course has a lead-time associated with in terms of hiring and bringing it up to speed. But at the end of the day we wouldn\u2019t have these deals in the committed pipeline, we wouldn\u2019t have the pipeline productivity we had unless we felt strongly about the portfolio and the portfolio was resonating.  So I think where we are now, you know I don\u2019t think product is our issue. I think capacity is our issue and that\u2019s the bet we are making and that\u2019s what you are going to see from us going forward. Maynard Um - Wells Fargo : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Your line is now open please proceed with your question. Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal : Hi Tom. I want to follow on Maynard\u2019s question. Clearly every enterprise company is suffering from FX and so let\u2019s remove that from the conversation, but we haven\u2019t heard many or very, very few companies talk about elongated sales cycles in the current macro with the recent string a companies that have reported, including Cisco tonight.  So just wanted to try to understand what\u2019s your thoughts on why NetApp in particular seems to be seeing some issues on deferrals or pipeline not coming through. Is it something related to the storage side in particular, but just want to get some more thoughts about why you think NetApp in particular is seeing some of those elongated sales cycles. Tom Georgens : Well, I think a few things. I think some of those I\u2019ll say; I don\u2019t think we quite know. I think we need more data. All we really understand is our own point of view here. So certainly we see the FX that\u2019s a purely mathematical exercise, we get that.  Likewise we see FX not only in our industry but we also see FX impact on our customers and that\u2019s got to lead through into the decisions that they make. So I don\u2019t really know the answer to your question, until we see actually more companies that are reporting January quarters. So our assumption if FX is purely mathematically and everything else is our responsibility to get on to and fix.  And like I said, if you look at these individual accounts, there is no doubt that we had closeable deals that we didn\u2019t get done in time and that\u2019s pure execution and those will fall into Q4, but we\u2019ve also seen elongated approval cycles and we\u2019ve also seen people re-evaluating what their plans are for the year now that the calendar year has changed. People thought they had budget when we put this in the pipeline, they don\u2019t now and I think the return on those transactions is as yet unknown.  So I think from our perspective we just clearly need to do better on that. I\u2019m certainly not ready to say that there is a broader trend until I see some more data points, but for our point of view is that we are going to focus on our deals and our pipeline and we are going to do a better job executing this quarter. Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal : Tom was everything on track the first two months and the wheels kind of came off the last months for the quarter? Tom Georgens : Well certainly the forecast hadn\u2019t deteriorated materially at the beginning, so we were. Obviously this is a quarter where you\u2019ve got kind of the end of the quarter push and you got the end of the calendar year push, which is a little bit different than other quarters. But from our point of view is certainly we saw bullishness going into the end of the year and then still we have expectation of a relatively strong normal quarter end in January, and a fair amount of that business didn\u2019t come through the way we would have thought.  So I think we did see the budget flush. Maybe we can debate whether is this robust as we would have thought, but certainly close enough, but we certainly had a lot of January business that was a normal part of our final month of the quarter that we see being back end loaded that didn\u2019t come. And like I said, every deal has a story, but when you go through 40 deals and only one or two are competitive and the rest of them are deals specific, I don\u2019t think the competition is really the issue. And on top of that, the feedback from the field was optimistic the whole quarter.  We still did a record number of million or increased number of million dollar deals. So it wasn\u2019t like they were searching for business. They have business that they have, that it was winding up and they thought they were going to close and they didn\u2019t. Keith Bachman - Bank of Montreal : Okay, I will cede the floor then, thank you. Tom Georgens : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open please proceed with your question. Kulbinder Garcha - Credit Suisse : Thank you for the question. For Tom, with respect to the deferral of spending you're talking about, I guess this comes after a period of time where there's already been a prolonged period of deferral.  So I guess at some point your customers in your installed base just need to spend to much data growth, and despite all the efficiencies out there, why isn't that helping your visibility at some point? I'm just kind of curious, we've had a period of kind of sluggish growth in storage in the industry frankly, not just with your numbers. And so I'm curious as to how you would think about that dynamic going through last year and then now having this added issue?  And then the other clarification is despite this deferral of spending that you talk about, you're not really assuming any that goes back in the near term just to be clear, just to be conservative. Is that correct? Tom Georgens : Yes, I think certainly you don\u2019t and with the surprise that we had where committed deals didn\u2019t closed and that assumed they were all just going to come back that simply. I think clearly we need to derate some of the feedback that we get, and I think we need to embed some caution into this and likewise frankly I think we need to see what other companies are reporting at January close and see if this is common or not.  So I think that there is just a natural sense of conservatism, both in terms of the forecast we receive and likewise. Our own judging of those forecasts as a result of this. I mean simply put, we came out of the last quarter relatively bullish.  When I lay out the delay of the land we were pushing the cloud story, we came out of Insight with a lot of momentum, the feedback on the cloud and the hybrid cloud from customers and partners has been tremendous. We did a dramatic expansion of the portfolio with refreshes E-Series introduction of the storage with Webscale, we acquired the SteelSore product the release of 8.3.  So very strong about the portfolio. I felt very strong about the forecast and I think we came out this last call actually relatively excited about where we are heading. So that\u2019s why we are really doubly disappointed about all of this. In the end if suddenly there was a competitive disjoint or some type of quality issue or some type of product issue, but there is really none of that. So things were pretty much normal as far as we look at the quarter as it played out until we got to the end. Operator : Thank you our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. Rod Hall - JP Morgan : Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. I guess I want to circle back around this January commentary and see if you guys could \u2013 those 40 deals, I guess Tom that you are talking about, is there any regional pattern that you spotted? I mean did you see particular regions worsening in January and others not? Did you see just sort of across the board in January things not coming through as you had expected?  And then I also, just as a follow-up to that, wanted to see if you could comment. Do you think that, have you had any direct feedback from people suggesting that maybe budgets got reset and they come back to the table in January and they can't do the deal because there's some sort of a trend in terms of enterprise budgets? Thank. Tom Georgens : Yes, I mean the budget reset is exactly what I\u2019m saying. So I think that that\u2019s clearly the case. I think in terms of markets in general, certainly energy was one that kind of jumped out of people being very, very cautious obviously with the movement of the price of oil and I think certainly on the oil and gas it has a negative impact. Presumably it will help the rest of the industry, but I think that\u2019s a lot more diffused and I think it will take more time to flow through. So I\u2019d say probably the only segment that I\u2019d say that we can clearly identify with relatively urge and caution would be oil and gas, but I\u2019d say mostly the rest of the business is spread around. I mean other sectors were very robust. I mean one of the things that we talked about in prior calls is our belief that we are going to see solid growth on the federal side, the second half of the year, over easier compares last year that entirely came through.  So if I think about the road map that we went into this year, we communicated at analyst day, we talked about our rebound in federal in terms of growth in the second half of the year and we certainly saw that. We talked about focus on the enterprise and we certainly saw record $1 million deals, we certainly saw that. We saw certainly growth in $1 million deals and I think overall it seems like a number of those things were on track and that\u2019s what we kind of left last quarter with, in terms of how we felt about the second half of the year.  So I think some of the things came together and but the other ones didn\u2019t. I think we sense that FX was clearly an issue that was certainly a comment that we had last quarter. I think that\u2019s proven to be a bigger issue than we originally thought and they quantify that and likewise it\u2019s not just an issue for us or our competitors, that\u2019s also an issue for our customers, which has impact on their buying. Rod Hall - JP Morgan : Great. Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you our next question comes from the line of Steve Milunovich with UBS. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. Steve Milunovich - UBS: Thank you. Tom, did you say that there was a change in sales management? Could you talk a bit more about it? If that's true, who is in place now? And you also talked about investments in go-to-markets. Could you talk a bit about what those investments are? And Nick, are we going to see kind of a pickup in the SG&A to revenue ratio in the fourth quarter? Tom Georgens : Yes I don\u2019t think its any secret that certainly we hired a new Head of Global Sales and we also have new leadership in the Americas commercial business. I should point out that the leader of that business is the person who led our federal business to number one market share in the federal space. So it\u2019s a person that has very strong track record, somebody we have a lot of confidence in. So could it be some measure of them not being familiar with their guys and judging the forecast, I think certainly that\u2019s a factor, but I think in general these are people that were pleased with the work that Randy doing, certainly Mark\u2019s has a great history and so we are still confident in the team. So I wouldn\u2019t want to signal any of this message that there is a change in the team.  Perhaps there is some change in process, perhaps that impacted the forecasting; I\u2019m guessing that that\u2019s a factor, but we are talking about two people who practice really deep inspection. Like I said on the Monday the quarter was over, I had a very, very detailed report on what happed in the quarter before in terms of deals that happened, deals that didn\u2019t happened, why they didn\u2019t happened and what we should expect going forward. Nick Noviello : Steve, its Nick. Let me just add to that comment or answer your question around SG&A revenue. When we look at operating expenses, what Tom mentioned in his comments, this is also going to be an environment where we are going to position our investments for highest return activity. So to the degree we are investing in certain areas and pushing investments in some, we are going to be holding investment in others and I think that\u2019s really important from the perspective of the business model and running the business go forward.  So I don\u2019t see a material change in Q4 as an example of SG&A to revenue. Certainly and we\u2019ll give guidance in May for next year and we\u2019ll talk about Q1, we\u2019ll go a quarter at a time and give you a perspective a quarter at a time. Always a lot of times Q1 looks a little disjointed, why? Because top line there is a substantial sequential decline in top line from Q4 to Q1, so we\u2019ll go through all of that now. But to your specific question of Q4, I don\u2019t see a substantial or a material change in the SG&A or the operating expense to revenue ratios here. Steve Milunovich - UBS: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley : Yes, thank you. How do we reconcile the comments on the weak January and delayed deals with DSOs that were up 6 days at the end of the quarter? And then also does the limited recovery in branded growth after refreshing the product portfolio change you are thinking on acquisitions as it relates to just broadening out the product portfolio? Thanks. Tom Georgens : No I think the DSO is a function of the timing of shipments and invoicing more than anything else. While there are elongated sales cycles, we still were backend loaded even through we didn\u2019t take all this business at the end.  But that said, I don\u2019t think there is really anything more to the DOS story. The other question about \u2013 oh! Acquisitions. I think acquisitions, I don\u2019t think this changes our opinion on acquisitions. I think we will continue to move ahead with tuck-in acquisitions that expand our portfolio. We did two this past quarter. The SteelStore one is the one that got more headlines and I think we will continue to do that and that should be the normal course of business. I wouldn\u2019t expect that to neither accelerate nor decline.  I think on the question of larger deals, those tend to be very, very asynchronous and hard to predict. So I think from our point of view if I look at transactions that we\u2019ve done, E-Series branded had a very, very strong quarter, up 100% again. I look at OnCommand Insight, which is also an acquired technology. That also had a very, very good quarter. So I think the success of our acquired business has been very good.  So from my point of view I think we\u2019ll continue to do tuck-in acquisitions. In terms of larger deals, we don\u2019t get to predict when they are going to be available, when they are going to come about. But certainly our recent track record has been pretty good and for the right transactions, the right price when that\u2019s executable, we\u2019ll certainly move ahead with that. But I wouldn\u2019t want to predict any rate or any either increased desire or decreased desire to pursue those. Nick Noviello : And maybe just a comment to really take that DSO comment Katy and take it up one level with overall cash. I mean I think that cash and cash conversion as a percentage of revenue in Q3 was perhaps a little bit lighter than we typically do. However we will have a strong quarter in front of us here as well. So when I look at the overall statistics and the overall expectations in terms of cash generation this year, I don\u2019t see any change there at all. And I see us landing right inside the types of metrics we\u2019ve talked about and modeled for the three-year period of time certainly, that we talked about in our last financial analyst day. Katy Huberty - Morgan Stanley : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Kisner with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. James Kisner \u2013 Jefferies: Okay, just want to verify something, like was there any particular product lines at all that sort of saw more details slip-outs and I guess just regionally I\u2019m looking at the year-over-year rates in both Europe and Asia, they are both down a lot sequentially here on a year-over-year basis. But Asia has a tough compare. Was there any kind of regional differences in terms of the activity you are seeing. Tom Georgens : I would say, one thin to bear in mind with the year-over-year comparison of Asia and especially EMEA, you got the currency component of that. There is some currency component, you got the Canada, South American, and the U.S. number as well or the Americas number, but not that big. So I\u2019d say certainly the FX one.  There is really two questions I think in play. One of them is the relative performance and the other one is deals that we actually had in the pipeline that we are expecting to close. So I think we are looking at both of those differently.  Overall in terms of our international business, the EMEA team is dealing with FX, obviously the Russia situation, even the French situation late in the quarter were all factors and I think overall from a booking perspective they did quite well. So I\u2019m actually \u2013 well, the numbers don\u2019t show, but I\u2019m actually quite pleased with the EMEA team.  Asia Pac is not a unified region. All the different geographies perform differently, but I think overall they did pretty well. We saw growth in China again. Certainly the China headlights haven\u2019t been great, but I think the team there continues to make progress and so I think the biggest surprise relative to where we thought we were going be is in the American and particularly the America is non-federal. James Kisner \u2013 Jefferies: Any particular product lines to follow up that under performed or had more slip outs I should say. Tom Georgens : Not in terms of slip deals. I think that the category on slip deals is really a function of size rather than product. James Kisner \u2013 Jefferies: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets : Thanks. Tom I guess this is a question for you. You talked a fair bit about I think adding more boots to the ground, adding more product specialists. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense, I mean how much headcount increase do you anticipate doing or what\u2019s the timeline to doing that? Is it one quarter or two or three quarters and what sort of payback do you expect in terms of \u2013 in my head I guess branded growth accelerating. Maybe just walk through you know what kind of headcount additions you want to do and how do you think that pans out on the other side in terms of branded growth? Tom Georgens : Well, I think at this point we are not ready to quantify that. I think that\u2019s a model that we are working through on our own. But obviously it will be something that we think is going to move the needle and something that we want to move the needle this coming fiscal year. So its not that its going to move the needle in the immediate term. I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re going to hire people and they are going to be all still coordinated in a very, very short period of time. There will be a sliding scale in terms of how they ultimately ramp up.  So the real impact to that will probably be towards the middle or the end of next year, but the vessel will be front ended and as Nick indicated, as we think about our full year business model, its our full attention to operate within the bounds of the business model that we have previously communicated. But if I look at it, it\u2019s independent of the individual issues of the end of last quarter. If I look at our ratios and I look at our investments, we\u2019ve done a substantial expansion of the portfolio. Within that portfolio has been carve outs for specialists to drive things like E-Series and OnCommand. I think that\u2019s paid off quite nicely for us.  As we think about adding new products to the portfolio whether it be StorageGRID or SteelStore, we\u2019re going to have to do some of that. So I expect all of those investments to come in, while in the meantime we still need to be cultivating new accounts and new opportunities for Clustered ONTAP. And the other one is I think that our partners are a key part of this. I think invested in the partners so they come up to speed on the new products, so they are pitching. Its accepting and successfully be self sufficient in pursuing these opportunities and likewise helping our customers with the migration to Clustered ONTAP as they are all go to market activities that I think have immediate impact or relatively near term impact on the business. But the simple fact of the matter is if sales force productivity was the issue and they were not anywhere near quota and they were sub-optimal, because we didn\u2019t have competitive products and we didn\u2019t have competitive technology, then I think we make it an entirely different investment choice. But the feeling is that the portfolio is strong and we just don\u2019t have enough people out there promoting and selling it and serving customers and that\u2019s the investment that we want to make within the confines of the business model that we talked about. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. Jim Suva - Citigroup: Hey, thanks very much. Its Jim Suva here from Citi. NetApp has been going through a little bit of shifting with its sales people you know over the past 12 to 24 months out of certain areas in the focus of other areas and then today on the conference call you mentioned a need to really get the kind of feet going and the right people at the right place, but you have the expense area to be within the relatively normal of what you expect. So can you help me explain what\u2019s different? Meaning, you\u2019ve kind of been shifting around a little bit in the past 12 to 24 months and you\u2019re saying your still looking around. So what\u2019s different and how should we think about what your truly doing different to adjust these needs, especially if the expenses are not going higher. Tom Georgens : Well, I think that there is really two questions here. One of them is the shifting of the resources within an envelope and the other one is the total envelope. So I think clearly we\u2019ve been doing shifting of resources within the envelope. I think across the entire company we worked very hard at that and I think that manifests itself in terms of the engineering choice that we made and the products that we\u2019re bringing to market. We were able to do that by de-emphasizing other products and fast moving out of certain spaces.  We have certainly seen it in terms of carving out part of the sales resource to focus on some of these newer products. I talked about E-Series and OnCommand and that has worked out well for us and I also talked \u2013 in fact we spoke at the Analyst Day around the enterprise strategy and getting our partners more self sufficient in the mid-sized business, so we can migrate some of our resources against the bigger opportunities in the enterprise and we\u2019ve seen that million dollar deals.  So if we look at that data and that is more specialists around the new products generate sales. If we look at moving more resource towards the enterprise we\u2019d generate more million dollar deals. If we can continue to make our partner self sufficient and continue that and widen the total number of people engaged in that, I think we\u2019re hard pressed off to conclude that there is an opportunity for growth in that and that\u2019s the nob that we want to turn.  So only Clustered ONTAP has been a big investment. 8.3 is a culminating release for that. We absolutely needed to get that done. We need to get customers migrated to it. We certainly have the finished investments that we\u2019re making and other key technologies around all-flash FAS and flash in general, but I think we are ready to shift that transition towards field going activities now that the product arsenal is ready. Nick Noviello : And Jim, I guess I might just add in the context of it and operating expense envelop of just under $3 billion on an annual basis, we believe we have the opportunity to shift investment for highest return activities. Jim Suva - Citigroup: All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Srini Nandury with W.R. Hambrecht and Summit Research. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. Srini Nandury - W.R. Hambrecht and Summit Research : All right, thank you for taking my call up. The question I have is that regarding your flash, FlashRay. I don\u2019t know whether you commented on FlashRay during the quarter. I must have missed my earlier part of the call. The question is that you have a single controller device and its limiting your adoption in the market. As you look at the FlashRay opportunity out there, what does it take NetApp to become a dominant FlashRay provider; perhaps second in the market at 20% to 25%. Tom Georgens : Well, you are just talking about one product in the portfolio. We actually have the EF product which is doing quite well, we\u2019ve got the FlashRay product and we also have the all-flash FAS and then we\u2019ve got the hybrid rays that also have flash. We certainly talked at the analyst day and our view of this is that flash is a compelling technology. Its got a compelling set of deployments and they are all different form factors. There is flash in the host, there is all-flash arrays, there is hybrid arrays and all those are going to be important. The key component for us ultimately is not any of the individual products or any of the individual categories. Its about total flash under management which was up huge year-over-year. So from our perspective I think we\u2019re absolutely in the flash game. I think FlashRay has been a key driver of innovation for us. We\u2019ve seen not only FlashRay in its own incarnation, but FlashRay technology integrated and introduced in the form of all-flash FAS and in EF as well, but all-flash FAS clearly has a product that the team is familiar with. It actually had a very, very big growth quarter and overall I think that the idea of an all-flash FAS instead of a stand along point product, to actually be a node of a cluster that\u2019s compatible with all of our other data movers and all of our storage efficiency and all of our scale-on capability is a compelling value proposition. So I think FlashRay is going to serve a segment of the market. We continue to invest it in some customers\u2019 hands and we\u2019re getting feedback around the key efficiency and performance and ease of use components, but that\u2019s not the totality of the flash portfolio. In fact the overall majority of our flash is in the other products and in fact the all-flash FAS, which was only introduced about a quarter and a half ago is actually the one that\u2019s actually ramping the hardest of all of those and we\u2019re actually pretty pleased with the use cases and what you\u2019ll see from that is in fact from a number of our products are compelling performance benchmarks that we\u2019re going to publish in the very, very near future. So I think from a performance perspective certainly all-flash FAS has a feature set far beyond any other flash array and compelling performance and compelling efficiency. I think you\u2019ll see a lot more of that product in the near future as well while we continue to evolve and develop FlashRay to serve the segments that its targeted at. Srini Nandury - W.R. Hambrecht and Summit Research : All right, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Wittine with Longbow Research. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. Joe Wittine - Longbow Research : Hi, thanks. On the headcount your adding, I think your saying you need more product specialists. So what exactly are you referring to? Is it more resources for the ramping flash business or maybe the service provider business or certain market verticals. I think just a little bit more clarity would be helpful. Thanks. Tom Georgens : Yes, I don\u2019t want to leave a misperception there. I think first and foremost we\u2019re adding people that are carrying numbers. Whose job it is to close business and bring business in. So product specialists, I talked about them in the category of the product specialists have been successful, but within the fixed size envelop they\u2019ve comes at the expense of generalists that are selling the standard product and pursuing new accounts and those types of things. I think we want to be able to do both of these at the same time.  So I think we have invested in an overlay. I\u2019d say the increment from here will not be nearly as significant percentage wise. What we\u2019re really looking to do is getting more people out there, getting in front of new customers, new customer acquisitions and deeper into our largest biggest customers.  So I say that, the reason why I brought the product specialty is within a fixed envelope the more product specialists you have, the less generalists you have and our new is that we need more generalists out there pushing the ONTAP based products pursuant to our enterprise strategy. We are proving that we can get big deals if we move in that direction and now we want to get more people out there cultivating new accounts, deeper in existing accounts and bringing in more big deals. Joe Wittine - Longbow Research : Helpful thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. Your line is now open please proceed with your question. Nehal Chokshi - Maxim Group : Thank you. The large deals that have been pushed out in favor of extending service agreements, is there any correlation to cloud ONTAP having become generally available? Is this potentially creating any further evaluation? Do you expect this to become a material part of these large deals? And can you give any metrics around cloud ONTAP at this point in time as well? Tom Georgens : Well, I don\u2019t think that cloud ONTAP is changing that. I don\u2019t think cloud ONTAP is the substitute necessarily for the types of systems that we are selling with Clustered ONTAP on-premise. I think cloud ONTAP is completion of a story, its an option for a tested development and backup and flexibility and DR, but I don\u2019t think its changing the dynamic of do I buy an on-premise system of do I buy that.  Now there\u2019s actually been a fair amount of activity around cloud ONTAP. The numbers of hours is in the 40,000 range. So those are people kicking the tires playing with it, some people are actually using it in production. But really when I see cloud ONTAP it\u2019s a completion of our end-to-end seamless data management story with the cloud. So I can run cloud ONTAP on extreme, I can run on-premise, then our private storage which has actually seen a lot of acceleration, its actually one of my favorite use cases. But overall I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s really disrupting it. I think the cloud ONTAP is basically at this point its symbolic, and emblematic of NetApp's end to end seamless cloud strategy and proving that its real. But I don\u2019t think its intercepting near term business, that\u2019s actually not a concern of mine. Nehal Chokshi - Maxim Group : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Benjamin Reitzes with Barclays Capital. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question. Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital : Yes, thank you for taking the question. My questions are on gross margin. What is the implied FX hit sequentially to the gross margin versus the pricing hit and mix? And to that end, do you feel you got to get more price aggressive is sort of the premise of the question as well, and versus some of the upstart competition? Thanks. Nick Noviello : Ben if your talking about Q4 gross margin guidance there is about a point of FX in there, so I think you need to consider that. I wouldn\u2019t suggest that in there is any additional pricing aggressiveness. I think that pricing has been, has really been at this rate for some time, right. So there is dynamics in pricing and from time to time we did deeply discount.  There are all of those types of things that we manage as part of managing the business. So there is not an incremental built into out gross margin guidance. We also inside our structure, inside our cog structure drive a set of efficiencies. And frankly over the last several years has been driving an increasing set of efficiencies. So I think all of that levels out in the end and I think the think to remember is there is appoint of FX in that year over year impact of that FX in that Q4 guidance. Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital : What's the sequential impact of FX? Nick Noviello : I can\u2019t have that off the top of my head here Ben. Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital : Okay, hey, thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you and our final question comes from the line of Mark Heller with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question. Mark Heller - D.A. Davidson & Co. : All right. Most of my questions have been asked by now. But let me just ask about SteelStore. Where does that fit into your expectations going forward, particularly on the cost side, but also on the top line for the next few quarters? Tom Georgens : Yes, I think what SteelStore effectively is, is a backup appliance that\u2019s integrated with the cloud and clearly from our point of view and for those of you who had insight at certainly the analyst day we talked about the economics of the cloud and cloud being a resting place for very low utilization data like backup and archive. So it\u2019s a way to seamlessly extend traditional backup all the way to the cloud and its something that we felt very, very strongly about as an opportunity and that was really the motivation for pursuing SteelStore. So I\u2019d say that post transaction I think a couple of things came out, one of which was \u2013 this is a product with a fair amount of visibility within Amazon and the Amazon relationship is developing quite nicely around cloud ONTAP around NetApp private storage and this one has become a third leg of the stool in that relationship. In fact they\u2019ve actually gave us some reference accounts to pursue with this.  So I think at this point its not material to the number that Nick just gave. It will be certainly not 05. Its already been on zero. I think its ahead of our initial forecast, but certainly we\u2019re on the very, very front end of that curve.  So I think so far so good, no regrets, but I think it\u2019s a little bit too early to tell. But the real goal there ultimately is how do we enable the next generation of back up that successfully integrates the cloud, but is compatible with all the back up methodologies that people currently deploy on premise. Mark Heller - D.A. Davidson & Co. : Okay. Thanks. Tom Georgens : Okay. So first of all, thank you all for joining us today. As I think about the quarter that we just completed and I think about where we were last quarter, the evolution of the roadmap, we introduced more new technology in the last six months, whether it be a Clustered ONTAP, 8.3, the acquisition of SteelStore, StorageGRID, OnCommand, Insight, E-Series, FlashRay or Flash FAS and the momentum that we saw, both in terms of last quarter, the forecast for this quarter, I think we feel very, very good about the business. So as I talked in the prepared text, clearly disappointed with the set back that we had. Probably a little bit more than disappointed, probably I\u2019m downright angry, because I felt like we\u2019re in very, very good shape and we need to do better than that. So as I think when we go forward I think my belief in its as good a shape as we are with the portfolio is unshaken. The execution issues we will fix and we are going to make key investments within the bounds of our business model to fully exploit the full potential of this portfolio and drive growth for this company and that\u2019s our commitment. So once again, thank you for your time and I\u2019ll see you all next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Have a great day everyone.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we'll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. And as a reminder, this conference call may be recorded. At this time, I would like to hand the conference over to Kris Newton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin. Kris Newton - Vice President- Investor Relations : Hello, and thank you for joining us on our Q4 fiscal year 2015 earnings call. With me today are CEO, Tom Georgens; and CFO, Nick Noviello. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com along with the earnings release, our financial tables and guidance, a historical supplemental data table and the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation. As a reminder, during today's call we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects such as our guidance for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2016, our expectations regarding areas for investment, expectations regarding market acceptance of clustered Data ONTAP, our ability to drive growth and operational and financial performance, our expectations for our evolving business transition and our expectations regarding our business model and FY 2016, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. Such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and are being made as of today. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons. We describe some of these reasons in our accompanying press release, which we have furnished to the SEC on a Form 8-K. Please refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, specifically our Form 10-K for fiscal year 2014, subsequent Form 10-Q quarterly reports and our current reports on Form 8-K, all of which can be found on our website. During the call we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in today's press release and on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Tom for his commentary on the quarter. Thomas Georgens - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you, Kris, and thank you all for joining us. We are not pleased with our results in the fourth quarter, and on today's call, I will outline the key reasons for our disappointing performance as well as the steps we are taking to position NetApp for the next phase of our evolution. I will then turn the call over to Nick to provide additional detail on the quarter and our expectations going into fiscal year 2016. Before we open the call for questions, I will return to summarize the reasons for our continued confidence in the business. As I've discussed on past calls, the IT industry is undergoing a radical shift as customers rebalance their IT investments to take advantage of the cloud. IT organizations will deploy a mix of on-premises and cloud-based resources, which has slowed the growth rate of the storage market. Every IT vendor is faced with this transition and the successful ones will involve their business to incorporate this new reality. We are well positioned for the era of cloud computing and with a robust portfolio of hybrid cloud solutions that enable customers to meet the current and growing demands of their business, while adopting new technologies and delivery options. NetApp itself is also undergoing a significant transition with the conversion of our customers to clustered Data ONTAP. On our last call, we talked about the execution challenges in our Americas commercial business that materialized late in the third quarter. We also discussed the need to increase our go-to-market capacity. After a thorough analysis of these challenges, it is clear that we underestimated the disruption that the transition to clustered ONTAP has had on our direct and indirect pipeline. The disruption has been most acutely felt in our Americas commercial geography due to the heavy concentration of large enterprise customers in the U.S. Clustered ONTAP is a re-architected and modernized version of the ONTAP technology. It is our platform for the next decade of innovation. However, to fully realize the benefits of this technology, customers have to update existing storage management processes and migrate their data. While the value of clustered ONTAP is driving momentum with new customers and new workloads in existing customers, many of our largest installed base customers have been resistant to upgrades until feature parity with the traditional version of ONTAP was achieved. This is even true in cases where customers have standardized on clustered ONTAP for new workloads elsewhere in their environment. The inhibitors to upgrade have now been mitigated with the generally available release of clustered ONTAP 8.3. Our largest customers now see a path to the advanced innovation and functionality of clustered ONTAP and are planning for migration. Since most of the upgrades occur in conjunction with hardware refreshes, we have seen delays in new hardware purchases until planning for process changes and downtime windows can be completed. This planning can be complex and as a consequence, customers are deferring hardware refreshes and extending the life of existing gear. The financial impact to us is lower product sales and increased short-term service renewals. The complexity and duration of clustered ONTAP transitions have implications on several dimensions. First, it reduces predictability in some of our largest accounts. We saw that in Q3 and it continued in Q4. Second, our smaller accounts, which are often partner led, are similarly facing this transition. While the installations tend to be less complex, we are often dependent upon our channel partners to guide them through the process. Those partners that have made an investment in clustered ONTAP training, typically our largest, have had a good year. However, others who are not as well versed in selling clustered ONTAP have seen their customers defer upgrades, which has negatively impacted our channel business. And third, the effort to drive this conversion has adversely impacted our ability to acquire new footprints and new customers. The net impact of these dynamics has resulted in an insufficient pipeline to meet our bookings objectives. To drive pipeline expansion we are taking concrete actions. First and foremost, we must accelerate the adoption of clustered ONTAP within our installed base now that the feature inhibitors have been removed. This requires an investment in training and migration services. The objective is to unlock the tech refreshes that are waiting for clustered ONTAP upgrades. Some of these upgrades at our largest installations are complex and will be driven through direct engagement. But others are far simpler and can be facilitated by our channel partners. Therefore, our second action is to invest in the training and assistance necessary to build the confidence and competence in our broad partner base. And finally, to offset the diversion of field focus in addressing these issues, we need to be actively engaged in acquiring new customers and new footprints through both direct and indirect channels and we will continue to invest in our sales capacity to create additional bandwidth. Overall, we remain confident in the value proposition of clustered ONTAP and our customers' commitment to the transition. Certainly, we see some customer consideration of alternative cloud-based models, but we do not see as much risk from on-premise alternatives. It is unlikely that customers will adopt competitive technologies that have fewer features and require even more complex migrations when compared to clustered ONTAP. Therefore, we are confident that our investment in accelerating clustered ONTAP migrations will unlock business. Likewise, the need to broaden our reach to address more customers through sales capacity expansion, both direct and indirect, is an investment that we expect to yield positive results. While our once-in-a-generation re-architecting of ONTAP has created a complexity for our sales channels that we are addressing, the rest of the portfolio has shown excellent progress. Looking ahead to the next generation of IT, we see the cloud as the biggest transitional force in the industry and for many use cases, it provides flexibility, economics and functionality that cannot be achieved with on-premises solutions. We are focused on accelerating enterprise ability to realize the full potential of the cloud, while recognizing that they will deploy a hybrid model with both cloud-based and on-premises resources in their IT environments. Our strategy for the hybrid cloud and our portfolio of solutions provides customers with the only consistent way to manage, secure, and protect their data regardless of where they choose to store it. NetApp hybrid cloud solutions weave together disparate data elements into a single integrated architecture, giving customers control and choice with the flexibility, elasticity and ubiquity of cloud resources. The customer feedback on our hybrid cloud strategy has been outstanding. It's viewed as relevant, compelling, differentiated and real. Even for customers who are not ready to go mainstream on the cloud components, the completeness of our story and the enablement of their future direction are proving to be reasons to buy NetApp solutions today. NetApp private storage for cloud gives customers the flexibility and economic benefits of a multi-cloud solution without the risk and regulatory concerns associated with relinquishing data stewardship or the threat of cloud vendor lock-in. During the fourth quarter, we further augmented our cloud solutions with new models of SteelStore as an Amazon machine image, giving customers an efficient and secure approach to backing up cloud-based workloads. Additionally, for customers who want a scalable, durable object storage solution for long-term archives, we have delivered on a major new release of StorageGRID Webscale which adds support for industry-leading storage efficiency, support for Amazon S3 as an integrated object storage tier and introduced the StorageGRID 5660 appliance. We also released updates to OnCommand Cloud Manager and Cloud ONTAP, giving customers new capabilities to speed business innovation and IT responsiveness. We offer enterprises a choice of cloud providers and the ability to select based on cost, performance and service levels. Our cloud solutions demonstrate our commitment to enable customers to fully realize the flexibility and economics of hyperscale clouds and to do so as a seamless extension of their on-premise environment. Other new elements of our portfolio have shown excellent progress this past year. Almost half of our enterprise customers are buying multiple solutions from our portfolio, proving that we are much broader than just ONTAP. Unit shipments of branded E-Series, inclusive of the all-flash EF family grew by 45% from Q4 a year ago and more than doubled in fiscal year 2015. E-Series augments our storage offerings with a high-performance SAN array for environments that do not require the level of data management provided by clustered ONTAP. Additionally, OnCommand Insight, in use at the largest companies in the world, continues to exhibit strong growth with orders in the fourth quarter nearly doubling from a year ago. OnCommand Insight allows IT organizations to monitor their heterogeneous storage infrastructure and optimize asset utilization, which is critical as they manage through constrained spending environments. Much of the acceleration of the growth of these products in fiscal year 2015 resulted from bringing product specialists into a single organization focused on bringing new products to market. We recently added our hybrid cloud products to this organization, and it will continue to be one of the areas of increased investment. We are excited by the increasing thought leadership of our cloud offerings and the sales momentum of the newer products, but it has been more than offset by the slowdown in the aggregate ONTAP business. New investments in traditional ONTAP deployments have been declining with unit shipments down 30% in fiscal year 2015. But the story of those customers who have made the transition to clustered ONTAP is a cause for optimism. Clustered ONTAP delivers a software-defined, flash-optimized, cloud-enabled operating environment with a set of enterprise-wide data management capabilities independent of the underlying hardware. Customers can grow incrementally and non-disruptively with the flexibility of a wide range of deployment options from conversion-integrated systems to third-party arrays as well as software-only and cloud options. We see a growing number of clustered ONTAP customers up 135% in fiscal year 2015 from the prior year. The bulk of this growth came from new to NetApp customers, which were up roughly 250% in fiscal year 2015. The number of repeat clustered ONTAP customers was also robust, growing more than 140% in the year. Additionally, shipments of clustered nodes grew 138% from Q4 a year ago and for the full year, they grew 163%. The attach rate of clustered ONTAP continues to increase with roughly 50% of FAS controllers shipped in the fourth quarter going into clustered environments. Once transition to clustered ONTAP we see customer growth above current industry growth rates. Clustered ONTAP is also a vehicle for our leadership in key emerging segments of the storage industry. In converged infrastructure, FlexPod had another good year with unit shipments up almost 20% this year. More than 70% of our FlexPod systems are shipped with clustered ONTAP. All-flash FAS with clustered ONTAP is the only unified scale-out all-flash array on the market and gives customers the ability to deploy a high-performance node in their storage pool without having to make compromises. The clustered ONTAP-based all-flash arrays have demonstrated the ability to match the performance and efficiency claims of the point product all-flash solutions, while uniquely delivering the scalability of clustering and the industry-leading data management of ONTAP. Rather than creating yet another island of infrastructure, NetApp seamlessly integrates flash into our data management framework that not only extends to discs but to the cloud as well. Shipments of all-flash FAS grew significantly at more than 350% from Q4 a year ago and for the full year, they grew 260%. In the fourth quarter, 72% of all-flash FAS arrays shipped as clustered configurations. Ultimately, we remain confident in the innovative value proposition that clustered ONTAP offers IT organizations as they build out their hybrid cloud environments. Customers and partners who have made the transition to clustered ONTAP are growing and this underpins our confidence that now is the time to position investments towards our three priorities of accelerating the migration to clustered ONTAP, regaining traction in the channel, and increasing our sales capacity. I'll now turn the call over to Nick to provide details on the fourth quarter and our expectations for the first quarter and fiscal year 2016. Nick? Nicholas R. Noviello - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Operations: Thank you, Tom. Good afternoon, everyone. We are disappointed that our performance in the fourth quarter fell outside of our previous guidance ranges. As Tom discussed, we are experiencing not only a market transition but a transition related to clustered ONTAP. We achieved our financial targets in the first half of fiscal year 2015, but in the second half a combination of FX headwinds and weakness in our Americas commercial geography negatively impacted results. While we are confident in our strategy and technology, we need to retool aspects of our business to position NetApp for long-term growth and strong sustainable shareholder returns. We expect that there will be disruption related to this transition in retooling during the first half of fiscal year 2016 but that by the second half we will return to a growth trajectory and to our business model. I will talk through this further after I review Q4 and fiscal year 2015 results. Net revenues for Q4 were $1.54 billion, down about 1% sequentially and down about 7% year-over-year. Our results fell short of our previous guidance range due to the impact of continued weakness in our Americas commercial sales geography and unfavorable foreign exchange rates. FX headwinds reduced sequential growth in Q4 by about two points and year-over-year growth by about three points. For fiscal year 2015, net revenues were $6.12 billion, down 3% from fiscal year 2014, reflecting about a point of foreign exchange headwind. Our revenues were on plan in the first half of the fiscal year, but lower-than-expected branded revenue negatively impacted the second half. Branded revenue was 93% of net revenues in Q4 and at $1.44 billion was up 1% sequentially and down 7% year over year. The year-over-year decline reflects four points of foreign exchange impact with the remainder due to weakness in our Americas commercial geography. OEM revenue of $102 million was down 18% sequentially and down 7% year over year, in line with expectation. For the year, branded revenue was $5.6 billion, down 2% from fiscal year 2014 and flat when adjusted for FX, again reflecting weakness in our Americas commercial geography. OEM revenue was $473 million, down 19% from last year, as expected. OEM revenue ended the year at less than 10% of fiscal year net revenues and has normalized to a level of revenue that we will no longer be discussing separately. Indirect revenue through the channels and OEMs declined to 79% of Q4 net revenues compared to 81% in Q3 and 83% in Q4 last year. From a geographic perspective, all geos performed as or better than expected in Q4 when adjusted for FX with the exception of Americas commercial. Americas' commercial revenue declined 8% year over year, primarily driven by the challenges Tom talked about associated with our clustered ONTAP transition and sales coverage. Product revenue was $913 million in the fourth quarter, down 2% sequentially and 12% year over year. Adjusted for FX, product revenue was down 8% year over year. Over the course of fiscal year 2015, including in the fourth quarter, we saw an increase in the number of short-term support renewals. We believe these renewals would show up on the balance sheet largely in short-term deferred revenue are an indication that customers remain committed to NetApp, but are not yet ready to do a tech refresh and to upgrade to clustered ONTAP. The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenues totaling $626 million in the fourth quarter was up 3% year over year or 5% adjusted for FX. Non-GAAP gross margin of 62% was down 2.6 points from Q3 and below our prior guidance range. Product gross margin of 53.4% was down 5 points year over year due to FX headwinds, higher discounting, and unfavorable product mix. Software maintenance gross margin was down almost a point year over year but flat to Q3. Hardware maintenance and other services gross margin of 62.6% was relatively flat year over year, reflecting increased revenue offset by infrastructure investments in people and projects. For fiscal year 2015, gross margin of 64% was almost a point above fiscal year 2014 and at the high end of our previous guidance range. Non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter was 15.6%, below our previous guidance range due to lower revenue and gross margins. We held operating expense dollars flat from Q4 a year ago, aided in part by favorable foreign exchange. However, operating expenses rose as a percentage of revenue, as we were not able to reduce costs in the business at the same pace as the revenue declined. Operating margin for the full year was down just over a point from fiscal year 2014 and a point below our previous guidance. Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $0.65 was below our prior guidance range due to lower revenue and lower gross margin. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was 16.5% for fiscal year 2015 and 16.7% for the fourth quarter, slightly higher than prior guidance reflecting normal course year-end true-ups. Q4 weighted average diluted share count of 313 million shares decreased by almost 4 million shares from Q3 due to repurchase activity in the quarter. Over the course of the year, we reduced weighted average fully diluted share count by 8% to 321 million shares. Now, turning to cash and balance sheet metrics. We closed fiscal 2015 with just over $5.3 billion in cash and short-term investments, approximately 11% of which is on shore. Inventory turns decreased to 16 due to a buildup of finished goods to support a higher anticipated level of demand than was recognized. Days sales outstanding increased to 46, reflecting typical seasonality. Deferred revenue was up $88 million in Q4 versus Q3 and up $97 million from Q4 last year. Free cash flow of $359 million was about 23% of net revenue in the fourth quarter. Over the course of the year, we generated $1.1 billion in free cash flow, marking the fifth consecutive year of strong performance. At approximately 18% of revenue, fiscal year 2015 free cash flow was within our previous guidance range. Finally, we repurchased approximately $246 million of stock and paid $51 million in cash dividends during the quarter. We completed the $3 billion share repurchase program we announced in May 2013 a year ahead of our original schedule. We also commenced purchasing stock related to the $2.5 billion share repurchase program we announced last quarter. As you may recall, our board of directors authorized $2.5 billion of repurchases by the end of May 2018 with the first $1 billion of repurchases expected to be completed by the end of May 2016. We have enhanced our capital structure, and during the year once again delivered on our commitment to return capital to shareholders while continuing to invest in the business. Through dividends and share repurchases, we have returned approximately $3.5 billion to shareholders since May 2013. Today, we announced an increase of 9% to our next cash dividend to $0.18 per share of the company's stock that will be paid on July 23, 2015. We have now increased the dividend 20% since announcing the program in May 2013. At current stock prices, the new dividend rate represents a yield of approximately 2%, which reflects our confidence in the long-term strength of the underlying business and our ongoing commitment to driving shareholder value. Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our business outlook and guidance. We remain confident in our business over the long-term. However, consistent with Tom's comments, we are in a period of transition and consequently expect some impact while we retool the business for the future. The disruption related to this transition will impact the first half of fiscal year 2016, but by the second half, we expect to return to a growth trajectory and to our business model. Related to this transition, we are focused on balancing disciplined investments with profitability to drive our business priorities and ultimately generate value for shareholders. With respect to our expense structure, we are intent on returning to a level of operating expenses commensurate with our operating model. We are committed to looking for efficiency, taking cost out of our structure and to redirecting resources and people to highest return activities. We recently executed a set of decisions across our cost structure that will generate savings in fiscal year 2016, including a reduction of our global workforce by approximately 4%. For fiscal 2016, we expect net revenues to be no better than flat with FX headwinds and limited top-line predictability in the first half and an overall recovery and revenue growth in the second half. Though ultimately dependent on revenue mix, growth and our continued actions to drive down costs, we expect fiscal 2016 gross margin as a percentage of revenue to be down about one point from fiscal 2015, ultimately related to the clustered ONTAP transition. We expect operating margin as a percentage of revenue to be down one point to two points for the year but to return to our 18% to 20% target operating margin range by the second half. We expect a year of continued strong cash flow generation as well as deferred revenue growth. Finally, we expect to continue to repurchase our stock and based on the current prices, reduce share count by another 5%. This equates to a return of over 100% of free cash flow to shareholders again in fiscal 2016. We expect our Q1 net revenues to range between $1.275 billion and $1.375 billion, which at the midpoint implies a sequential decline of approximately 14% and an 11% decrease year over year. This is despite a 14-week quarter in Q1, an event that occurs every six years. As we begin the year, we expect to continue to be negatively impacted by FX as well as disruption related to the transition to clustered ONTAP and a one-time increase in lead times due to a factory move. We expect Q1 consolidated non-GAAP gross margins of approximately 63% to 63.5% and operating expense before the 14th week to be approximately flat to Q4. That said, given the decline in net revenues and gross margins and the increase of operating expenses, we expect Q1 non-GAAP operating margins of approximately 6% to 7%. Based on our stock repurchases in Q4 and in the first 10 days of Q1, we expect our diluted share count for the quarter to be approximately 315 million shares and non-GAAP earnings per share for Q1 to range from approximately $0.20 to $0.25 per share. In closing, NetApp is uniquely positioned to help customers as they navigate the transformation of their IT deployments by providing a bridge from the choices of today to their requirements for the future. We are firmly convinced that the investments we are making today will position NetApp for long-term success and enable us to quickly return to our operating model. Finally, our capital allocation strategy continues to reflect confidence in our ability to generate significant free cash flow, which will enable us to invest both organically and inorganically in the business as well as continue to return significant capital to our shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Now, I would like to turn the call back to Tom for summary comments. Tom? Thomas Georgens - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thanks, Nick. NetApp is in the midst of two transitions, one faced by all IT vendors, the shift to the cloud; and one that is NetApp-specific, the transition from legacy ONTAP to clustered ONTAP. We are confident in our ability to navigate these transitions, but expect some amount of turbulence over the course of fiscal year 2016. Our disappointing top-line growth in the second half of fiscal year 2015 has likely resulted in some market share loss, but we are confident in our ability to gain share going forward. Our best-of-breed solutions compete effectively against point products and are integrated to a broader vision for the hybrid cloud that only NetApp can deliver. Our portfolio of data management solutions offers a differentiated approach that enables customers to solve today's problems with a technology set that provides a path to the future, improving their ability to navigate through the evolving IT landscape. Clustered ONTAP is the foundation of a data fabric vision, providing customers efficient and consistent data management that spans the hybrid cloud and unifies isolated data resources. OnCommand Insight, FlexArray, and Cloud ONTAP help drive our value proposition outside of our installed base. Our flash solutions deliver industry-leading performance coupled with enterprise hardened software. NetApp private storage for cloud, SteelStore and StorageGRID Webscale offer customers a secure way to leverage the resources of the hyperscale cloud providers. We have three clear priorities for investments : accelerating the migration to clustered ONTAP, regaining traction in the channel and increasing our sales capacity. Our strength of conviction in the benefits of those investments comes from the fact that customers and partners that have moved to clustered ONTAP are growing. It is our imperative to transition more customers and partners to clustered ONTAP. We believe that these investments will drive long-term revenue growth, although that growth will be somewhat muted and will ramp over time as we work through our transition and shift to the hybrid cloud. We expect the investments we are making today will be catalysts for growth and drive improvements in the second half of the year, putting us back on our operating model in the second half of fiscal year 2016 and with momentum going into fiscal year 2017. Before closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for their dedication and focus on execution as we work through this transition. At this point, we will open up the call for Q&A. As always, I ask that you be respectful of your peers on the call and limit yourself to one question so we can address as many as possible. Thank you. Operator? Operator : Thank you. The first question comes from the Kulbinder Garcha from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. I have a (33:42) simple question and a follow-up. Tom, a question for you on the transition on clustered ONTAP. I'm just \u2013 I was looking at the last transcript and on there you talked about ONTAP meeting the technical requirements of your largest customers and most demanding customers. But it sounds like it was kind of a release and it didn't? What I'm trying to (34:02) understand what exactly (34:03) what you thought the last three months ago to actually now in terms of this actual release and how the customer feedback has gone? What exactly went wrong and what's causing this transition, frankly? And then just for Nick, I understand the operating margin decline that you spoke about. I think you said down to about 6% to 7% in the first quarter. What's the gross margin direction? I assume it's going down. I'm trying to (34:27) understand how much is negative OpEx average (34:28) versus gross margin. Thanks. Thomas Georgens - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I think \u2013 first of all on clustered ONTAP, as we went into the year and even as the year progressed is we got off to a pretty good start and we were ahead of our internal plan at the halfway point and it seems like things were picking up. And we felt on prior calls like this, we talked about where the optimism in the second half and we certainly knew that we were going to get easier compares on the U.S. public sector and we certainly saw that come to fruition. And the other side is the breadth of the product portfolio. We had a lot of new products in the portfolio, whether it be E-Series or StorageGRID or OnCommand Insight and that. And the other key thing was that we had the release of 8.3 coming, 8.3 of clustered ONTAP. And it was my full intention that that was going to be a big growth stimulant for us. In terms of feature gaps relative to prior releases and 7-Mode, in terms of customer inhibitors, those have been substantially closed, in fact, almost entirely closed. The really key one on this one was really around high availability for our most complicated workloads. And not only closing features, so it's not like we just caught up to where we used to be. We've got a lot of compelling functionality here that doesn't exist at any other \u2013 in any of our raw (35:49) products or any of our competitors' products. Also built in this was a set of tools to help with the transition. We had \u2013 around the FAS2000 family, we had efficiency capabilities to make clustered ONTAP the natural target for the FAS2000 as well. And we had a lot of performance enhancements particularly around all-flash FAS and other things around quality of service. So from a technical perspective, I think the confidence was very, very, very high that this was going to be the release that customers were going to go to. And certainly the new customer wins validated our confidence in the value proposition. And this was the one that customers are going to migrate to. And all of that, everything that I previously said, remains unchanged. There is no evidence that customers are rejecting this technology or isn't meeting their expectations. That is not the story that we're getting. I mean clearly the flaw here on our part is that we underestimated the complexity of these transitions, the planning associated with it, and frankly, the dependence on us to help them through that. So I mean at the end of the day, I think these are the most sophisticated customers. These are our largest customers. These are the ones that are running high availability and the process changes, the getting downtime, downtime windows, all of that is proving to be a lot more complicated and a lot more time-consuming than we originally anticipated. So simply put, that's on us. That's entirely our fault and it's up to us to fix it. And the good news here is that there isn't a technical impediment. It isn't something that we wish we had or some technical invention that we need to have to complete the vision here. The product is what it is. It's exactly what we expected it to be, exactly what we wanted it to be, and we need to power through this and get our customers to transition. Nicholas R. Noviello - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Operations: Hey, Kulbinder. It's Nick. Let me address your question on the gross margin direction and the operating margin perspective for Q1. So the gross margin for Q1 should be in the 63% to 63.5% range. That includes about a point of foreign exchange pressure in there. I think to get to the operating margin, you have to be, have a couple of things in mind. One is this 14th week quarter we have, this is the once-in-a-six-year event type of thing. So if you build that in, we've actually taken the revenue down on a sequential basis much more substantially than we've done in prior Q4 to Q1 transition. So if I normalize out that 14th week, move in manufacturing that we're doing, I'm down about 15% sequentially versus my typical 10%. Right? You take that down at that 63% to 63.5% gross margin, then you have to go through the operating expense side of the fence. In essence, our operating expenses for the first quarter will be flat to Q4 before the 14th week. If you add in the 14th week, that's an additional about $40 million of expense. So I'm trying to walk you through the pieces of math here, but suffice it to say that the gross margin percentage range should be about 63% to 63.5%, including about a point \u2013 reflecting about a point of FX pressure. But you really have to think about the implications of the 14th week on operating expenses, which means operating expenses are going up by that, and then the implications of really what we're doing on the revenue side, which is saying, yes, we get some 14th-week benefit, however, we're taking a step down here to be reflective of the transition we're in. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Alexander from Raymond James. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Brian G. Alexander - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Nick, you said you'd return to normal growth in the second half of the year. I just wanted you to clarify that, because I think Q1 is going to be down low-double digits year over year. So are you expecting some well-above seasonal quarters in the back half to get to, to get the market growth, because it's just hard to make the math work on that? Nicholas R. Noviello - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Operations: Well, so first of all, Brian, a couple points. So what I'm saying in terms of revenue for the year is don't expect any more than flat. Okay? So what I'm saying in terms of the operating margins of the company, I would say that the operating margins in the back half we expect to be back in the range that we've talked about before, so I'm talking about beta (40:21) 18% to 20% range in the back half of the year. I also expect that from a cash flow perspective that as we get into that back half of the year we're going to be back to the cash flow ranges that we've talked about generating, which is the 17% to 19% on free cash flow. So I'm not talking about market growth here. What I'm talking about is don't expect more than flat revenues, but expect us from an operating model perspective to get back to those percentages we've talked about as a percentage of revenue for both our profit margin as well as cash, free cash flow as a percentage of revenue. And then I think the other thing here that I pointed out is that we've taken costs out and you should expect that we will be very focused on costs as we roll through this year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thank you. Tom, I was hoping you could give us a couple of metrics on how much your installed base has transitioned to clustered ONTAP, considering that it's taking a bit longer? I think you gave a number of 50% of the nodes are going to clustered ONTAP, so trying to reconcile that with the slow adoption by customers. I'm just trying to understand what gives you the confidence that customers will start to adopt clustered ONTAP later in the year. Thanks. Thomas Georgens - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. In terms of shipments, if you look at the various categories of the products, we are well over 50% of the shipments, we're over 70% of the bookings. Our largest machines are in the 80% range. Our mid-range machines are in the 70% range. And the low end of machines really weren't, because of a bunch of technical reasons, really weren't going to convert over to clustered ONTAP until 8.3, and that's happening now. So 50% of the models, but the models that are targeted for clustered ONTAP are well up in the two-thirds to three-quarters. But \u2013 and that's an important metric and one that we track constantly. It's not the only metric. The metric that's also important is what percentage of our installed base has converted over? So if customers are in a mode where \u2013 the methodology by which they convert to clustered ONTAP typically involves buy new equipment and then basically migrating the data over. So most big ONTAP transitions occur in conjunction with tech refreshes. So if the customers in the category are saying, okay, 8.3 is the least I'm looking for beginning to start my planning process, but I'm not going to buy hardware today and then move to it and then do another migration in the future. I'm going to do both of those at the same time. And that's where the delay comes in. So we could ship 100% of the new systems out the door with clustered ONTAP on them, but if old machines aren't being upgraded then those customers aren't buying those new systems. So that's really the key metric is which \u2013 what percentage of our big customers are moving to clustered ONTAP now? Now the question of, well, is there something else at play here? If one of the reasons was if they basically had lost their patience or they weren't going in a different direction, I think they would have gone there by now. Our issue at this particular point in time isn't that customers are waiting for the next 20 things to come along. Our issue is okay, this is the release, we've been waiting for these things, it's here now, how do we go about doing this process? And would they consider a competitor products at this point in time? If the reason that they've been delaying is because they've been waiting for new features to come along, they're not going to go to another product with even a more complicated migration that's actually missing even more features. So I think that the customers that are at this stage are onboard. They're continuing to do service renewals. We certainly see that. And we saw our deferred revenue actually grow year-over-year, which is an indication that people aren't buying the tech refreshes, which hurts us on the product side, but they are renewing and they are continuing to run this equipment, so it's not like they've made other decisions. And I think that as the equipment gets older and with 8.3 meeting their needs, there is a lot of pent-up business behind that and we need to power through it. And could we have been more prepared for it? Absolutely. That's the lesson we're learning here today. But that's the area, the constrained investment environment, that is the place that we are investing our money to get customers through this transition, because the other thing that we see in the data is that those customers that have successfully transitioned to clustered ONTAP, they are doing capacity expansion and software connect rates that are above the industry averages. So from our point of view is the healthiest thing we could do for our businesses is to gather as much of our installed base as possible to clustered ONTAP. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jayson Noland from Robert Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker): Okay. Great. Thank you. I wanted to ask about direct versus indirect. Tom, I believe you said there was a focus on regaining traction in the channel, but if you go back to the Analyst Day, there was some talk of consolidating to some of your larger partners. So just wondering how much of changes in the channel, excuse me, have had an impact on your business? Thomas Georgens - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, I think certainly as we look at our channel base, we have a very, very, very large number of channel partners and a very, very long tail of active partners that aren't doing a lot of business, and a lot of our business is concentrated at the top. So clearly making our largest partners more successful, has been a focus. And in fact, our largest partners actually had a pretty good year with us last year in terms of our reseller partners. I think the channel is also seeing the dynamics around clustered ONTAP. Those that have made the investments, some of our partners were the first to go; in fact that was going to be a differentiator for them and they were going to lead the way. And I think they've done a really good job in terms of getting their customers transitioned, being trained up and actually using this to sell to new accounts. Other of our partners who are back behind this, they're watching customers not necessarily upgrade and that's impacting not only the NetApp business but it's also impacting our mind share with them around the other elements of the portfolio. So as I look at the business, clearly, we got to get the channel partners trained up, get them through that transition, and we also need to get them actively engaged with the rest of the portfolio, both things that are ONTAP based like all-flash FAS as well as E-Series and OnCommand Insight and the rest of it. The one other point that I'd also point out is that it's not only direct and indirect. We look at our customers, we've talked about Storage 5000 in the past, but we have our largest accounts, our big global accounts, and for the first three quarters of this year those were all growing. And it says that where we've got account intensity, even despite these other issues with clustered ONTAP, we were selling other elements of the portfolio, particularly OnCommand Insight, which had a huge year in our big accounts. So where we had account intensity we could basically still drive growth despite the ONTAP slowdown, but it's taken a lot of resources to do it. The next generation of accounts will have adopted the next thousand accounts, beyond that we have what we used to call the rest of the Storage 5000, beyond that the mid-size business. Those bottom two categories which are primarily channel driven actually did reasonably well also. The category where we struggled was that next generation beyond the top global accounts, those are primarily direct led. They may be fulfilled indirect or not, but there is a big NetApp presence in those accounts. And I think that's where the dilution of resources came in. And as we spend a lot of time on our global accounts, make sure we shored them up, but we've not been nearly as diligent on that next thousand. And my simple observation as I watch the business is yeah, there is kind of a tough macro backdrop, there aren't as many deals as there used to be. But when there is business and when we show up and when we compete, we're winning more than our fair share. So win rate is not our issue. We need to be in front of more accounts. And that next thousand is an area focus. That's why we talked about clustered ONTAP transition, we talked about investment in the channel, but we just plain need more sales capacity to be telling this story to more people, and there is just as much conviction about that now as there was 90 days ago, and we're in a situation now where we're back to full strength. We're continuing to investment beyond that, but we also have to go through the training cycle and get people up to speed, and that's kind of where the state of play is here. But there is no doubt that when we show up in front of our people, or our trained partners are in front of people that NetApp can close and NetApp can win. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Maynard Um from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Maynard J. Um - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Thanks. I just wanted to focus a little bit on the back half and the recovery and the confidence you have. Are customers indicating they have migration plans? Or is this \u2013 how long does a typical migration take? Is this purely a function of having enough people to do the migration? Or are you kind of going under the assumption that the one-year service renewals will convert to product sales at the end of the extensions? And then just directly related to that, understanding customers are unlikely to move to other on-prem solutions, is there any reason why we shouldn't anticipate that customers might use this transition to negotiate price, because it sounds like the gross margins are going to go back to sort of the normalized level, so I'm just curious why you wouldn't anticipate that in a transition like this? Thanks. Thomas Georgens - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I mean, these migrations, I don't want to use the word complete around them per se. Some of these migrations and individual customers include hundreds, if not thousands of machines in dozens of countries. And so there is a planning cycle that they need to get through that they could start a migration. So they could be doing migrations through that entire estate over an extended period of time, and that's okay. Well, we can't be in a situation where they aren't starting that process because they're in the planning cycle, and we need to help them with that. So when we talk about investments and helping them through that, in some of those cases we will be directly involved. And in some of those cases where they're very, very strategic and there is a lot of business behind it, we're willing to do that at our own expense because it's in our best interest to do so and the customer's best interest to do so. But the goal is on these really, really big accounts, once they get this thing rolling, you will have a process and it may take some time. But while they were in the planning cycle, at least for that use case and that workload that's on that equipment, they're not inclined to basically make big hardware purchases around equipment that they aren't going to use right away. So from our point of view, it's what can we do to get them over this initial cycle, which is a lot of planning, letting them learn the tools that we have and also in our case, perhaps putting our own professional services resources against this problem and in some cases perhaps even giving them some gear. That's not going to be the dominant case, we're not going to be able to do that across the board. But for some of the big accounts that we need to get going, that are willing to make that commitment if we're willing to invest and help them, that is already underway and we're doing that now in some very, very large accounts. Nicholas R. Noviello - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Operations: Maynard, it's Nick. Why don't I just point out, we talked about a reduction in gross margin by about a point for the fiscal year. Actually, half of that point is going to be related to foreign exchange, obviously, from the first half of the year. We're going to normalize through that. So yes, there is investment built in, but there is also foreign exchange built in, so you should try to keep that in mind. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lou Miscioscia from CLSA. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Louis R. Miscioscia - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. Thanks, Tom. I guess you've talked about the cloud, but there is many shifts that are going on in storage. You've got a product in the converged category doing well there, congratulations, but when you look at hyper-converged, hyperscale, the start-ups like Nimble and Tintri, software-defined, object storage, I know you've got a product there, and then obviously, just the cloud storage vendors or the cloud companies in general, I mean how do you rank these as secular shifts that are hurting you and possibly going back to your comment that you've lost a bit of share this year in conjunction, obviously, with what you've talked about with ONTAP? Thomas Georgens - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, I think a treatise on all those topics could take a long time, but I think \u2013 we talked about radical transitions. The radical transition is the cloud, and the cloud dwarfs the impact of any of those other technologies. And some of these small companies, their incremental revenue year-over-year might be $50 million or $30 million or $100 million, and you look at the kind of money that's being invested in the cloud, and the cloud is not just the hyperscalers, it's also things like Microsoft Office 365 and Exchange and things like that that are moving to the cloud. So the cloud transition dwarfs all other transitions. Everything else is technology based, and NetApp is a technology company, and the areas that we invest in we are confident in our ability to basically lead that technology and take leadership positions in those areas. So don't minimize the technology stuff. It's work, it's engineering, it's hard, but that's what we do. The cloud is clearly the much \u2013 the thing that's roiling the industry at this point in time. There's no doubt about that. And our view on the cloud is rather than either deny the cloud or declare it a fad, or fight against it or position them as the competition, our view is to embrace the cloud, find a way to monetize it. And that's the rationale between the evolution of our product offerings. We talked about NetApp private storage, where the data remains on your network but you have access to the flexible compute of Amazon and SoftLayer and Microsoft. We've got Cloud ONTAP, the ability to actually run ONTAP, build a virtual machine in the cloud, a virtual system in the cloud and buy it by the hour. And at the end of the day, the story is, is that, the cloud is going to be part of everybody's environment. It won't be everything. We're a firm believer that everybody is going to have some combination of owned infrastructure and cloud infrastructure, and our job as a company, since our strength is data management, is how do we make that data management experience seamless across all of those domains? So one set of tools, one set of processes, one set of backup, one set of replication, whether data is on our equipment or not, or whether it's on-premise are not. And that's the value proposition that we're driving. And that's our definition of software defined. In fact, that's the epitome of software-defined. It's not a point solution for certain workloads. It's not some thin veneer of software over some very dissimilar hardware. This is one set of tools across all of these use cases. So as far as the cloud is concerned, that is the thing that customers are talking about. Everything else, I'm not going to minimize it, we could talk about each one individually if you want, but the cloud is the big change. That's the one that's driving our strategy. And I've been doing a lot of these cloud pitches. I know some of you have seen the initial version of that at Insight, but it works, and we have a lot of momentum around it. Simply put, ONTAP on-premise is the story and the nut that we need to crack in the near-term. The rest of it, whether it be our new products, whether it be our cloud strategy, that is clearly working for us and I'm extremely pleased with how that's going. Operator : Our next question comes from Keith Bachman from Bank of Montr\u00e9al. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Hi, Tom. Thank you. I wanted to ask about first on competition. You talked a lot about on the call the transition to 8.3, but if you could speak to in terms of new workloads or jump balls as I think about it, how do you see the level of competition there? And related, do you think your installed base is flat or declining at this point? And then I wanted to ask a follow-up, too. But let's start with that one, please. Thomas Georgens - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, the installed base is measured in units is actually growing and growing quite, quite substantially every year. So that \u2013 and that's a function of equipment not taking out of service, plus the thousands of new systems that we put out there every day. What we are not seeing is a bunch of machines that mysteriously are no longer being operated and dropping out of our order reporting database. So these machines are reporting back, which means that they are live, customers are applying maintenance on them. So that installed base is continuing to grow. So if there was this big competitive push that was taking us out of all those environments, we would effectively be seeing that go away, and we're not. Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Right. Thomas Georgens - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : In terms of the broader competitive landscape, certainly EMC and the other server vendors, there is usually one of them in every transaction that we do or every competitive situation that we're in. We certainly see the start-up vendors certainly not underestimating, but they are not ubiquitous like the other guys are. Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Right. Thomas Georgens - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : In terms of jump ball workloads, I think they fall into a bunch of different categories, whether it be analytic workloads, whether it be virtual desktop workloads, whether it be new apps workloads, webscale-type of things. I think where we're seeing the cloud and new application development is around a lot of these new workloads. Whether Hadoop is an on-premise solution, or whether we see analytics in the cloud, whether it be some of the customer service, whether it be the mobile apps, those types of things. And I think that those are very, very much a jump ball. I think as far as the other vendors, I'd say certainly the hyper-converge, we see them in those domains. Flash is a little bit different, I think a lot of the flash battlefield is around some of the new workloads, particularly virtual desktop, but that's not big enough to support everybody's flash investment. The other place where we clearly see flash is basically application acceleration in database, and generically high-performance SAN. So for NetApp, high-performance SAN has not been a historical strength of ours. Certainly with clustered ONTAP we want to compete more aggressively there, but that's not the installed base. It's not the NetApp installed base that's being fought over in the high-performance SAN market. So that's an opportunity that with clustered ONTAP and new, now with the all-flash FAS, the latest release and the performance benchmarks that we have that are compelling, it's something that we want to compete on more aggressively. So I'd say it depends on the workload. I think the cloud is more relevant to next-gen workloads. And then we're starting to see flash around things like VDI, but a lot of it around accelerating traditional workloads, particularly around database acceleration. Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Fair enough. And I just wanted to ask a follow up, Nick. Nick, what happens if your assumptions surrounding your growth potential and transition of 8.3 are incorrect? That is to say we get deeper into the year and NetApp continues to not be able to realize what you believe to be your growth potential. Nick mentioned you're taking out about 4% of your head count out in the risk. Do you see more opportunities if need be as you look out over the next number of quarters where NetApp could skinny up meaningfully, reduce its cost structure if that is what the situation warranted? Thomas Georgens - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, actually I'm glad you ended the conversation that way. I think the lay of the land now based on kind of what we believe is achievable the rest of the year gets us back to our operating model in the second half. And the balance that we have clearly is we spend a lot of time on this portfolio, we know there are things that are under our control that if we can overpower it we believe can unlock growth, and at this point in time I don't want to preclude our ability to do that. So we're making the investments to go after that and go after that aggressively. If it turns out that either the macro substantially deteriorates or our postulate is not correct, although we're pretty convinced that we're on the right track, or any number of other things come in the way and the business doesn't materialize, then clearly our current operating hypothesis will be invalidated and we're going to have to do other things. So certainly there is an opportunity to take more cost out of the infrastructure. I think to take more cost out of the infrastructure now when we know what big bets that we think we're on the cusp of realizing over the next six months to start to see impacts, then I think we want to make those bets now. But if they don't materialize, then clearly we need to rethink what we think the long-term growth rate of this business is, what we think the long-term growth rate of this industry is, and we have to look at our cost structure. So we're not wedded to a dollar figure on the cost structure at this point in time. We're going to be practical. At this point, we took out a certain amount of head count, we took out well more than that and other infrastructure costs in the company, took a couple hundred million dollars out. So we're prepared to do more if the situation warrants, but right now I think we have a structure that enables us to still compete for this business. And if we're right in our hypothesis, then I think we win. And I think that we will be well served by preserving the investments we're making right now. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks a lot. Nick, I just maybe wanted go through the math for the full-year revenue expectations that are no better than zero percent growth I guess. If I look historically, July quarter fiscal Q1 tends to be about 23%, 23.5% of the full-year revenue contributions. If I play that out this time around, I get your sales to be down 9%, 10%. So I'm just curious, which of the next three quarters you think will punch in more than their historical weight to get you to a better trend than down 8%, 9%? If you maybe just help understand that math, that would be helpful. Nicholas R. Noviello - Chief Financial Officer & Executive VP-Operations: Yeah. Now, remember, what I'd also indicated at the beginning of this call was that we took down the front quarter associated with this transition, and we expect this transition to get its legs under it and get moving as we get to the back half of the year. So I do expect that the linearity is going to be a little different and that we will be back-end loaded. In addition to that, as you know, we're not going to have an FX compare in the second half of the year, at least at these rates. So it's really the combination of those two things that you should think about in terms of the revenue and the no better than flat revenue guidance that we gave. Thomas Georgens - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. So first of all, thank you all for joining us on the call today. And if I look at where we are right now, we spend a lot of time talking about our cloud strategy and while early days and not moving the top-line needle, or not moving it enough, overall that story is working out well for us. If I look at the new products in the portfolio, the E-Series, the OnCommand Insight, those are meaningful businesses, over $100 million each growing 100% per year. I think we're quite pleased with that. Clearly the situation that we're in now and the thing that we need to be very, very focused on, and we need to work our way through is this transition from 7-Mode to clustered ONTAP. And clearly we did not do a good enough job anticipating or putting in place the resources necessary to make that go smoothly for our customers, but that's something we can control and that's something that we can do. It's not a technical impediment for us going forward we just need to get on to these key initiatives that we talked about : getting clustered ONTAP transition; getting our channel partners up to speed and ready and regaining traction with them; and expanding our sales capacity and telling our story to more customers. So those are the bets. Those are entirely within our control. I see a direct line to success in those activities to ultimately revenue growth and that's how we can make the comments about the second half of the year. So thank you very much for your time, thank you for your support, and look forward to seeing you all in 90 days. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we'll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call may be recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Newton, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin. Kris Newton : Hello and thank you for joining us on our Q1 fiscal year 2016 earnings call. With me today are CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Nick Noviello. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com along with the earnings release, our financial tables, a historical supplemental data table and the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation. As a reminder, during today's call we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects such as our guidance for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2016, our expectations regarding our ability to respond to changing demands of our customers, our ability to manage our portfolio to drive efficiency, profitability and growth, our expectations regarding market acceptance of Clustered Data ONTAP, our ability to drive operational and financial performance, our expectations regarding our business model in FY'16 all of which involve risk and uncertainty. Such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and are being made as of today. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons. We describe some of these reasons in our accompanying press release, which we have furnished to the SEC on a Form 8-K. Please refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, specifically our Form 10-K for fiscal year 2015 and our current reports on Form 8-K, all of which can be found on our website. During the call all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise noted. These non-GAAP measures are not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. A reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP results is provided in today's press release and on our website. I'll now turn the call over to George. George Kurian : Thank you, Kris, and good afternoon. This is my first earnings call as NetApp's CEO and it's an honor to be here. We delivered revenue above the midpoint of our prior guidance with gross margin, operating margin and EPS all above our previous guidance ranges. We did what we said we would, but we're clear that we have a lot more work to do. We're committed to helping our customers navigate their IT transformations to improving our own execution and to enhancing value for our shareholders. We're making progress against our plan, adding new customers and expanding the adoption of our portfolio by aggressively pivoting towards modern architectures such as scale out software defined flash, converged and hybrid cloud, all while planning to return to our operating models in the second half of this fiscal year. This is my first time addressing many of you and what you'll hear from me today is the focus on portfolio management, execution and enhancing shareholder value. I want to start by sharing my views on how I think about managing our business and how we're shaping our strategy to respond to the transformation in the IT industry to increase efficiency and to deliver strong financial returns. Then I'll provide an update on our business in the quarter and hand it over to Nick to cover our financial results before we open the call for Q&A. In my first days as CEO, I spent time to ensure that we had a well articulated view of the industry transition and a clear understanding of customers, IT transformation priorities, but this alone is not enough. To maximize results from our strong portfolio of technologies we need to operate the business with a greater level of discipline and to align resources against our most important priorities. In addition to improving alignment and inspection, you can expect from me highly disciplined portfolio management across all aspects of the business; technology, customers and go-to-market. We must manage the business to drive efficiency and profitability from the mature parts of our portfolio so we can afford investment in emerging high growth areas to deliver innovation ahead of the market, drive increased awareness and expand our footprint. You can expect to hear about the results of this rigorous portfolio management as we come back over successful quarters. The requirement for digital capabilities and cloud-based solutions is driving fundamental change across the IT industry. Enterprises must transform in order to survive and data management is the heart of the transition they need to make. Whether it's dealing with data growth efficiently, drawing real time insight from data or integrating data across their globally distributed value chain, managing data is of great importance to our customers. This is where NetApp has a profoundly important role to play. We're the only company that can help customers manage their data seamlessly across multiple cloud architectures and provide the scale needed to accommodate the exponential data growth generated by the digital world. This is what I see as our big opportunity. To accelerate this transformation, customers are seeking to take advantage of new applications and modern data center storage and data management architectures. This implies a reduced opportunity in the traditional storage market, but at the same time, growth in new areas such as scale out storage, software defined flash converged and hybrid cloud. We are and will continue to actively drive a shift within our product and go-to-market portfolio to meet the changing demands of our customers and you will see me drive a more disciplined approach around managing this portfolio, both to increase focus on the growth and emerging parts of our business and to drive efficiency in the mature parts. As customers transform their IT environments, they are reducing their spend on traditional storage, which has put pressure on our ONTAP 7-Mode business. The 7-Mode storage operating system was shipped in only 35% of FAS units in the quarter, down from roughly 75% a year ago. Customers are also slowing investment in the capacity expansion of their traditional storage environments. Both of these dynamics lowered new unit shipments off and lower incremental capacity in ONTAP 7-Mode systems put downward pressure on our product revenue, despite strong growth in other parts of our business. We've a heightened sense of urgency in working with our customers to enable their move to the modern architectures delivered by our portfolio. As customers replace their traditional storage architectures and transform their data centers, they want scale out and software defined storage functionality to both mange data growth efficiently and deliver service provider like flexibility. Clustered Data ONTAP provides this through a highly efficient, multi-tenant, non-stop shared storage infrastructure to replace legacy stovepipe architectures for enterprise applications like databases, virtualization, VDI and eCommerce. Clustered ONTAP also enables customers to seamlessly manage their applications and data across flash, disk and cloud footprints and as customers plan their hybrid cloud architectures the software-defined architecture of Clustered ONTAP provides a consistent way to manage data across private and public clouds regardless of underlying hardware. Clustered ONTAP was deployed on 65% of the FAS systems shipped in Q1 up from roughly 25% a year ago. Unit shipments of Clustered ONTAP systems grew by approximately 115% the 13th consecutive quarter of triple digit growth. The value proposition of Clustered ONTAP for the next generation datacenter is strong as evidenced by continued rapid customer adoption. We are migrating our installed based customers to Clustered ONTAP and gaining new customers in competitive environments. The number of customers using Clustered ONTAP grew by more than 130% in Q1 from Q1 a year ago. The fastest growth was in new to NetApp customers, which grew 225%. Let me give you some examples to illustrate why new customers are choosing NetApp. We won the business of a mid-size Internet radio provider who had moved off a leading hyperscale cloud service provider due to cost and on to a solutions from one of the startups. Ultimately that infrastructure could not scale to meet the customer's needs so they turned to Clustered ONTAP for its ability to spread the load across multiple controllers and for its virtual storage sharing capability, which efficiently priorities workloads. At a multi-billion construction services company, we replace an established vendor. Clustered ONTAP was able to solve their problem with less hardware and greater flexibility. In addition to buying new systems from us, the customer is also using our FlexArray software to run Clustered ONTAP on the un-depreciated hardware assets their now legacy vendor. We told you last quarter that we\u2019ll make investments to accelerate the migrations of our customer's ONTAP 7-mode installed base to Clustered ONTAP and we have. Our transition programs offer customers and certified partners with transition support, temporary gear and financial incentives. Just formalized in Q1 this program is already showing early results. A large semiconductor manufacturer in Asia Pacific building its private cloud and Clustered ONTAP leveraged the program to deploy a cluster of All Flash FAS systems, beating out flash offerings from established and emerging vendors and they plan to migrate additional 7-mode systems in the future to Clustered ONTAP. A U.S. based multi-campus university is replacing its existing storage silos systems from NetApp and multiple competitors. They will standardize on Clustered ONTAP and OnCommand insight to provide services for all of their campuses and medical centers. Only NetApp could fulfill their performance archive and reporting needs. Over the course of fiscal '16 we will continue to refine and expand our transition programs. Customers are seeking to gain competitive advantage and economic benefits from accelerating business transactions, processes and their supporting enterprise applications. To do so they're deploying high-performance enterprise grade flash technology. Our All Flash FAS products offer built-in data protection, multi-protocol support, scale out performance and seamless data movement from flash, to disk, to cloud. These benefits have driven rapid customer adoption of our All Flash FAS solution with unit shipments growing almost 140% year-on-year, the fifth consecutive quarter of triple-digit growth. In Q1 we launched new lower cost All Flash FAS products with flash essentials innovations to improve performance and efficiency. Customer reception to this launch has been tremendous and we saw a strong uptick in All-flash FAS sales momentum during the quarter. We had significant and growing numbers of competitive wins against established and emerging flash-only vendors. For example at a major software-as-a-service provider, designing their next generation infrastructure to migrate from a traditional database architecture to an in-memory architecture, All-flash FAS beat solutions from both established and emerging flash only and hybrid flash competitors. At a leading online retail financial services company with demanding mission-critical applications that monitor and analyze trading data throughout the day the EF series All-flash arrays easily outperformed all of the leading competitors. To improve business insight and decision making, customers are also deploying new web scale and analytic applications like Hadoop and Splunk as well as increasing the amount of data that they retain online. To support the performance, availability and cost requirements of these applications customers are using our E series platforms. As we aggressively target this part of the market, we see continued growth of the E series platforms with unit shipments up almost 50% from Q1 last year. To help with the additional transformation and to better manage their IT portfolio customers over the medium to long term are looking to enable hybrid cloud architectures. The challenge of the hybrid cloud is that it is a series of isolated and incompatible data silos. Every cloud provider has a different way to manage data, making it difficult for customers to move and share data across clouds. Our customers are looking for a consistent way to secure and manage data regardless of location and our focus on data management enables customers to utilize cloud resources while leveraging existing investments and maintaining control of their data. Our hybrid cloud solutions are important in positioning us ahead of the market, but do not contribute meaningfully to revenue today. The products included in our hybrid cloud solution portfolio are NetApp private storage for cloud, Cloud ONTAP, StorageGRID Webscale and AltaVault. Of these, NetApp private storage represents the largest opportunity. It enables customers to take advantage of the elastic compute resources of multiple clouds for cloud bursting or data analytics while maintaining complete control of their data. Cloud ONTAP is a rent by the hour version of Clustered Data ONTAP available on Amazon web services for used cases such as agile software development. The number of hours of usage continues to grow nicely with hours of usage more than doubling from last quarter. AltaVault is the most recent addition to this part of our portfolio. It helps customers preserve the investments in their existing backup software while enabling them to take advantage of low cost cloud storage as a long-term back-up and archival target. In Q1, we announced new AltaVault solutions and extended service offerings. Our hybrid cloud portfolio is delivering strategic wins. We've had several NetApp private storage wins at companies with strong cloud mandates because it enables them to leverage cloud resources while avoiding data governance risk and data mobility challenges. We gained a foothold in a new financial services customer with AltaVault displacing our leading competitor's Legacy Backup Solutions because of our ability to unlock the economics of cloud for backup. With StorageGRID Webscale, we beat established and emerging vendors at a photo sharing cloud provider because it enabled the customer to leverage their existing infrastructure while moving to object storage for data management at Webscale. Finally, customers are looking for pre-integrated converged solutions. Today NetApp offers the highly successful FlexPod converged system in conjunction with Cisco. You can expect to see exciting innovations on FlexPod this year. We recently began shipping NetApp integrated EVO :RAIL Solutions bringing the proven benefits of NetApp storage for VMware to hyper converged form factor. We will continue to monitor the evolution of hyper converged infrastructure. As we move to better address the growth areas of the storage market, our confidence in our direction comes from our customers. Our strategy and technology portfolio resonate with enterprises and service providers positioning us as a strategic advisor to assist them through their IT and digital transformations. As I've said elements of our technology portfolio are growing rapidly. We're shifting investments in our go-to-market teams to accelerate that growth and those actions are showing early signs of success. We added incremental sales headcount in Q4 of last year and the beginning of this year and they're already driving meaningful expansion to our pipeline. We also took action to regain traction in our channel. We added a Global Channel Chief, a worldwide channel leadership team and made investments in channel marketing programs, all by reallocating resources within our operating expense envelope. I personally have met with partners in the Americas and EMEA and have seen their excitement over the opportunity with NetApp. Be clear that we have a sense of urgency and a high level of focus to ensure that our investments continue to translate into productive sales conversations and ultimately pipeline and bookings growth. We expect that investments in Clustered ONTAP transitions, sales capacity and channel traction, combined with our shift to better address the industry trends will deliver improving results over the course of this fiscal year and we're committed to returning to our target operating model in the second half. We continue to work through the declines in the mature part of our business, but are encouraged by the many areas of growth. Before I had it over to Nick to go over the quarter in more detail, I would like to summarize by saying, our strategy is to assist our customer's IT transformation with a unique and differentiated vision for data management. We plan to deliver against this vision by actively pivoting the company to execute against the industry trends of scale out, software defined storage flash, converged infrastructure and hybrid cloud data management and at the same time, we have an intense focus on disciplined cost management and cost structure. We are confident that we're on the right path, but clearly have more work to do. I will focus on driving disciplined portfolio management, streamline decision making for efficiency alignment and accountability and instill more rigorous inspection and corrective action for high performance execution. As I continue my rigorous analysis of the business, these plus understanding our customer's plans to consume technology are all considerations that I'll take into account as we position the company for success and increase shareholder value. On our next quarterly earnings call, I'll have more details to share with you. I am excited for the future. The feedback from our customers on our technology and strategic direction has been strongly positive. Partners feel confident that our portfolio provides a unique value proposition for them and their customers and by raising the bar on our execution and actively addressing the industry trends, we will emerge from this transition a stronger, more focused and disciplined company. I'll now pass it over to Nick. Nick Noviello : Thank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. NetApp delivered Q1 results that were generally on track and in line with our expectations. As George highlighted, the storage industry is in transition as customers drive IT transformations to take advantage of new technologies and architectures, while planning their journey to the hybrid cloud. As you know, this industry transition has impacted our business as well. We've embarked on a new chapter and we're aggressively shifting our efforts to better position ourselves for the future. We saw progress on many fronts in Q1, but we still have a lot of work ahead. For the first half of fiscal year 2016, we're raising the bar on execution across all aspects of the business. For the second half of the year, you can expect us to deliver against our plan and return to our target operating margins. Beyond fiscal 2016 we will do a much better job demonstrating our broad value proposition to customers and translating that to financial results top and bottom line and increased shareholder value. Please note that I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers in today\u2019s presentation unless otherwise indicated. Fiscal Q1 net revenues were $1.34 billion down about 13% sequentially and down 10% year-over-year. FX headwinds had an unfavorable impact of about four points on the year-over-year comparison. We estimate that the extra week in Q1 which occurs every six years to realign fiscal and calendar months added approximately $40 million of revenue to the quarter. Product revenue was $664 million in the first quarter, down 27% sequentially and 25% year-over-year. FX headwinds had an unfavorable impact on the year-over-year product revenue comparison by about five points. The decline in product revenue due largely to the decline in ONTAP 7-Mode sales was in line with our expectations and prior guidance. The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenues primarily comprised of existing, new and renewed service contracts was $671 million in the first quarter up 7% sequentially and up 11% year-over-year. The increase reflects the continued growth of installed base and short term renewals from existing customers as well as the benefit from the extra week in Q1. In direct revenue through the channels and OEMs was 77% of Q1 net revenues compared to 78% in Q4 and 76% in Q1 of last year. Gross margin of 63.6% was down just under a point from Q1 last year and was negatively impacted by about a point from FX consistent with our prior expectations. Product gross margin was 51.2% reflecting a decline of about six points year-over-year. Roughly half of this decline was due to FX headwinds with the remainder from lower volume, unfavorable product mix and some higher discounting. Software maintenance gross margin was relatively flat year-over-year while hardware maintenance and other services gross margin was up just under a point and half reflecting increased revenue and leverage of existing infrastructure investments and the benefit of the 14th week. Operating expenses of $746 million were up 3% year-over-year. FX reduced operating expenses by about four points on a year-over-year basis and consistent with my comments last quarter the 14th week contributed about $41 million of sequential growth. Operating margin of 7.7% was above our previous guidance range driven by lower spending and the benefit of our previously announced realignment action on largely inline revenues and gross margins. Our realignment actions resulted in a headcount reduction of approximately 3% and a GAAP restructuring charge of approximately $27 million in the quarter. Our effective tax rate for the quarter and projected rate for the year was 17% up half a point from Q1 last year due to greater investment income in our foreign subsidiaries taxed at U.S. rates. Q1 weighted average diluted share count of 308 million shares decreased by approximately five million shares sequentially due to share repurchase activity in the quarter. EPS was $0.29, $0.04 over the high end of our prior guidance range driven by higher operating margin and lower diluted share count. Now turning to cash and balance sheet metrics, we closed Q1 with $5 billion in cash and short term investments, approximately 8% of which was held by our domestic entities. Inventory turns decreased to 10 due in part to our factory move, which is now complete. I anticipate inventory turns returning to a normalized mid to high teens level in Q2 and in fact much of the additional inventory we built up during Q1 has already been shipped. Q1 day sales outstanding decreased to 30 days due to invoicing occurring earlier in the quarter and an extra week of collections from the 14th week. Deferred revenue decreased by $131 million in Q1 versus Q4 and decreased $10 million from Q1 last year. We expected the decline, about $40 million of which was due to the 14th week and the remainder commensurate with the decline in product revenue. Q1 cash from operations was approximately $129 million versus $216 million in Q1 a year ago. At 7% of revenue, free cash flow was down as expected due to lower net income resulting from the year-over-year revenue decline. We repurchased approximately $430 million of our stock and paid $54 million in cash dividends during the quarter. As you may recall, Board of Directors authorized $2.5 billion of repurchases by the end of May 2018 with the first $1 billion of repurchases expected to be completed by the end of May 2016. Today we announced our next cash dividend of $0.18 per share of the company's stock that will be paid on October 21, 2015. Now I would like to spend a few minutes discussing our business outlook and guidance. As I discussed earlier, fiscal year 2016 is one of transition. We're aggressively focused on our top priorities, rebuilding pipeline and momentum in the first half of the year and executing against our plan to return to our targeted operating model for the second half of the year. We've a strong portfolio of technologies booked into a better job of fully monetizing it. With George at the helm, we're doing a deeper dive to understand our business and market opportunity beyond this fiscal year. You can expect to hear from us on our next quarterly earnings call with a further update on how we expect to evolve the business to deliver greater value to customers and shareholders. For fiscal 2016, we now expect revenue to be down about 5% with impact from FX headwinds and limited topline predictability in the first half of the year easing in the second half. Though ultimately dependent on revenue mix, growth and our continued actions to drive down cost, we expect fiscal 2016 gross margin as a percentage of revenue to be down about one point from fiscal 2015. We expect operating margin as a percentage of revenue to be down about two points for the year with a challenging first half and a return to our 18% to 20% target operating margin range for the second half. Although off to a slow start in the first quarter, we expect a year of continued cash flow generation with free cash flow as a percentage of revenue for the year in the mid teens. Finally we remain committed to driving shareholder value through share repurchases and dividends. Based on current stock prices, we expect to reduce share count in fiscal 2016 by approximately 5% and between dividends and share repurchases, we will again return over 100% of free cash flow generated to shareholders in fiscal 2016. For Q2 we expect continued FX headwinds and limited topline predictability as we rebuild pipeline and momentum. As such, we expect net revenues for Q2 to range between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, which at the midpoint implies a sequential increase of approximately 9% and a 6% decrease year-over-year. We expect Q2 consolidated gross margins of approximately 63% to 63.5% and operating margins of approximately 14% to 15%. Based on our share repurchases in Q1 and in the first 10 days of Q2, we expect our diluted share count for the quarter to be approximately 303 million shares and earnings per share for Q2 to range from approximately $0.55 to $0.60 per share. In summary, we're confident in our differentiated strategy for data management in hybrid cloud. We're shifting our investments and efforts to accelerate growth in the areas of our portfolio that address our customer's most pressing IT imperatives. FY'16 is a year of transition as we rebuild our pipeline, help customers through their IT transition and return the business to our targeted operating model. The positive feedback we've received from customers and partners reinforce our confidence in our directions. Last but not least, I\u2019m excited about the change that George, brings as a CEO of NetApp. I believe his focus on portfolio management, execution, and shareholder value combined with his perspective and frank assessment of the entirety of our business will yield positive results for partners, customers and shareholders. At this point, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Kris to open it up for questions and answers. Kris? Kris Newton : We\u2019ll now open the call for Q&A. Please be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to one question so we can get to as many people as possible. Thanks for your cooperation. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Amit Daryanani : Thanks a lot. Good afternoon, guys. And congrats George on a nice start to the job. I guess my question really is when you think about the initiatives and the execution improvement you\u2019re talking about, how do you think about -- is there room for cost curtailment as you go forward, because even if I take the assumptions for fiscal '16, you'll probably exit the year with low single-digit revenue growth in a good scenario. In that case do you think 45%, 50% of sales going to expenses is a reasonable target for a company to have or do you think there is room for that to lower and if so, what are the levers or what are the metrics you could do to lower that operating expense structure? George Kurian : We have been and continue to be disciplined around the cost structure of the company. I think if you look into our plans for this fiscal year, there are already expense containment strategies in place that improve the target operating model of the company back to our guidance range within the second half of the year. So we have plans already in place. I continue to inspect them and I\u2019m also rigorous that we align the resources of the company against the biggest opportunities and harvest the mature parts of our portfolio for profit. In addition both Nick and I are studying the evolution of the storage market and we\u2019ll have a broader perspective to you about the operating structure of the company as well as the way to maximize both the return on our assets as well as shareholder value at our next earnings call. Nick Noviello : Hey Amit it\u2019s Nick as well, let me just get real granular for a second. If I look on a year-over-year perspective or first half to second half perspective, I would expect that the expenses of the company, the operating expenses would be down in the second half of the year. So we have operating plans and we\u2019re operating against all of those plans across the functions to achieve just that. We also have the additional levers of gross margin that you can imagine we always look at. We always look at our spending there. We always look at our structure on that side, work for suppliers etcetera and then even to go further up the stack the value we get out of our software value proposition. Kris Newton : Thanks Amit. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Sherri Scribner : Hi thanks. I just wanted to get a sense from you George. On the last call we heard a lot about customers waiting to transition to Clustered ONTAP, I want to understand what change this quarter and what makes you confident in the growth for the next quarter? You're guiding to up 9%. What are you seeing that\u2019s making you confident about that? Thank you. George Kurian : The growth that we see is from both the investments in sales capacity translating to pipeline expansion and is a combination of customer acquisitions and usage of Clustered Data ONTAP for new workloads within existing customers. The pace of transitions from 7-Mode to Clustered ONTAP within our install base will be benefited from the work that we\u2019re doing to make it easier for customers to transition but will be prioritized against their broader landscape of IT priorities. So we are by no means counting on just installed base transitions to drive growth. We\u2019re counting on the pipeline expansion and the capacity investment that we\u2019re making to drive that upside. Kris Newton : Thanks Sherri. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kurtz of Sterne Agee. Your line is now open. Alex Kurtz : Yeah thanks for taking the question guys. Nick, just on the product margin in the quarter, it sounds like maybe FX had some impact here, but this is one of the lowest prints you put up in a while. Was there mix issues there or were there any component issues. And as you look at the second half statements you\u2019re making on operating leverage so what is your expectation for product mark and recovery as we get into Q3 and Q4? Nick Noviello : Yeah. Thanks Alex. So just to be clear so on that product gross margin for Q1 versus Q1 a year ago, yes it was a pretty significant decline in gross margin percentage. Half of that was FX all by itself okay. So you're seeing that FX really hitting the product side of the fence versus the deferred side of the fence. In addition to that, it\u2019s a combination of volume and mix which you would expect given the rebuild of the pipeline and some discounting. So we talked about discounting last quarter. We talked about again discounting this quarter. I indicated that I would talk about that to the degree that it changes on a year-over-year basis. So you can imagine with a lower pipeline and a need to rebuild those are the types of things we have to work through. Over the course of the year in terms of product gross margin, we\u2019re going to expect that FX certainly fades in the back half of the year. We shouldn\u2019t have assuming there is not another dramatic change out there, we shouldn\u2019t have the type of compares we\u2019ve had. So we\u2019ll back to the typical which is looking at the mix of business. We'll be looking at the combination of pricing, discounting and savings of the supply chain to really look at the gross margin there. So that\u2019s probably the good perspective for you. Alex Kurtz : All right, thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Katy Huberty : Yes, thanks as it relates to hitting the target model in the back half of the year, can you get there with the current booked maintenance and cost cuts and the gross margin acceleration that you\u2019ve talked about already? Would you need the product revenue to grow again in the back half to hit the target? Thank you. Nick Noviello : Yes Katy, let me start on that and if George has a perspective he can weigh in as well. Remember the first half of this year was about pipeline rebuild. We\u2019re talking about pipeline rebuilds from a perspective of rebuilding sales capacity, of channel investments, of C-DOT transition programs and we\u2019re seeing the beginning of those things. So in terms of the back half of the year, what we expected to happen and what we\u2019re seeing the early -- the green shoots on if you will, those metrics are coming in and they\u2019re starting to build and we expect to monetize some of that in the second half. Is it a dramatic shift of product revenue from the second quarter, let\u2019s say to the third or the fourth, I wouldn\u2019t call it a dramatic shift. Certainly the first quarter was impaired and we knew that coming into the first quarter. The maintenance streams of the company, we can look at those year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter and that's reflective of that installed base. The installed base as we indicated continues to grow. It\u2019s a combination of new renewal and that and we see that -- sometimes we see that in short terms. Sometimes we see that in longer term thesis. So is there a dramatic shift from the second quarter to the second half of the year, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a dramatic shift. Obviously we expect some uptick in terms of product revenue. We will no longer hopefully have the FX pressure on product revenue, but certainly Q1 was a low point and Q1 was reflective of what happened to the pipeline and Q1 is really the area where we\u2019re going to be the lowest. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Alexander of Raymond James. Your line is now open. Brian Alexander : Yes just following on to that, the revenue guidance up 5% to 12% sequentially Nick is the most growth you\u2019ve guided to for a July quarter in many years. So can you just talk about your confidence level and the key drivers of what appears to be an above seasonal growth outlook and specifically how should we think about on a sequential basis, the product revenue versus software and services? Thanks. Nick Noviello : Well if you\u2019re talking about a sequential basis from Q1 to Q2 obviously there is going to be an uptick we expect on the product revenue side. That is a granular build up we do of pipeline and a granular build-up we do of our expectations for the quarter. Obviously the -- what comes in off the balance sheet on the software and hardware components, we know very, very well. So there is a sequential increase on the product revenue side of a sense in Q2 that's reflective of some of that pipeline that started to build up, started to build in the metrics there. It is a pretty significant increase quarter-over-quarter sequentially. So a year from now I will be reminding you of that but that is built on our bottom up projection of the business. Brian Alexander : Do you still expect software and service revenue to grow double-digits on a year-over-year basis in the October quarter? Nick Noviello : I would not. Okay. They come in off the balance sheet I would\u2026 Kris Newton : All right. Thank you, Brian. Brian Alexander : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jayson Noland of Robert Baird. Your line is now open. Again Jayson Noland of Robert Baird. Your line is now open. Kris Newton : All right. Let\u2019s move on to the next caller. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Milunovich of UBS. Your line is now open. Steve Milunovich : Thank you. Could you talk a bit more about the transition to ONTAP 8 from 7? You gave us some percentages that you haven't given before. It sounds like there is a pretty significant shift toward 8, but you didn\u2019t give us any kind of sequential percentages? So was that really accelerating at this point and anyway now it seems to have accelerated obviously the total number has gone down and I guess that plays to your comment about just people transactionally holding back right now. George Kurian : I think at the highest level when we talked about percentages, we talked about the percentages of FAS shipments and we said that the 7-Mode systems were down to 20% to 35% of FAS shipments from 75% year ago and the clustered ONTAP 8 version are up to 65% of FAS shipments from 35% -- from 25% a year ago. So there is a dramatic growth in clustered ONTAP systems as a percentage of our total mix as well as just year-on-year and it represents the value propositions of Clustered ONTAP. Those include shipments being made to new customers, new workloads within existing customers and as we mentioned some early benefit from the transition programs that are under installed base. I would say that on the last bucket meaning the transitions were still very early in that program it seems some good momentum and confidence building within our customers, but hasn\u2019t materially translated into results yet. Steve Milunovich : Thanks. Kris Newton : Thanks Steve. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Louis Miscioscia of CLSA. Your line is now open. Louis Miscioscia : Okay, great. May be I'll go back to Brian\u2019s question, it looks like most of the etcetera week fell into software entitlement and also services. So how much would we expect those to be down on a quarter-to-quarter basis or do you expect them to be flat, which will help us think about how we should also then model in the product revenue? Thank you. Nick Noviello : Yes Lou, I\u2019m not going to get into a granular level of specific there, but really the $40 million of the 14th week was in software and was in the service revenue lines. So it's all there and in fact you can see it on the deferred revenue side of the fence. So deferred revenue was down pretty substantially in Q1 on a year-over-year basis and we haven\u2019t seen that kind of decline really in quite some time. If you take $40 million out of that, which is a deferred component, you get back to a number of that, we\u2019re not thrilled about, but that's a lot closer to those types of sequential decline we\u2019ve seen before. So what we expect to happen is obviously that 14th week doesn\u2019t occur again in Q2. We go back to a 13th week. We won\u2019t talk about 14th week again for six more years from now. So we\u2019re going to look at those pieces. It obviously means that the amount of revenue of $40 million was shared between software and hardware and the share was 18 and 25 respectively that's not going to occur again in Q2. Kris Newton : All right. Thanks Lou. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers of Stifel. Your line is now open. Aaron Rakers : Yes thanks for taking the question. Just on clear and will go back to Brian\u2019s question and I think the prior question as well, at what point does the decline in deferred catch up with the software entitlement maintenance and if you do expect that to decline or not grow the double-digit rate it seems to imply a fairly high teens if not 20% sequential growth in product revenue after the first quarter. So I\u2019m just curious of how we should expect the deferred revenue trends? Should we expect that to grow going forward and what that implies for the product revenue in the first quarter? George Kurian : Okay. So if I think about deferred the software entitlements and service revenue, on a year-over-year basis in Q2, I would expect those things to go up and not going to go up dramatically, they are not going to be reflective of 14th week because there will be no such things. Okay. On the product revenue side and I think the real question is what's going to happen with product revenue? On a sequential basis, we expected a pretty reasonable increase in product revenue. Why is that? That is because at the time we came to the end of Q4 we did not have a pipeline on the product revenue side and we had to rebuild that pipeline. What we're seeing and what we're doing as we build up the guidance for Q2 is that we're going to see some return on the product revenue side and that's reflected in the guidance that we pulled out there. Aaron Rakers : Thank you. George Kurian : Hey, Aaron as you know, we don't guide below the overall revenue line third quarter. Kris Newton : All right. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin of Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is now open. Brent Bracelin : Thank you. George wanted to go back to kind of the decision here to kind of pivot to these modern data architectures. The question is how quickly can you pivot and will that include divestitures or acquisitions and the reason why I ask obviously C-DOT has been years in the making. So help us understand your appetite, how quickly can you pivot here and will that include divestitures or acquisitions? George Kurian : First of all, I think we have a strong portfolio of technologies that are relevant to the modern architectures within our customers. In some cases it is developing core technology. In other cases it is qualifying our technology for emerging used cases within our customers because solutions development. I think that is all well underway and we feel good about the portfolio we have. We're also constantly looking at the evolution of our customers perspective on the IT landscape, their requirements for data management and we'll always be on the lookout for M&A tuck-ins where they make sense have strategic fit, have the right financial criteria associated with them and we have a disciplined way of scanning the landscape and discussing with our customers their choices ahead of them and for us. Kris Newton : All right. Thanks Brent. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Rod Hall : Yes, hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just had one, which is could you give us -- you gave us all the year-over-year trajectory on Clustered ONTAP, but would you be able to give us the proportion of the install base that has adopted it just to give us some idea where we are, where we're tracking? George Kurian : We're as a percentage of our install base, we're about 15% of the total install base and remember the install base is growing and last quarter we were at 11% of the install base. So pretty good sequential growth. Rod Hall : Great. Okay. Thank you, George. Kris Newton : Thanks Rod. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Maynard Um of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Maynard Um : Hi thanks. Nick you talked about next quarter being based on a bottoms-up basis. Can you just talk about how much of that is based on fiscal year government spending or what your expectation is there? And then George if you could just talk about -- you talked about making sure to understand customer mindsets and if they're changing. Wondering if you are seeing any changes within your customer mindsets since you bring that up, thanks? George Kurian : Okay. So Maynard, why don't I just get started. So second quarter is when we generally see the Government, the U.S. Government I should tick in. So our bottom up includes our expectations from the U.S. Fed. It includes our view of contracts that are taking shorter, longer or sideways in terms of the time to land them. As you know we have a very strong presence there and a very good business condition overall and value proposition for them. So the second quarter will include U.S. public sector element to it, a federal fiscal yearend element to it. We plan on all of those. We look at risks or opportunities to those as we build that bottom-up guidance. Nick Noviello : I think to answer your question in terms of the discussions we have with our customers, I've actually had several meetings with customers from all different parts of the world and I am just headed out to Asia Pacific as well. I think the things that encourage me are the breadth of discussions we have and the adoption of multiple products in our portfolio by the enterprise customers that we work with. I think they are expanding the range of things they're doing with us and we're excited and encouraged. Strong growth in terms of the number of customers, enterprises buying multiple products from us for broad set of used cases. Kris Newton : Thanks Maynard. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nehal Chokshi of Maxim Group. Your line is now open. Nehal Chokshi : Thank you. What has been the capsulate of new workload across to market with Clustered ONTAP over the past year. It seems like it\u2019s been depressed and I think you've talked about being refill that pipeline? Is that a fair way of looking at that? George Kurian : I would say that if you were to look at two dimensions of new workloads being captured, I think the first one is new to NetApp customer where clustered Data ONTAP has given us a footprint that we didn\u2019t have before. And as we said in our commentary that has seen strong growth up triple-digits 225%, and so that\u2019s a measure of competitiveness of Clustered ONTAP in net new to NetApp environments. Within existing NetApp customers, the preponderant majority of Clustered ONTAP sales have been to new footprints. As we mentioned the percentage of our installed base that has migrated from their legacy 7-Mode environments to Clustered ONTAP has been small. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks Nehal. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Suva of Citigroup. Your line is now open. Jim Suva : Thank you very much and congratulations both George and Nick. First I've a question for George and a easy clarification for Nick. George you talked about stay tuned to many things you\u2019re looking at for the next quarter, can you help us understand these many things? Are they more operational focused? Are they more capital allocation deployment focused that we might ask is I\u2019m sure you are aware of where your stock price is and your strength of your company? And so one could beg hey why not even buyback more stock, but one could also say maybe we\u2019d spend that more for strategic acquisitions or maybe some different go to market strategy or something like that. So if you can help us understand what\u2019s exactly you're looking for stay tuned. And then for Nick, can you just help us understand you guided for I think was 3 or 3 million in shares, does that include the share count today than what you buyback so far this month or does that also include your estimated stock buyback that you will do after today\u2019s call? George Kurian : So let me answer first the perspective I\u2019m taking is a broad perspective looking at all aspects of the business, both the operating model of the company as well as the opportunity to optimize our capital structure to maximize returns to shareholders. Nick Noviello : Okay. And then my quick clarification on the 303, this is what we\u2019ve done based on the first 10 days of the quarter. So we have not in the past and don't in the future plan to project out what we'll by over the quarter is really based upon first 10 days what happened last quarter and how that falls and depend really just the first 10 days of volume. Kris Newton : Thank you, Jim. Jim Suva : Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi of Lake Street Capital. Your line is now open. Eric Martinuzzi : Thanks. I was hoping you could comment on the international aspects of your business just as you\u2019ve re-built the pipeline exiting Q1 pockets of strength in the international EMEA APAC rest of the world if you could comment that I\u2019ll appreciate it? George Kurian : We\u2019ve had a strong start to the year in the European theater with all of our parts of Europe doing very well year-on-year both especially with FX being accounted for. So that\u2019s a reflection of both the Leadership Team in Europe as well as the value proposition for Clustered ONTAP. Some of the key features that our European customers were waiting for were made available to them in 8.3 and that is now translating into results from the capacity investments as well as the product readiness. Within APAC, we continue to monitor the situation in China. Of course our China business is a small business and hasn\u2019t been affected by the changes in China, but we\u2019re evaluating the impact of the Chinese economy for the rest of the Asia Pacific Theater. Kris Newton : Thanks Eric. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Andrew Nowinski : All right. Thanks you mentioned pretty strong growth out of your genuine pipeline this quarter, just curious of your thoughts regarding the acquisition stock here last night, you're normally competing against one of your largest suppliers DA? George Kurian : The focus for our E series business is on the branded customer business and it is about building pathways to market through our more traditional routes to market resellers, system integrators and service providers. I think we feel good about the progress we\u2019ve made. We think we feel good about the relationships that we have with enterprise and service provider customers who look to buy directly from us or through our reseller model and so we feel that the acquisition does not materially affect that business. Kris Newton : Thanks Andy. Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Srini Nandury of Summit Research. Your line is now open. Srini Nandury : All right. Thank you for taking my call. Congratulations on a good quarter. I had a question on the Clustered ONTAP adoption within your install base. Are they -- when you sell into your install base, are they going to the net new workloads or are they going to your existing workloads? Or in another words are people replacing the old 7-Mode and putting the new boxes in? George Kurian : When we look at that right, so there is sort of two or three sets of used cases within our existing customers. One is competitive displacement or new workload growth. We're certainly seeing a strong set of trajectory around that. The second is replacing 7-Mode for a workload that could have run on 7-Mode, where they choose to go to a new architecture. That certainly happens as part of footprint and then the percentage of those where you have a workload that is running on an old 7-Mode system that now gets essentially upgraded and converted to a Clustered ONTAP system, the last one is a small percentage of the total. Kris Newton : Thanks Srini. Srini Nandury : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And I'll hand the call back over to NetApp for any further remarks. George Kurian : Thank you. I would like to conclude by saying I am excited and honored to lead NetApp through the industry transition. I want to extend my thanks to the entire NetApp team for your hard work and for your support as we create opportunity for NetApp during this transition. We're taking action to better address the trends in the storage market and will manage our portfolio of solutions to target the requirements created by those trends. Our strategy resonates with partners, enterprises and service providers and we're making investments to ensure we're engaging in more customer conversations an opportunities. Those investments are yielding results that position us for a successful future, but we have more work ahead of us. We're committed to enhancing shareholder value and plan to return to our target operating model in the second half of this fiscal year. Our focus on cost structure, stock buyback program and dividends are important demonstrations to this commitment and to our confidence in our future. Thank you all for joining us and I'll talk with you again on our next earnings call with a further update on how we're evolving the business to deliver greater value to customers and shareholders. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes today's program. You may all disconnect. Have a great day everyone.",

George Kurian : Thank you, Kris, and good afternoon everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Our Q2 fiscal year \u201916 financial results were generally as expected. We\u2019ve continued to make progress as we pivot towards growing parts of the market, scale out software-defined flash, converged and hybrid cloud. Our key investment areas of sales capacity, channel traction and acceleration of the transition of our install base to Clustered Data ONTAP continue to show early results. Our focus remained on enabling our customer success as they navigate their IT transformations to leverage modern architectures and deploy hybrid cloud solutions. Over the course of our second quarter, I\u2019ve continued to rigorously analyze our business, I traveled around the world and participated in our Insight user conference, meeting with thousands of customers and partners. The feedback I heard was overwhelmingly positive and reaffirmed my conviction that our Data Fabric strategy resonates with and is aligned to our customer\u2019s strategic technical direction, underpinning our confidence and the opportunity ahead. We\u2019ve made progress but we still have more work to do to become more efficient and agile, so that we can best take advantage of our long term growth opportunity. An increasing uncertain macroeconomic environment, continued shifts in the market and an aggressive pricing environment, have slightly tempered our fiscal year 2016 outlook. By coupling the strength of our Data Fabric strategy and the benefits we deliver to customers, with a more efficient and agile business, we can generate value for customers, partners, employees, and shareholders over time. I have tremendous confidence in our opportunity for success. That said, parts of our business are working well, some parts need improvement and other parts we must manage through declines. The IT spending environment continues to be constrained and the expectation for growth for the overall storage market has decreased to low single-digits. At the same time, customers are seeking to take advantage of new applications and modern data center storage and data management architectures. Based on our analysis, this has resulted in the traditional standalone hybrid storage market declining at approximately 9%, while at the same time, the parts of the market addressed by our scale out, software-defined, flash converged and hybrid cloud solutions are growing at a rate of roughly 20%. Highly disciplined portfolio management is required to address the different growth rates of our markets. We must be more efficient in the parts of our business that aren\u2019t growing in order to generate sufficient profits that can be returned to shareholders and leveraged for investment in areas of growth to deliver innovation ahead of the market. We have already sized our investments in OEM and ONTAP 7-Mode commensurate with the opportunity and I have recently consolidated all of our hardware platform engineering teams into a single group for further efficiency. IT spending will remain under pressure as customers evaluate cloud and modern architectures. We are growing our install base and have made investments in growth areas that are showing results, although they are not yet enough to offset the decline in our traditional business. The decline in standalone hybrid storage most notably impacts our traditional ONTAP 7-Mode business. The 7-Mode storage operating system was shipped on about 30% of FAS units in the quarter, down from roughly 65% a year ago. ONTAP 7-Mode unit shipments were down almost 60% year-over-year and Q2 marked the first time that we did not experience growth in the 7-Mode install base. At a subset of our customers, the normal hardware refresh cycle has been slowed as they plan for the move to clustered ONTAP. We continue to work to smooth this transition for our customers and in our insight user conference last month, we announced the port for ONTAP 7-Mode through 2020. Customers are also slowing investment in the capacity expansion of their traditional 7-Mode storage environment. The dynamics of our 7-Mode and OEM businesses continue to put downward pressure on product revenue, despite strong growth in other parts of our business. As a part of their IT modernization efforts, customers want scale out and software define storage functionality for efficient management of data growth and cloud service provider like flexibility, Clustered ONTAP enabled seamless data management across flash, disc and cloud footprint for enterprise applications like databases, virtualization and ecommerce. The software-defined architecture of Clustered ONTAP provides a consistent way to manage data across public and private cloud regardless of underlying hardware. Clustered ONTAP was deployed on approximately 70% of FAS systems shipped in Q2, up from 35% a year ago and unit shipments of Clustered ONTAP systems grew over 95% year-over-year demonstrating continued strong customer demand. At the beginning of the fiscal year, we created a set of Clustered ONTAP transition program to accelerate the migration of install base customers who are ready to upgrade both their systems and their software from ONTAP 7-Mode to Clustered ONTAP. These programs of customers and certified partners transition support, temporary gear and financial incentives. We saw strong uptake in Q2, almost all of which was done with the tremendous support of our channel partners, while these programs helped migration ready customers move, migrations themselves are projects that must fit within the overall IT priorities and budgets of our customers. The low growth of overall IT spending has an impact on the pace of migration. As we have stated before, we anticipate that the transition of the install base will happen over the course of year. The Clustered ONTAP install base continues to grow and now represents 17% of total install FAS system and almost 30% of installed FAS capacity. The number of customers who purchase Clustered ONTAP systems in Q2 grew by 85% from Q2 last year. And in that same period, the number of new to NetApp customers who purchased Clustered ONTAP in Q2 grew by 95%. Customers are deploying high performance flash technology to gain advantages from accelerating business transactions, processes and their supporting enterprise applications. Our all flash FAS products offer enterprise grade flash technology combining built-in data protection, multi-protocol support, scale out performance and seamless data movement from flash to disk to cloud. After introducing flash essentials, with optimized read performance, in line compression and in line zero based deduplication in Q1. We improved both the list price and form factor for our All Flash FAS by 40% as well as announced a controller upgrade program, a seven year extended warranty and a 3x performance guarantee. These enhancements garnered positive feedback in the channel and drove rapid adoption of our All Flash FAS products with unit shipments accelerating 445% year-over-year, the sixth consecutive quarter of triple digit growth. To meet the requirements of ultra high performance, low latency application, customers opt for our ES product. Units of the ES series grew 65% from Q2 a year ago. In order to achieve the performance, availability and cost requirements of new web scale and analytic applications like Hadoop and Splunk, and the increase in the amount of data retained on line for business insight and cyber security, customers are deploying our E Series platform. For customers who are increasing their cyber security defenses with real time analysis the E Series capability to store hot and cold data under the same data management architecture substantially improved the efficiency and flexibility of their environment. We are aggressively targeting this part of the market and continue to see growth of the E Series with unit shipments up over 20% from Q2 last year. Our hybrid cloud solution comprised NetApp private storage for clouds, cloud ONTAP, StorageGRID Webscale and AltaVault. While these solutions do not contribute materially to revenue today, they are important in positioning us for leading edge hybrid cloud deployment. A large European manufacturing company chose NetApp for our cloud integration, coupled with converged and All Flash solutions and the ability to manage it all under a single framework in Clustered ONTAP. Similarly we had wins at a global law firm. A large global security vendor, a US based software management company and many others because of our ability to deliver highly competitive storage solutions and have a broader strategic discussion encompassing cloud ready integration and enablement with the world's leading cloud service providers. This is the power of the data fabric at work. For customers looking for preintegrated converged solutions NetApp offers FlexPod in conjunction with Cisco. NetApp and Cisco introduced FlexPod five years ago and have generated 5.6 billion in shared revenue delivered by more than 1,100 partners to more than 6,300 customers worldwide. In Q2 we announced a Cisco validated design for All Flash FAS FlexPod with Cisco's application centric infrastructure ACI. You will continue to see exciting innovations from our strong partnership with Cisco. Our customers are transforming themselves using digital technology, connected with pervasive broadband network and cloud computing to improve the efficiency of their businesses, build global business systems and better serve their customers. Data is at the heart of that transformation. At the same time they are scrutinizing the value that they have gained from past investments in IT, reducing IT budgets and rethinking how they consume IT. This evaluation is creating caution on traditional storage system transactional spending and is diverting spending towards transformational projects and modern architectures like scale out, software-defined, flash, converged and hybrid cloud, where our data fabric strategy gives us an advantage over the competition.  NetApp is the only company that can help customers manage their data seamlessly across multiple cloud architectures, and provide the scale and modern architectures needed to accommodate the exponential data growth of the digital era. NetApp is changing to position the company for long term growth. We expect to gain share in the traditional part of the market but that alone won't be sufficient to overcome the decline of that market and drive overall growth for NetApp. We will continue our pivot towards modern architectures such as scale out, software-defined, flash, converged and hybrid cloud. The growth in this part of our business is strong and encouraging. Customer and partner feedback drives strong conviction that our industry leading portfolio and differentiated data fabric strategy will expand our opportunity and drive long term growth. However this transition will take time as the growth is coming off a smaller base than our traditional ONTAP 7-Mode footprint. We are investing to accelerate growth and are taking action on the cost structure of the business to ensure value creation for customers and shareholders through the duration of this transition. In fact we're conducting a fundamental assessment of every aspect of our business structure, portfolio and process to reduce complexity and drive the efficiency while improving our velocity and investing for long-term growth. This will require making some important decisions about topics crucial to our business from our product portfolio to our go-to-market approach and our supporting functions. We must both invest for the long-term growth of our business and preserve our current growth initiatives that are showing early results while streamlining and improving the efficiency of our business. We will lower the cost structure of the Company but will not take actions that improve our short-term results at the expense of our long-term strength. There is growth to be had in this industry and we believe we have the right strategy and technology to capture that growth in the long-term and deliver increased shareholder value overtime. NetApp has the innovation, scale, and open ecosystem needed to solve the data management challenges for the enterprise. The changes to larger players in the market create opportunity for us. NetApp is the only company able to span flash to disk to cloud and the only company delivering the ability to manage data across multiple clouds and on premises today. Many elements of our portfolio are growing strongly and we need to capitalize on them by maintaining our sales capacity, continuing our channel efforts and making it easier for our installed based to migrated Clustered ONTAP. Customer wins and partner feedback indicate that we\u2019re on the right path. We have a portfolio of differentiated IT and a growing install base, we are delivering tremendous value to customers in their strategic IT transformation, it is critical that we build a stronger more efficient company that solves customer challenges while delivering profitability and earnings growth in a moderated IT spending and storage market. You can expect tangible results from this process over the remainder of this fiscal year and beyond. Before turning the call over to Nick, I would like to thank the entire NetApp team for their hard work and dedication as we evolve our great company for future growth and sustained success. And I would like to extend a special thank you to Rob Salmon, President, who after 22 years announced his intent to retire from NetApp at the end of the fiscal year. We appreciate all he has done for the Company and his work to ensure a smooth transition. I'll now turn it over to Nick. Nick Noviello : Thank you, George, good afternoon everyone. Before we get started as a reminder I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers in today's discussion unless otherwise indicated. Overall, we are pleased with our Q2 financial results and the progress we're making related to our key investments, in sales capacity, in the channel and in accelerating the migration to Clustered ONTAP. Starting with revenues, net revenues for the second quarter were $1.45 billion, up about 8% sequentially and down 6% year-over-year. FX headwinds had an unfavorable impact on the year-over-year comparison by about 4 point. As George indicated, the overall IT spending environment is pressured, this coupled with the uncertain macroeconomic environment has affected us in different ways across our geographies. For example our U.S. public sector business declined 22% year-over-year in Q2 while at the same time excluding impacts from foreign exchange, EMEA and Asia-Pacific were up 8% and 3% year-over-year respectively. Product revenue of $815 million was up 23% sequentially in line with expectations but was down 12% year-over-year. The year-over-year decline reflects favorable Clustered ONTAP momentum which was more than offset by about 5 points of FX headwinds and declines in ONTAP 7-Mode revenue which we expected as well as OEM revenue due to the changing business dynamics of our OEM customers. The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenues primarily derived from existing new and renewed service contracts was up 3% year-over-year but down 6% sequentially, reflecting the return to a 13 week quarter. As a reminder, we had an extra week in Q1 which resulted in about a $40 million increase to Q1 maintenance revenue. Indirect revenue accounted for 77% of net revenues similar to Q1. Gross margin of 62.5% was down about 2.5 point year-over-year and about a half a point below our prior guidance range. FX headwinds had an unfavorable impact of about 1 point year-over-year. Product gross margin of 51.8% was up about 0.5 of a point sequentially and was down about 6.5 points year-over-year, driven by about 2.5 points of FX and roughly equal impacts from higher discounting and unfavorable product mix. On the year-over-year basis, software maintenance gross margin was roughly flat while hardware maintenance and other services gross margin was up 2 points reflecting a favorable mix shift towards hardware maintenance as well as infrastructure cost efficiencies. Q2 operating expenses totaled $684 million and were down 8% quarter-over-quarter and 6% year-over-year. This sequential decline reflects a combination of a return to a 13 week quarter and prudent expense management. Operating margin for the second quarter of 15.2% was 7.5 points higher than last quarter and was just above our previous guidance range. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 17% as expected. Weighted average diluted share count of 296 million shares decreased by approximately 12 million shares sequentially and 8% year-over-year due to share repurchase activity. Q2 EPS $0.61 was a penny above the high end of our prior guidance range. Now turning to cash and balance sheet metrics, we closed Q2 with $4.8 billion in cash and short-term investments, 14% of which was held by our domestic entities. Deferred and financed unearned services revenue decreased by $20 million in Q2 versus Q1 and was flat year-over-year. Inventory turns increased to 17 in line with our expectations and days sales outstanding normalized to 37 days from 30 days in Q1 reflecting the return to a 13 week quarter. Q2 cash flow from operations was approximately $145 million versus $381 million in Q2 a year ago. Free cash flow of $99 million was about 7% of net revenues, down substantially from Q2 a year ago due to lower net income and the return to normal levels of DSO and accrued compensation, net of improved inventory turns related to the 14th week in Q1. Finally, we repurchased approximately $183 million of stock and paid $53 million in cash dividends during the quarter. Consistent with our previous guidance we remain on track to complete our share repurchase program by the end of May 2018 with the first $1 billion [ph] of repurchases expected to be completed by the end of May 2016. Today we also announced our next cash dividends of $0.18 per share of the company\u2019s stock that will be paid on January 20, 2016. Now turning to our business outlook, we remain confident in our strategy and long-term growth potential. As I discussed last quarter fiscal year 2016 is one of transition. We are realizing results from our investments in sales capacity, actions to regain traction in the channel and programs to accelerate the migration to Clustered ONTAP. Coming into the year we anticipated that top-line predictability would improve in the back half but the uncertain macroeconomic environment continued shifts in our market, and an aggressive pricing environment have resulted in continued limited visibility. While we have made progress in rebuilding our pipeline, these factors have slightly tempered our outlook. As a result, we expect revenue for fiscal 2016 to be down just over 5%. Though ultimately dependent on revenue mix, growth and our continued actions to drive down costs, given the environment we now estimate fiscal 2016 gross margin to be down 1 to 2 points from fiscal 2015 and operating margin to be down about 2 points for the year. We expect second half operating margin of approximately 18% the low end of our target operating margin range. Although off to a slow start in the first half we expect free cash flow as a percentage of revenue for the second half of the year to be in the mid-teens. Finally we expect to reduce share count in fiscal 2016 by approximately 6% and between dividends and share repurchases we will again return over 100% of free cash flow generated in the fiscal year to shareholders. As George discussed we are assessing every aspect of our business to drive efficiency and velocity. We will lower our cost structure including cost reduction actions in the second half of fiscal 2016 we will drive greater efficiency across the business and at the same time make investments in growth areas leading to increased profitability longer term growth and increased shareholder value. For Q3 we expect net revenues to range between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion which at the midpoint implies flat revenues versus Q2 and a 7% decrease year-over-year. We expect Q3 consolidated gross margin of approximately 61.5% and operating margin of approximately 17%. Based on our share repurchases in Q2 and in the first 10 days of Q3 we expect our weighted average diluted share count for the quarter to be approximately 297 million shares and earnings per share for Q2 to range from approximately $0.66 to $0.71 per share. In summary we are confident in the opportunity ahead of us. Customer wins and feedback from partners indicate that our data fabric strategy is differentiated and well aligned with their most critical IT imperatives. We must improve our efficiency and agility to take full advantage of those opportunities and to set NetApp on a path for increased profitability, long-term growth and increased shareholder value. I will now turn the call back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris? Kris Newton : Thanks Nick. We\u2019ll now open the call for Q&A. Please be respectful of your peers, and limit yourself to one question, so that we can get to as many people as possible. Thanks for your cooperation, operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jayson Noland of Robert Baird. Your line is open. Jayson Noland : I wanted to ask George on the transition program. Could you provide some more detail on the economic incentives that are behind cTAP and then how are the credits accounts for on the P&L? George Kurian : The credits are essentially discounts related to the product bookings that were registered as part of that program. So every transaction that is qualified for the cTAP incentives goes through a deal registration process that we administer. In terms of the program itself, the incentives and enablement that we have conducted include the availability of temporary swing gear on a loan basis to customers that need temporary capacity, some set of incentives around professional services to help them enumerate the cost of the overall migration effort. A majority of the transitions have being done through the partners and there have been strong update and good feedback from the partners in the second quarter of this year, the number of partners that participated in the Clustered ONTAP acceleration program expanded substantially from Q1 across all of the geographies in the world, as well as the number of customer transactions also expanded substantially from Q1. So we\u2019re pleased with progress. We thank our partners for leading in with us on this important effort. Operator : Our next question is from Jim Suva of Citi. Your line is open. Jim Suva : George can you give us a little bit more color on -- you had mentioned that you\u2019re doing the strategic reviews and a lot of the efficiencies and stuff like that. Is there anything we can judge or put as milestones or look ahead and see how quickly you\u2019re assessing these items? And then for Nick, can you talk a little bit about cash flow, whether it\u2019d be an extra week last quarter, and not the extra week this quarter. If you sum up the two quarters in total, you kind of in my view washes out the extra week factor. And when you look at the two quarters together, the cash flow looks down significantly year-over-year. Is that kind of the new run rate we\u2019re looking at for cash flows as a percent of revenues? Or how should we think about cash flows, because it seems like it\u2019s directionally stepped back a little bit? Thank you. George Kurian : I\u2019ll take the first question and then hand over to Nick. I\u2019d appreciate the next few callers to just stick with your question. In terms of the overall assessments that we have conducted, it\u2019s really focused on both efficiency as well as velocity. And what I mean by that is efficiency around all aspects of our business, structure, portfolio, business process, so that customers find it easier to do business with us as well as partners. In terms of velocity, we feel that having accomplished the efficiency aspects of the program, we will be able to transition our business more quickly in response to changing market landscapes. We\u2019ll just be a leaner, more efficient Company that can be more agile in response to the changing market environment. You will hear more from me over the second half of this fiscal year and over the next few quarters beyond that as we go through the program. Stay tuned it is a fundamental reassessment of all aspects of our Company. Nick Noviello : And Jim just quickly, with respect to the cash flow, I think this is consistent with the slow start up of the year right. The first half was intended to be a rebuild, both of the pipeline and a rebuild of the business condition. You saw that in terms of even the operating margins as we grew up in the first half year. You can see it in net income. Second point would be that as we look at the second half, our view is that we\u2019re going to be in the mid-teens in terms of cash flow as a percentage of revenue in the second half. So, that clearly washes out all of the implications of timing, 13-week versus the 14-week quarter and all of those pieces. Operator : Our next question is from Lou Miscioscia of CLSA. Your line is open. Lou Miscioscia : When you look at your operating franchise, sales, marketing, R&D, G&A, you did a good job year-over-year, and obviously quarter-over-quarter taking out the prior week. Should we expect it to more or less stay flat absolute at this level going forward? And then if you could comment where do you think it could go even more into the future into \u201917 and beyond? Because it sounds like you want to continue to take a good cost out, or take cost out? Nick Noviello : Hi Lou this is Nick, so a couple of things. I think if you back through the guidance, you will see an implied reduction quarter-over-quarter, so a sequential between Q2 and Q3 reduction in operating expenses overall. Also it\u2019d say that 47% of revenue in Q2 is not the type of level we expect for the business, in the long-term, or in the long-term models. So, more to come, and we\u2019ll talk more about that, George indicated that he\u2019d spend more time talking about the portfolio and all of the things we\u2019re looking at, but suffice it to say for purposes of the Q3 guide you can back through that and see that we expect operating expense to be down sequentially and down even as a percentage of revenue versus Q2. Operator : Our next question is from Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Kulbinder Garcha : And a question for both of you I guess on gross margins on the product side, and it\u2019s under pressure this year we are seeing currently but they kind of feel almost permanent and the currencies are where they are and then on top of that pricing seems intense. There is always kind of intense in this industry and you're going through a prolonged transition which I assume opens you to more competitive attack. So would I be wise in concluding that this level of gross margin is probably all we\u2019re going to see for some time or are there some of the drivers or initiatives that work to bring them back to historic level? Thanks. Nick Noviello : Sure, Kulbinder let me start with that, so certainly if you look at the gross margins and specifically the product gross margins for the quarter on a year-over-year basis we have a 2.5 point impact alone from foreign exchange, we don\u2019t expect that type of thing and in fact that will start to mitigate as we get certainly to Q4. We do have higher discounting, I made that clear. Last quarter and actually in Q4 I talked about higher discounting, it's about two points impact on a year-over-year basis to product gross margin this quarter that we have to work through, that is the aggressive pricing actions going on in the industry right now, we have to look it. That said, overtime we\u2019ve shown that we can move margins here and in fact over a several years we did exactly that. Finally, I would say that on the services side of our business the team has done a really good job in terms of leveraging the cost base and servicing the enormous install base of customers that we have. So I think it's a combination of items certainly the aggressive pricing environment it is something that we have to be reflective of, the portfolio is something we spend a lot of time working on and thinking about and the uptake of Clustered ONTAP with customers and those actions on the hybrid cloud portfolio overtime we expect to see benefits to margins of the Company. Operator : Our next question is from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Sherri Scribner : I was hoping if you can give us a little bit of geographic detail in terms of what you saw across the world, it looks like the Asia business saw some nice uptick in the quarter just curious what that\u2019s about? And looks like maybe the public business was maybe a bit softer, so hoping to get some more detail? Thanks. Nick Noviello : Okay Sherri, let me just start on that for a second, so if I take the impact of currency out our EMEA business actually did really well in the quarter and that EMEA business year-over-year without currency was up 8%, Asia was up 3. The challenge obviously was in the U.S. public sector down 22, no foreign currency impact there. I think that to start and I am sure George may have a comment or two as well, I think the EMEA team has done an incredible job really over the course I am going to say no of this last year plus of taking Clustered Data ONTAP and the promise of the portfolio and the data fabric and bringing that to customers, I think it started there. And Asia, we obviously had some very strong areas, we have some that are more challenged and we have some macroeconomic implications in Asia that we\u2019re just going to have to work through and the team there is working through it. In the U.S. public sector, there is a variety of things going on that we just have to be aware of. I would say that we are not anticipating a recovery in the U.S. public sector as we move into Q3. George Kurian : Just to add some color to that, I think when I look across the geographies our large enterprise customers continue to do good business with us across all the geographies. To add some color to the Asia-Pac and public sector comments, in Asia Pac you certainly saw the impact of the slowdown of China, in the countries that were dependent on China either for investment or as suppliers to the Chinese economy. So it was while the overall business met expectations there was a wide range of different countries. I think in terms of the public sector itself. We do large amount of business through the global system integrators and their business was challenged within the public sector model. We also saw in some cases program delays or prioritization of spend towards priority such as cyber security. We feel confident of our position in the public sector business, we are the number one provider of storage and data management and we continue to win our preponderant majority of new opportunities within the public sector. Operator : Our next question is from Ananda Baruah of Brean Capital. Your line is open. Ananda Baruah : This could be for either, George or for Nick just what I guess anecdotally is the right way to think about the levers around the R&D it certainly seemed to be just if you take a look at this quarter one of the contributors to the OpEx, the OpEx I would say kind of catalytic performance. But it just seems like this year is going to be a little bit softer than last year and in the context of I may have to give specifics now, but like looking at the overall portfolio is there anything that you can tell us now philosophically how you're looking about the -- looking at the R&D going forward given that we've already seen it come off a little bit? Thanks. George Kurian : When we look at portfolio management we look at it on both products and product market as well as customer segments, geographies and all aspects of the business. As I said in my prepared remarks we run a very disciplined portfolio management process which means that for capabilities that are mature in the market we continue to reduce our investments in those parts of the business whether they are pathways, whether they are customer segments or on the product portfolio side and reinvest some of that into the faster growing emerging parts of the market. We returned some of that certainly to shareholders and some of that we reinvest to the faster growing parts of the market, so that's our portfolio management approach and we've implemented it, it's certainly part of the model that you're seeing being implemented in the Company going forward and that's what's driving discipline in the operating expense stack. Operator : Our next question is from Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Market, your line is open. Amit Daryanani : I guess George I just want to understand this cost containment side you talked expectation last earnings call that we would have more update this time around. So I'm curious what are you seeing and what's driving this announcement of cost optimization to be more further pushed out and then broadly as you think of your business if you have a zero to down 5% revenue trajectory what do you think the right OpEx number is, is it sort of 20% or 40% for you guys? Thank you. George Kurian : We have done a thorough analysis of the business and identified a number of areas to drive fundamental transformation that fundamental transformation is both to improve the efficiency of the business and also make it easier to do business with NetApp. To do those actions will take time to achieve the full desired outcome, but it is what will help the Company both transform our operating expense stack, as well as make it easier to do business with us so that we can drive top-line velocity. The things that we have done are already showing results in the quarter so we have taken some action in the quarter and we said we will take further actions through the second half of the year and you will see more progress updates as we take those actions on. So we are not saying that we're pushing out any action to next fiscal year. We're going to start and we're going to continue to do it over multiple quarters. Operator : Our next question is from Brian White of Drexel. Your line is open. Brian White : I'm wondering if you could give us a little color on how you're thinking about the Dell EMC deal and the opportunities that they open up or the threats that you see from this transaction. Thank you. George Kurian : First of all I would say that my opening comment is that the Dell EMC transaction is yesterday's solution to tomorrow's customers' problems. It does not fundamentally address the hybrid cloud, it does not fundamentally address the data management opportunity that customers are forced to deal with. It is really about trying to build efficiency in an integrated hardware business rather than the software-defined data center of the future. I think in the near-term based on discussions with multiple customers and partners it is generating a lot of uncertainties for customers and resellers and that is clearly an opportunity for NetApp, which we intend to take advantage of. In the long-term the absence of a compelling story around the ITR section of the future will make their customer value propositions something that we can debate and capitalize on. We are taking action to improve the efficiency of our business to be able to deal with larger scale competitors and be more agile than they are. And I'll summarize at that. Operator : Our next question is from Maynard Um of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Maynard Um : George you talk about portfolio management but it sounds more like you're looking for areas that de-emphasis in declining products. You obviously have a pretty strong customer install base even in large enterprises, so I'm curious why you wouldn't look to more aggressively broaden out your portfolio to cross sell more products into your existing install base and then across your broad channel. And I know you've done acquisitions like buying Riverbed's SteelStore product but why not have a more aggressive product acquisition strategy maybe even larger to increase your revenue per customer rather than returning the cash to shareholders and I guess the question really boils down to NetApp being either a growth versus value company and which one you think is right for the Company long-term? Thanks. George Kurian : I would tell you that we are in a changing market landscape where some parts of the market are declining and some parts of the market are growing quickly. I would say that it is important for us from a management perspective to apply discipline and maturely harvest the categories of the market that are declining. We do believe that we can continue to gain share even in those declining markets. At the same time we balance every dollar that we have incremental in terms of investing in new market opportunities or returning it to shareholders and that's a careful balance that we continue to have. In terms of our emerging portfolio of products as I said on the call, we are very pleased with the progress in terms of the growth rates of the emerging portfolio the all-flash arrays, the E series portfolio, the hybrid cloud solutions we're very pleased with the progress both in terms of the growth rates as well as the number of channel partners selling it, as well as the number of customers that are adopting multiple products from NetApp to the point you just made. So we will continue to stay disciplined. We have a disciplined market and strategic evaluation process that looks at our portfolio and compares it to the market trends and it's an ongoing evolution in a changing market, so thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Steve Milunovich of UBS. Your line is open. Steve Milunovich : You talked about the Company in two pieces standalone storage and on the other side scale out software-defined in cloud, what percentage of the Company is in each bucket today and what do you expect maybe exiting the year in a couple of quarters? George Kurian : Obviously, when we talked about traditional standalone storage systems we were talking about our 7-Mode operating system and the OEM business. I think when you look at the used cases for the E series through the branded channel there are a large number of third platform used cases that are built around the data center of the future. The Clustered ONTAP operating system is also part of the datacenter of the future combining scale out, software-defined and all-flash architectures to enable customers to operate their environments like cloud service providers. So traditional storage we were referring to were particularly around 7-Mode and OEM. Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Nowinski of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Andrew Nowinski : So I just like to ask about linearity in the quarter, I know you said product revenue was down 12% year-over-year, product gross margin was down I think impart due to higher discounting, but then your DSO was also spiked up which seems to imply the quarter maybe have been a little backend loaded and your guidance for the January quarter was a bit lower than street was expecting, so I guess when you look at both your metrics together it seems like you may have pulled in revenue into October quarter, so just wondering if you could provide any color on that dynamic and whether the sales pipeline for the January quarter is up on a year-over-year basis? Nick Noviello : Andrew it's Nick. Let me get you started on that part of the first half activity as we talked about it back in May and then again in August on our calls was to rebuild pipeline, and the team has been doing a really important effort around just that, putting sales capacity and rebuilding channel partner relationship et cetera. So I think the work continues to go on there, that's not something that's going end, it's going to be something that continues. In terms of linearity in the quarter, the second quarter is a quarter that encompasses both the federal year-end in September and then our quarter end in October. When I look at our position at the end of the quarter, end of the quarter versus the sort of the end of the quarter a year ago is not much different there. So the linearity, I think is pretty normal in terms of overall what has happened year-on-year, I realize the pieces there is anomalies, I should say there are anomalies in this 14 week quarter from Q1 which we see every six years. So, hopefully, we will not have that type of thing talk about for another six years, but other than that the linearity is really consistent with what we expected and our position going into Q3 consistent with what we had going into Q3 even last year. Operator : Our next question is from Rod Hall of JPMorgan. Your line is open. Rod Hall : George I guess I wanted to ask about the penetration CDOT you said it was 17% I think in this quarter, that's a little bit of a slowdown in penetration rate from the last quarter, so wanted to just get you to comment on that, you're talking about a pretty high transaction rate there so just trying to proposal of two things? And then also on that same line you said 30% of capacity is penetrated, can you guys give us the last two quarters of that number so we can compare that capacity penetration rate? Thanks. George Kurian : So let me just say that our prior quarter was at 15% and the current quarter is at 17%. So we're not -- we don't see this as a slowdown, we see this as a constant sort of trajectory of customer environments transitioning from 7 to CDOT as well as new shipments getting deployed in our install base. When a new shipment gets sold by NetApp to the customer, it usually takes a little while before it actually shows up in our install based measuring system because of the time it takes for the customer to get it ready and deploy it. So sometimes the quarter boundary is not the perfect answer and so we see this as part of our ongoing trajectory. In terms of capacity deployed and capacity managed, we don't breakout those numbers they are essentially a measurement of the valuable of Clustered Data ONTAP in terms of being able to consolidate multiple systems and provide for large-scale data management in a very efficient fashion for customers, so we are pleased with that statistic as well. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Alexander of Raymond James. Your line is open. Brian Alexander : Just going back to the geographic performance why do you suppose Europe has been so strong in the last couple of quarters, I think you said up 8% in constant currency, the macro backdrop at Europe obviously isn\u2019t all that favorable. So what\u2019s different about your business or your competitive position there that\u2019s allowing you to have a pretty strong growth in constant currency versus the performance in the Americas? George Kurian : I would say there is two or three factors. The first is I want to thank our European sales leadership team. We have a deep experienced, well executing sales leadership team and a group of loyal channel partnerships who we have enabled with our technology sets and that has driven consistency in terms of the execution of the European organization. It is also translating our investments in the channel as well as the capacity investments we have made in the field into results. The second is we have introduced capabilities that were specific to the European market. So for example Clustered Data ONTAP there is a high availability configuration of it called Metro Cluster that is built for European, with European datacenters in mind and that gives us a far superior solution for Europe than any other competitor in the market. So it\u2019s both technology as well as great execution on the ground. Operator : Our next question is from Aaron Rakers of Stifel. Your line is open. Aaron Rakers : I wanted to go and discuss the free cash flow guidance I believe last quarter you had talked about 15% free cash flow relative to revenue, I know that you\u2019ve tampered slightly your revenue outlook for this fiscal year but now you are talking about 15% for the back half of the year which by my math would adjust a deepened decline in the full year free cash flow contribution. I am just kind of wondering what necessarily has changed so significantly in the free cash flow expectation relative to the slight write-down on the income statement. George Kurian : Yes, Aaron, actually if you go back to some of the discussion that actually happened in May we are talking about a cash from ops for the year that was going to be coming in, in let\u2019s say the high 100 million range if you backed through the math and then redeploying to shareholders over 1 billion so over 100% redeployed to shareholders. When I look at our forecast today they are moderately south of that but we are not talking about material numbers. So it is mid-teens is the expectation for the second half of the year. There has obviously been some pressure here in the first half, there has been some noise in terms of Q1 versus Q2 but overall for the year we should be generating a cash from ops range in the $800 million to $900 million range and that is not that significantly different from what we even talked about back in May. Operator : Thank you. Our last question is from Joe Wittine of Longbow Research. Your line is open. Joe Wittine : George I think I want to appreciate the pragmatic view on market growth splitting out kind of the traditional on prem areas that are shrinking, I think you said 9% of the growth the portions converged all-flash et cetera are growing 20%. Give us a sense of what is NetApp\u2019s current breakdown I think it just helps in believe the story it helps kind of helps us to do the math as far as when top-line growth could return? Thanks. George Kurian : I would say that first of all it\u2019s hard for us to breakout specific segments because essentially our all-flash arrays are part of our core Clustered Data ONTAP business. I would point you in terms of the places where the business is declining to 7-Mode and our OEM business as we said the 7-Mode business is down to 30% of new shipments down from a much, much larger number a year before, Clustered Data ONTAP is 70% of new shipments and so you can draw your conclusions in terms of when that transition will happen. The majority of our business has already transitioned to the go forward platform. I will leave you with that. The majority of our business has already transitioned to the go forward platforms in the E series branded versus OEM in the ONTAP and FAS business Clustered ONTAP versus 7-Mode. Kris Newton : Thanks Joe. I\u2019ll give it back to George for a couple of summary comments. George Kurian : Thank you for joining us today. I would like to conclude by saying we continue to make progress as we pivot towards growing parts of the market. Scale out, software-defined, flash, converged and hybrid could. Our key investment areas is sales capacity, channel traction and the acceleration of the transition of our install base to Clustered ONTAP are showing early results. Clustered ONTAP, flash and other emerging pieces of our portfolio are growing strongly although not yet to enough to offset the decline in our ONTAP 7-Mode business. Our customers are transforming themselves using digital technology connected with pervasive broadband networks and cloud computing to improve the efficiency of their business, their global business systems and better serve their customers. Data is at the heart of that transformation and where NetApp has a unique and valuable role to play. Feedback from customers and partners is overwhelmingly positive and reaffirms my strong conviction that our data fabric strategy is aligned to our customers\u2019 strategic technical direction for IT. NetApp is the only Company that can help enterprises manage their data seamlessly across multiple cloud architectures with the scale and modern system architectures needed to accommodate the exponential data growth of the digital era. NetApp is changing to position the Company for long-term growth. We are conducting a fundamental assessment of every aspect of our business, structure, portfolio and process, to reduce complexity and drive efficiency, while improving our overall velocity. We will build a stronger more efficient Company that solves customer challenges, while delivering profitability and earnings growth in a moderated IT spending and storage market. Thanks for joining us and I\u2019ll speak with you again next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kris Newton : Hello, and thank you for joining us on our Q3 fiscal year 2016 earnings call. With me today are CEO, George Kurian; and Interim CFO, Jeff Bergmann. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com along with the earnings release, our financial tables and guidance, a historical supplemental data table and a non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation. As a reminder, during today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2016 and for fiscal year 2017, our expectations regarding future revenue growth, improved profitability, cash flow, effective tax rate and shareholder returns, our expectations about our ability to drive operational and financial performance and about the impact of the SolidFire acquisition and business, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. Such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and are being made as of today. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons, including the macroeconomic environment, the overall growth rates for IT, our ability to successfully pivot to the growth areas of the market, our ability to expand our operating margin, our ability to reduce our cost structure within the planned timeframe and our ability to continue our capital allocation strategy and investment in strategic opportunities. Please also refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC, specifically our most recent Forms 10-Q, our Form 10-K for fiscal year 2015 and our current reports on Form 8-K, all of which can also be found on our website. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. I'll now turn the call over to George. George Kurian : Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Our Q3 performance reflects our strong focus on operational execution as well as continued challenges from a number of headwinds. For the quarter we achieved our margin and EPS targets. However, we recorded lower than expected revenue. These mixed results reflect the impact of an uncertain and volatile macroeconomic environment, which is causing a slowdown in spending that became more evident in January. Additionally, overall growth rates for enterprise IT remain under pressure, as customers shift some of their spending to the cloud. Despite these headwinds, we had a number of positives in the quarter. Our data fabric strategy and pivot towards the growth segments of the market, scale-out, software-defined, flash, converged and hybrid cloud continue to yield positive results. Earlier this month we closed the SolidFire acquisition, positioning us to lead the rapidly growing All Flash array market. Before I go into greater depth on the progress we've made in these areas, I want to spend time on the fundamental changes we are undertaking to return NetApp to revenue growth with improved profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns. On prior calls I told you that I was driving a detailed inspection of the business. I have now concluded that formal review. Parts of our business are working well and growing, but we are managing through declines in other parts. We have many exciting innovative industry-leading products, strong relationships with customers and partners and a large growing installed base. NetApp does not need to completely reinvent itself, but we do need to execute comprehensive and sustained transformation to deliver on our commitment to return to revenue growth and enhanced profitability and shareholder returns. We will take significant steps to streamline the business and further advance our pivot to the growth areas of the market in order to capture the full potential of NetApp. To accomplish this we've adopted a plan with several key priorities. First, we have focused on the strategic solutions that represent our pivot to the growth segments of the market and are the foundation of how we enable customer success in the data-powered digital era. Second, we are substantially reducing cost and systematically streamlining the business, even while investing for the future. Third, we will provide greater visibility into the business and our revenue mix to demonstrate why we are so confident in our ability to capitalize on our strategic solutions. And fourth, we remain committed to our capital allocation strategy, which includes a combination of share repurchases, dividends and investing for the long-term growth of the business. Let's start with our strategic solutions. As a baseline, our focus remains in enabling our customer success, as they navigate through their own IT transmissions, which leverage modern architectures and hybrid cloud solutions. Clustered ONTAP, branded E-Series, All Flash arrays, hybrid cloud solutions and OnCommand Insight are the set of strategic solutions that are the basis of our pivot to the growth segments of the market. The growth rate of our strategic solutions is strong, but as I have discussed, not yet sufficient to offset the headwinds from the mature areas of our business, OEM, ONTAP 7-Mode and add-on. We expect that these headwinds will lessen, as we progress through fiscal year 2017. As we emerge from FY '17, the transition to clustered ONTAP should be mostly behind us, as will the downward pressure that the transition has put on our add-on storage business. As OEM and ONTAP 7-Mode become a smaller part of our mix, we anticipate that our pivot towards the growth areas of the market will return the company to revenue growth albeit moderated. During this transition period, we will maintain a sharp focus and execution, reduce our cost base and take additional steps to manage the trends in the storage industry. We will make transformational moves to become more focused, efficient and effective, while fundamentally lowering the cost structure of the company even as we invest in strategic opportunities, which brings us to our second priority, cost control. We will utilize disciplined portfolio management to improve productivity and better align resources with opportunities, while simultaneously maximizing returns from the mature portions of our business. We must also streamline the business to increase our effectiveness and flexibility in responding to the rapidly changing market. All of this will expand operating margin. We have launched a comprehensive program to reduce the cost base of our business by $400 million gross annually with run rate savings achieved by the end of fiscal year '17. We have already embarked on this initiative. We have made decisions that streamline our business, such as consolidating our hardware engineering and manufacturing operations teams, implementing tighter controls on indirect spending and improving supply chain efficiency. These actions and lower variable compensation enabled us to lower our Q3 operating expenses by 8% sequentially. Today we announced our restructuring and reduction in workforce of approximately 12% of total headcount. This action will generate annualized run rate savings of approximately $200 million against our gross target. We expect the majority of this workforce reduction to occur in fiscal Q4. As these cost efficiencies materialize, we are reinvesting some of these savings into strategic solutions like SolidFire and productivity improvements, which will allow us to be more effective at a lower cost structure, yielding a net run rate savings of roughly $130 million by the end of fiscal year '17. We are taking a thoughtful approach to the reductions, employing disciplined portfolio management and fundamentally changing the way we operate. Savings will be achieved through business transformation, including operational process redesign, organizational restructuring and realignment and further portfolio streamlining. We are also putting into place controls to ensure that these savings are sustained. These transformational moves will better align our resources against the strategic opportunity and our cost structure to the near-term growth trajectory of the business. While we've been working to make our model more efficient for some time now, this comprehensive and sustained transformation will enable us to realize the benefit of our pivot to the growth areas of the market at a faster pace. Looking past the streamlining and transformation phase into fiscal year '18 and beyond, we will continue our focus on productivity and the improvements in efficiency will more substantially materialize. Our non-GAAP operating margins will improve towards the high-end of our target range, inclusive of SolidFire. By coupling the strength of our data fabric strategy and the benefits we deliver to customers with a more efficient and agile business, we can increase the value we generate for customers, partners, employees and shareholders. Overtime, we believe that the investments we've made in innovation and streamlining will enable us to grow at an accelerating pace with improved operating margin and cash flow. Our third priority is transparency. The progress we've already made in our pivot towards the growth areas of the market has not been easy to measure from outside the company. To help provide visibility into this transition, we are providing greater clarity into the dynamics of our product revenue. In Q3, our strategic solutions trusted ONTAP, branded E-Series, All Flash arrays, hybrid cloud solutions and OnCommand Insight made up almost 55% of product revenue and grew 26% year-over-year. By contrast, product revenue from our mature solutions OEM, ONTAP 7-Mode an add-on declined 40% year-over-year, predominantly from the declines in OEM and ONTAP 7-Mode. In Q2 FY '16 we reached a significant milestone, when the revenue from strategic solutions exceeded that of the mature ones. In other words, the products with the higher aggregate growth profile had a bigger proportion of our product revenue. We are getting closer to a mix, where our strategic solutions can drive a reacceleration of the business. This shift in the composition of our product revenue is a good indicator of the progress we've made in our pivot to the growth areas of the market. This plus our strong software and hardware maintenance revenues create a solid foundation for NetApp. The tight alignment between our strategic solutions and our customers IT imperatives underscores our confidence that we will generate continued growth from this area of the business. As part of their IT modernization efforts, customer's wants scale-out and software-defined storage functionality for the efficient management of data growth. Clustered ONTAP enables seamless data management across flash, disk and cloud footprints and across public and private clouds for enterprise applications, regardless of the underlying hardware. Clustered ONTAP was deployed in almost 80% of FAS systems shipped in Q3, up from roughly 40% a year-ago. Unit shipments of Clustered ONTAP systems saw strong continued customer demand, growing roughly 70% year-over-year. The clustered ONTAP transition acceleration program, we put in place at the start of the year, is speeding the migration of install base customers, who are ready to upgrade both their systems and their software from ONTAP 7-Mode to clustered ONTAP. Our FAS install base is growing and clustered ONTAP now represents 24% of installed systems. The installed base mix will continue to ship to clustered ONTAP, but you should not expect a linear progression. These migrations are projects that must fit within the overall IT priorities and budgets of our customers, and we anticipate that the transition of the install base will happen over the course of years. Both the total number of customers and new to NetApp customers, who made clustered ONTAP purchases in Q3, grew by approximately 60% from Q3 last year. Flash is becoming the de facto technology for primary workloads. Our EF All Flash arrays deliver the extreme performance for standalone applications that infrastructure buyers and application owners need. The All Flash FAS arrays have industry-leading data management services with a unified multi-protocol capability that appeals to infrastructure architects driving data center consolidation. Customer demand for our All Flash arrays continues to grow. Our existing All Flash array business, inclusive of EF and All Flash FAS products and services, has accelerated to an almost $600 million annual run rate. To this strong foundation, we are excited to add SolidFire's, unique scale-out block storage architecture that is compelling for the cloud architect, master minding the next generation data center. With this acquisition, NetApp is the clear technology leader in the All Flash array market with the broadest portfolio of All Flash arrays in the industry, addressing the diverse needs of enterprises and service providers, which cannot be adequately met by the one-size-fits-all compromise approach of our competitors. Our Data Fabric solutions are successfully positioning us to help customers with leading-edge cloud deployments. A leading Software-as-a-Service provider in the Asia-Pacific region, created a next generation service for its customers, utilizing NetApp private storage for cloud, AltaVault and OnCommand Insight, connected to multiple hyperscale clouds for compute services. They provide an outstanding customer experience and an enterprise solution built on a single modern platform with a consistent look and feel without the risk of single cloud dependency. By storing data on NetApp private storage, they can meet customer preference for a specific cloud provider as well as improve their ability to meet SLA guarantees by failing over to other clouds, when the primary cloud is unavailable. The myriad efficiency of NetApp private storage also allows them to improve their profitability by effectively storing less data on tiers of flash, and creating rapid virtual copies for test and development during new customer acquisitions. Additionally, they can satisfy regulators by proving where data resides at all times for government, financial services and healthcare customers. This is a great example of what I've discussed in the past, data is at the heart of the transmission our customers are going through to improve the efficiency of their businesses and better serve their customers. At the same time, they are reducing IT budgets, looking for simpler solutions and rethinking how they consume IT. This evaluation is diverting spend towards transformational projects and architectures like scale-out, software-defined, flash, converge and hybrid cloud, where our data fabric strategy gives us a compelling advantage. NetApp is the only company able to span flash to disk to cloud, and the only company delivering the ability to manage data across multiple clouds and on-premises today. Finally, I want to briefly touch on capital allocation, our fourth priority. I'll let Jeff get into the details, but in short, we are fully committed to executing our capital allocation programs and creating value for shareholders. We expect to complete our current share buyback authorization by the end of May 2018, as planned, and remain committed to our dividend program. I am more confident than ever in NetApp's potential. While we must manage through a dynamic IT market and declines in our mature solutions, we have a clear plan and a lot of positives. We have a large and growing install base. Our data fabric strategy uniquely enables us to assist customers in achieving their strategic IT imperatives. Our strategic solutions are greater than 50% of product revenue and growing. We are making substantial progress in the transition to clustered ONTAP. And we've just expanded our comprehensive All Flash array portfolio. We are keenly focused on our business model and managing our investments between our strategic and mature solutions. The changes we are making to streamline the business and reduce the cost structure will enable investment and strategic opportunities, while accelerating our ability to deliver shareholder value in the form of profitability and cash flow. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. I'll now turn it over to Jeff to take you through the numbers. Jeff? Jeffrey Bergmann : Thank you, and good afternoon to everyone. I'd like to start by thanking George and the NetApp Board for the opportunity to step-in as Interim CFO. It's an exciting time of transformation for NetApp, as we streamline the business to become more focused and efficient, and at the same time pivot the company toward growth areas of the market and take advantage of the opportunities in front of us. The team is energized to leverage the strength of our strategic solutions to bolster the company and ultimately drive growth. We have made good progress to date, and as you heard from George, are committed to providing you with greater visibility into the dynamics of our business. With that said, let's move to the financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. I want to remind you that unless otherwise specified, I will be using non-GAAP metrics to discuss our financial results and guidance. Q3 net revenues of $1.39 billion were down about 4% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. While there were indicators that strengthen our results, such as clustered ONTAP traction and rapid All Flash array adoption, which drove growth in our strategic solutions, our revenue performance felt short of our expectations. The shortfall was a result of a combination of the macroeconomic uncertainty George talked about, that created the lengthening of deal cycles, greater than anticipated rate of decline in our mature business and mix shift to deferred revenue and FX headwinds of about 3 points year-over-year. When we reiterated guidance in early January, our sales volume was in line with our forecast, which assumed a bank-end loaded quarter, consistent with historical performance and as is typical in the industry. However, after a moderate calendar year budget flush, that macroeconomic environment worsened and we saw an increase in the deferred mix of our business over the course of last two weeks of the quarter. Product revenue declined 8% sequentially and 19% year-over-year. We saw higher than expected volume of software and hardware maintenance contract renewals, as some customers opted to delay equipment purchases. The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenues was up 2% year-over-year. Now, to provide some context and better visibility into our business model, I'd like to walk through how we think about the strategic solutions revenue in software and hardware maintenance revenues coming together to create a foundation from which we can build. Revenue from strategic solutions continues to show strong growth, and as George highlighted, is now more than 50% of our product revenue. The year-over-year decline in our mature solutions revenue is driving overall product revenue declines in the near-term. But the size and growth of the strategic solutions revenue gives us confidence in our strategy to drive overall product revenue growth in the future. Looking at software and hardware maintenance revenues. I talked about the strength of our renewal business during the quarter, and as George said, 24% of our install base is running on clustered ONTAP. While the product revenue declines will ultimately pressure software and hardware maintenance revenues, the lengthening of product lifecycles, growth of our install base, rapidly increasing mix of clustered ONTAP install base, and high renewal volume create support for future software and hardware maintenance revenues. Indirect revenue accounted for 78% of net revenues. Gross margin was 63.1% in the third quarter, above our previous guidance, reflecting favorable mix, partially offset by aggressive pricing. Product gross margin of 51.1% was down about 6 points year-over-year, reflecting about 2 point of FX and higher discounting. Software maintenance gross margin was roughly flat, while hardware maintenance and other services gross margin was up about 2 points, largely reflecting higher contract renewal revenue, as well as services infrastructure cost efficiencies. Operating expenses of $630 million decreased 12% year-over-year, reflecting 3 points of the FX benefit, lower headcount related compensation costs and their early work toward driving greater efficiency across the business, as George mentioned in his opening remarks. Operating margin of 17.6% was almost 1 point above our guidance. Our effective tax rate was 14.9% and lower than our previous guidance, which reflects a change in the geographic mix of profits and its cumulative year-to-date impact. We expect our effective tax rate for Q4 to be approximately 16%. Our weighted average diluted share count for the third quarter was 296 million shares. Earnings per share was $0.70 within our guidance range. Moving on to cash and balance sheet metrics. We ended the quarter with approximately $5 billion in cash in short-term investments with approximately 12% held by our domestic entities. Deferred and financed unearned services revenue increased $80 million sequentially and $16 million year-over-year. Inventory turns increased to 20 and DSO was at 38 days. We generated $355 million in cash flow from operations during the quarter, up 29% year-over-year. Free cash flow of $314 million was about 23% in net revenues, up 217% sequentially and 28% year-over-year. We expect free cash flow as a percentage of revenue for Q4 to be slightly above 20%. Now, I'd like to discuss share repurchases for a moment. In Q3, we repurchased approximately $85 million of our stock. This was less than we would have liked due to the events such as the SolidFire transaction, which reduced the number of days we could be in the market. However, as George noted, we remain fully committed to completing our $2.5 billion share repurchase program by the end of May 2018, with [ph] $262 million is remaining by the end of May 2016. Additionally, we paid $52 million in cash dividends in the third quarter. Today, we also announced next cash dividend of $0.18 per share of the company's common stock, which will be paid on April 27, 2016. Overall, we are confident in our allocation of capital between growth initiatives and shareholder returns, as we continue to execute on our transformation strategy. Looking forward to guidance. Given the increasingly uncertain macroeconomic environment, continued shifts in enterprise IT spending and our own work in transforming the company, we are tempering our forecast. For the fourth quarter, we are forecasting a revenue range of $1.35 billion to $1.5 billion. Given the aggressive pricing environment, we expect gross margins to decline to approximately 61.5%, driven by higher discounting, which will be partially offset by cost savings initiatives. Looking at operating margin, we are transforming the company in order to streamline the business, improve efficiency, become more focused and enhance our ability to rapidly address the changing market. Our initiatives will fundamentally change the way we do business by centralizing similar activities across functions, optimizing geographic location resources and consolidating suppliers. We are better positioning NetApp for near and long-term success, while reducing our cost structure across both cost of revenues and OpEx and ensuring that the changes we make are sustainable. To minimize disruption, the pace of these changes will be dictated by the company's preparedness for each transformative initiative. As George mentioned, we're driving to achieve a gross run rate savings of $400 million by the end of fiscal 2017, which will include the previously announced discontinuance of our flash array product line. We plan to use these cost savings to minimize erosion of margins in a price competitive environment. We will reinvest some of the gross savings into strategic opportunities, such as SolidFire and productivity improvements, yielding a net run rate savings of roughly $130 million by the end of fiscal 2017. While George touched upon several initiatives that are already underway, we will provide more specifics around additional initiatives, as they are executed. As a step towards lowering our cost and rewiring the company, we will initiate a headcount reduction of approximately 12% during the fourth quarter. We expect to realize Q4 savings of just over $30 million, resulting in a Q4 operating margin of approximately 15% and earnings per share target range of $0.55 to $0.60 for the fourth quarter, including the impact of the SolidFire acquisition. We expect a GAAP restructuring charge of approximately $60 million to $70 million in Q4 relating to this action. Finally, to help with your models, I'd like to provide some color around the impact of SolidFire on our outlook. As you know, the acquisition closed on February 2. We funded the transaction through a short-term loan of $870 million. We intend to integrate SolidFire into our global operating structure and expect to retire the acquisition debt with our global earnings by the beginning of Q3 FY '17. In Q4, we expect SolidFire to reduce operating margin by about 3 points, resulting in an operating margin of approximately 15%. Looking forward to FY '17, we expect our strategic plans for SolidFire to contribute about 2 points of revenue growth and be dilutive to operating profit by about 2 points and to earnings per share by $0.28 to $0.30. This is at the high-end of the guidance range that we gave you on the acquisition call as that range includes benefit of flash array discontinuance, which we are now reporting as part of the overall cost reduction plan. We anticipate that SolidFire will be accretive in FY '18. The IT environment is changing rapidly and we've provided a lot of additional content to give you more insight into how it's impacting us and the actions we're taking to adapt. Let me summarize the four themes around this transformation that I want to ensure that you take away from this call. First, underlying our topline results there is a strong strategic business that is material and growing. Second, we are significantly reducing the cost structure of our core NetApp business, aligning our resources to the market opportunity, which will expand operating margin. Third, we are committed to providing greater transparency and visibility into our business. And fourth, we're committed to our capital allocation strategy of providing a meaningful dividend that grows over time and executing a robust share repurchase program, while investing in the long-term growth of the business. With that, I would like to hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris? Kris Newton : We'll now open the call for Q&A. Please be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to one question, so we can get to as many people as possible. Thank you for your cooperation. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Steven Fox of Cross Research. Steven Fox : George, just on the cost saving initiatives and the $400 million total, can you sort of foot that versus what you just announced? In other words, how much of the $400 million was realized to date? And if you, I assume that's a gross number, so if you net that out what were the savings? And then specifically, where were you getting them from? And along those lines, I guess, there's some product mix issues that are helping you as well, can you address that in terms of just how your margins are benefiting? George Kurian : The total program is a comprehensive program that encompasses across the board, business process redesign, organizational restructuring and realignment and further streamlining of the portfolio. The total dollar savings that we are going after, the gross savings, between the end of Q3 of fiscal '16 and the end of fiscal '17 is a gross number of $400 million in cost savings. The first step in that program is the restructuring action that we are announcing today, and which will be complete in Q4. Within Q4, we will be recording about $30 million of savings from the action itself, which over a full year annualized run rate is about $200 million. Steven Fox : Just to be clear there, that's without any mix benefits, that's just all costs going forward, then the mix would be separate? George Kurian : That's correct. Kris Newton : Thanks, Steve. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of James Kisner of Jefferies LLC. James Kisner : So you said that 55% of your product revenue I think in Q3 was strategic solutions. I'm just wondering if could you share some rough thoughts on what you think that composition might be as you exit fiscal '17 that gives you confidence that you'll be set up to return revenue growth in FY '18. George Kurian : I think as we indicated, we are providing greater visibility into the product mix between our mature products and our strategic products. I think we've also given you the size and relative growth rates of each of those categories. We're not going to provide guidance beyond that in terms of the specific buckets. Add-on storage, just to be clear, is not going to go to zero from the mature bucket. From the mature bucket the declines are primarily from 7-Mode and OEM. The add-on piece of the mature bucket is essentially going through a transition from 7-Mode to clustered ONTAP, and so will be the majority of the mature bucket going forward. Kris Newton : Thanks, James. Next question? Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Maynard Um of Wells Fargo. Maynard Um : I just wanted to make sure I understood the use of cash. I understand that you're still committed to the capital allocation program, but should we anticipate that you'll pause the share repurchase as you focus on paying down the debt. And it also feels like you have a broad portfolio to address the growth areas of the market. So should we read into those comments that a use of cash wouldn't be to do further M&A? Jeffrey Bergmann : So we do plan to resume our stock repurchase activity in the quarter. Our stock price, obviously, is attractive at these levels and we will look forward to be opportunistic. I would say that in terms of M&A, we are really focused on integrating SolidFire and so our focus will be to invest in that area rather than focus on M&A at this point. Kris Newton : Thanks, Maynard. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall of JPMorgan. Rod Hall : I just wanted to circle back to these percentages of strategic and mature revenue that you guys talked about and the growth rates. I guess if I assume that the balance of the revenue, the 55% is mature, and I just multiply it by growth rates, I get the wrong number. So I'm wondering if you could help us kind of reconcile that percentages in growth rates back to the reported product revenue growth rate, so that we understand is there another segment in there you're not talking about? And what is the growth rate in that segment? And then I have one follow-up as well. George Kurian : The product revenue numbers essentially are broken out in 100% between the mature pieces and the strategic pieces. I would tell you that in the mature pieces, you should be cognizant of the facts that the declines are primarily in the 7-Mode and OEM pieces of the mature bucket. The add-on storage numbers are essentially a large percentage of the mature bucket and they are not deteriorating at the rate of 7-Mode or OEM. They're essentially going through the transition from 7 to clustered ONTAP. And so will be a relatively stable business, will also be affected by the trends of disc to flash. But I would just tell you that a 100% of our product revenues are either categorized as mature or strategic. Rod Hall : George, just on my follow-up. If you multiply the things out, so 55% product revenue by 26% growth and then the remaining 45% via 40% decline you get like 4% decline, which isn't the same thing that you guys reported. So maybe offline you guys could elaborate or later in the call. And then it would also be helpful if you could those growth rates that you call out for this quarter last quarter, so we can see the trajectory like are we seeing stabilization of the decline in the mature stuff? Jeffrey Bergmann : Real quickly, I think the reason why the math may not work is the percentages that we are calculating are based upon our gross revenue for those product lines, but that sit within mature and strategic. Kris Newton : Thanks, Rod. Next question? Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Sherri Scribner : I just want to clarify; I think you said that the All Flash array business was now for you $600 million run rate, which I assume does not include SolidFire? And how much SolidFire revenue are you expecting or including in the guidance for fiscal 4Q? Jeffrey Bergmann : So the $600 million run rate on the flash business is just EF and our AFF product lines. That doesn't include SolidFire. We just have minimal revenue planned in Q4 for SolidFire in our plan. Kris Newton : Thanks, Sherri. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian White of Drexel Hamilton. Brian White : You talked about business slowing a bit at the end of January. Maybe you can just walk us around the world and give us a view of what you're seeing by geography and also by vertical? George Kurian : So our business reflected the general commentary in the market about the macro. Asia Pacific, particularly the economy is dependant on China, as well as Japan saw a pretty choppy business in January. Certainly sectors like oil and gas and countries that are dependent on oil and gas were also affected. The service provider business in the U.S. is down as many telcos are divesting of their cloud business and reevaluating their approach to the data center business. And as we noted before, 2015 has been a year where the U.S. Fed has lower IT spending as well as shifted priorities within this spending envelope to initiatives such as cyber security and some on the cloud. Kris Newton : Thanks Brian. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Amit Daryanani : I guess just from the strategic piece of the revenue that's growing 20% plus, basically the gross numbers. Could you just talk about -- give us sense on how much of that is potentially just cannibalizing your own legacy or mature piece of business versus what's net-new? And then the strategic bucket itself, do you think its margin and free cash flow accretive versus the overall business or it's dilutive to your model? George Kurian : First of all, in terms of clustered ONTAP the net new-to-NetApp customers and total customers on clustered ONTAP grew strongly 60% year-on-year. So we are winning more than our fair share of both new customers, as well as transformational activity within our existing customers using our strategic solutions. I would say that the EF-Series, the All Flash arrays are also primarily growing in parts of the market that we historically did not serve the high performance fiber channel segment of the market. So we feel good about the new solutions being allowing us to get wallet share in both existing customers as well as net new-to-NetApp customers. Jeffrey Bergmann : Just to add on the margin, we think that the shift between the mature and strategic is pretty much neutral in terms of gross margin. Kris Newton : Thanks, Amit. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz of Barclays. Mark Moskowitz : I want to talk maybe bigger picture, just given this kind of perennial cost cutting and kind of almost the morale busting job force reduction you're announcing today, are you signaling despite your optimism around some of these strategic imperatives that longer-term the storage market is going to decrease and compress for other reasons outside of your control, whether it's from the cloud displacement or just because of data-reduction technologies, because I'm just trying to reconcile some of your optimism around why you're going to cut more muscle from the bone? George Kurian : We are going through, as I indicated on the call, we are going through a transition in our business from the traditional to the strategic segments of our business. We feel very good about the strategic portions of our business growing double-digits. At the same time, we want to manage the business responsibly, as we go through the transition and set up the company to be able to generate margins and shareholder returns in a moderated growth environment. We are not sacrificing investments in growth areas. For example, we are continuing to invest in our All Flash arrays, we continue to invest in clustered ONTAP acceleration, we continue to invest in strategic solutions like SolidFire and our hybrid cloud solutions. We're just getting much more focused on the company as a company on the parts of the market that are really growing. Jeffrey Bergmann : Yes, Mark, I would just add a little briefly on that that we've done a pretty extensive analysis on our operating model and compared ourselves to the top performing companies. And this is really about aligning ourselves with the profile that we need to address the market going forward and feel confident in where we're ending up. Kris Newton : Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Milunovich of UBS. Steve Milunovich : George, you kind of positioned the recovery beginning in '18, so I know it's premature perhaps. But when you think about '17, it sounds like you might be kind of in a mid-teens operating margin, you're going to have some SolidFire revenues, so I don't know revenue maybe flattish to slightly down. Just curious, if you are prepared to make any broad comments about what '17 looks like before things accelerated to '18? George Kurian : We're not going to provide any comments and guidance on '17. We'll give you that when we're ready to do so. Right now, we're focused on streamlining the business and doing so in a responsible fashion, so that we can manage the risk, but also make sure that we can take the strategic actions that set us up for a better productivity model going forward. Steve Milunovich : Do you view it as a transition year? George Kurian : '17 as I said, if you do the evaluation of our strategic solutions and our mature parts of the portfolio, we still have some transition ahead of us. Kris Newton : Thanks, Steve. Next question, please? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse. Kulbinder Garcha : I just had a clarification, on the $400 million of cost savings, is it right to think $200 million OpEx and $200 million of cost of goods sold [indiscernible] clarification. And then my deeper question is --. Kris Newton : Kulbinder, we can barely hear you. Kulbinder Garcha : My question is on the $400 million of cost savings, how does that split between OpEx and COGS? George Kurian : We would tell you once we get through the cost savings approach. As I said, we've got programs in flight, some of which are already in flight, some of which have been part of the Q4 restructuring action. We'll give you more detailed updates as we execute the transformation program. Jeffrey Bergmann : Just to add a little color to that, the $400 million is really -- we expect to accomplish that during FY '17 and part of Q4, so that is really a run rate exit level for FY '17. Kris Newton : Thanks, Kulbinder. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers of Stifel. Aaron Rakers : I want to go into the revenue a little bit. As you guys go through this transformation, it looks like you still have about high-30% kind of 40% contribution of your revenue coming off the balance sheet software entitlement maintenance, as well as the maintenance service revenue. So as you see the declines in your traditional or mature businesses, how are we to think about the progression of that revenue as we look into fiscal '17? George Kurian : First of all, I'll let Jeff provide some more details. But our install base is growing. The install base of systems that are under maintenance contracts with NetApp is growing, both reflecting a longer lifespan of utilization of existing systems and their strategic value-serving, high-performance, data-rich applications in our customers, but also the fact that our strategic solutions are growing. So our overall install base of systems is growing, which is supportive of the fact that our maintenance revenues are strong. Jeffrey Bergmann : I would just add to that. We just think that that provides us a strong foundation for that revenue stream. We clearly have an install base that's growing, and with cDOT at 24% and growing, we think that gives us confidence in that as we move forward. Kris Newton : Thanks, Aaron. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva of Citigroup. Jim Suva : Can you help us understand how we should quantify or measure the milestones of the SourceFire acquisition, whether that be profitability or breakeven of earnings or revenues, how can we measure the integration? And do you actually have a timeline for breakeven? George Kurian : SolidFire will be accretive in fiscal year '18. We'll provide more insight into the program, as we integrate that and as we lay out our plans for fiscal year '17. But at the moment, we'd see that SolidFire will be accretive in fiscal year '18. Kris Newton : Thank you. Next questions please. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski of Piper Jaffray. Andrew Nowinski : So sorry if I missed it, but can you give us any color on your new customer growth relative to prior quarters, because that may give us a better sense of how compelling clustered ONTAP is relative to some of the other next-gen vendors like Nutanix and Tintri and others? George Kurian : We've got good growth quarter-on-quarter as well as year-on-year. As I said, year-on-year net new-to-NetApp, as well as cDOT customers in aggregate grew 60% year-on-year. And so we feel good about both expanding footprints in existing customers, as well as access to net-new customers. SolidFire, for example, allows us to be able to be competitive in customer environments that have historically valued the extreme simplicity, as well as the efficiency of hyper conversion environments. We've seen good success with SolidFire's base of customers that are able to meet that design point. So we think that both clustered ONTAP and SolidFire give us good footprints in both traditional as well as emerging categories. Kris Newton : Thanks, Andrew. Next question. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Brian Alexander of Raymond James. Bob Hahn : This is actually Bob Hahn calling in for Brian. I just wanted to ask a quick question regarding your 7-Mode install base. I know last quarter you mentioned that Q2 marked the first time that you did not experience growth in the 7-Mode install base. Now, I was wondering if that install base is now declining, and do you think that you'll be able to convert over a lot of these customers or how confident are you that you can convert over these customers over time? George Kurian : The aggregate install base of 7-Mode and clustered ONTAP FAS Systems is actually growing. So we feel good, not only about the overall install base, but if you think about the percentage of the install base that its clustered ONTAP, it's at 24%, up from 17% a quarter ago, so strong growth in terms of the install base and execution. I would tell you that the pace of those transitions are IT projects in our customer environments, right. And so to the extent that enterprise IT spending overall is pressured there will be some tactical moves that customers might make to just stay on 7 for a period of time before they cut over. The programs that we initiated at the start of the year, clustered ONTAP accelerations program have seen strong growth. We've already exceeded our expectations for the year with that program in terms of customers, the total volume of transactions, as well as the number of resellers engaged in moving customers, so we feel good. Kris Newton : Thanks Bob. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Srini Nandury of Summit Research. Srini Nandury : Can you talk about the competitive environment, who is being aggressive and what's your outlook for the startups who are competing in the space? George Kurian : I would say that the competitive environment, we have seen some more price discounting from select players in the market. We think that the dynamic of them discounting is relatively unchanged. HP, HDS, they are the key players that lack the innovation value, so they are being aggressive on price to compete. We don't see much change from the startups. I think Nimble has continued to retrench mostly into the SMB market. Pure is unchanged in terms of its competitive stance and EMC is challenged with the transaction that they are about to undertake. So we do see some opportunities where we have been able to take footprints from EMC, given the lack of clarity in terms of their roadmap going forward. Kris Newton : Thanks, Srini. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin of Pacific Crest Securities. Brent Bracelin : George, I had a follow-up on the mature products segment. As you think about that 44% decline that you saw this quarter, how much would you attribute to a pause, macro-related concern versus a more accelerated shift towards this industry transitioning into flash and cloud? If you could help us parse out that decline and how much of it is kind of a change in the environment and the demand environment versus more of an acceleration to these transitions? George Kurian : I would say, there was certainly a percentage of it that was rather than doing technology refresh, it was basically moved towards a maintenance contract or a service agreement, that said here I'm going to wait until I see what happens in the macro before undertaking a big project. I don't think that represents a shift to the cloud, it's just I'm not ready to take on a major capital project at this point in time. It's much more of the discussion threat there. I think in terms of the migrations from our existing platforms to solid state, I would say that the strength of our solid-state portfolio is not just a transition from our existing footprint, right. We are actually getting a lot of new customers, because the majority of our footprint is essentially with solid-state arrays is in high-performance fiber-channel environments that we historically did not have a big landscape in. So I would say that some of the declines are from pauses, some of them are from our natural migrations to clustered ONTAP and some of it is essentially going through a period of, I've got enough things going on in my business, where I've acquired new platforms and I'm waiting to consume them. Kris Newton : Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Simona Jankowski : I think you said that you had a $600 million run rate in the flash products. And on the call in December, I think you cited $370 million, which would imply about 60% quarter-on-quarter growth. I just wanted to clarify that I've got that correctly? And then in terms of my question, I wanted to ask about your strategy for addressing the hyper converge segment of the market? George Kurian : First of all, your analysis is correct, Simona, on the sequential growth rate. The second is, in terms of the hyper converge market, we see what customers really want is essentially simplified provisioning and operational management, a relatively simple pay-as-you-go building block architecture. And you will see us address those customer needs with both the SolidFire architecture, which is built with a scale-out, simplified design right out of the get-go as well as some exciting new innovations in the flex spot lineup. Kris Newton : Next question? Operator : And our final question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini of Susquehanna Financial. David Ryzhik : This is David Ryzhik for Mehdi Hosseini. Just going to April guidance, April quarter guidance for gross margins, it looks like its down 200 basis points quarter-over-quarter and it seems like higher discounting is the reason. But earlier on the call you mentioned that the dynamics of discounting is unchanged. So just wanted to clarify, does this mean that pricing pressure has basically accelerated in the April quarter? And should we anticipate that in both the strategic and mature or mostly in the mature segment of the business? George Kurian : These are year-on-year numbers. I think we are being cautious about the mix, we're being cautious about the macroeconomic environment and typically the discounting behavior in our yearend quarter. Jeffrey Bergmann : And there's also just an unfavorable product mix involved in that as well. Kris Newton : I'm going to pass it over to George for some final comment. End of Q&A George Kurian : In closing, let me reiterate my confidence in NetApp's potential. We have a lot of positives with our strategic solutions that are the foundation of how we enable customer success in the data-powered digital era. We have a large and growing install base, our data fabric strategy uniquely enables us to assist customers in achieving their strategic IT imperatives. Our strategic solutions are greater than 50% of product revenue and growing. We are making substantial progress in the transition to clustered ONTAP. And we've just expanded our comprehensive All Flash array portfolio. While we must manage through a dynamic IT market and declines in our mature solutions, we have a clear plan to drive long-term growth and profitability. We are focused on driving continued growth of the strategic solutions. We are substantially reducing cost and systematically streamlining the business. We are providing greater transparency to give you better visibility into the basis of our confidence. And finally, we remain committed to our capital allocation strategy. Thank you. I look forward to giving you further updates next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] I\u2019d now like to hand the conference over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kris Newton : Hello, and thank you for joining us on our Q4 fiscal year 2016 earnings call. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Ron Pasek. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our Web site at netapp.com along with the earnings release, our financial tables and guidance, a historical supplemental data table and a non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation. As a reminder, during today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year 2017, our expectations regarding future revenue growth, improved profitability, including run rate savings, cash flow, effective tax rate and shareholder returns, our expectations about our ability to drive operational and financial performance and about the impact of the SolidFire acquisition and business, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. Such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and are being made as of today. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons, including the macroeconomic environment, overall growth rates for IT, our ability to successfully pivot to the growth areas of the market and enable customer migrations to our strategic solutions, our ability to expand our operating margin, our ability to reduce our cost structure, streamline the business and improve efficiency within the planned timeframe, and our ability to continue our capital allocation strategy and invest in strategic opportunities. Please refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC, specifically our most recent Forms 10-Q, our Form 10-K for fiscal year 2015 and our current reports on Form 8-K, all of which can be found on our Web site. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. I'll now turn the call over to George. George Kurian : Thanks, Kris, and good afternoon, everyone. In Q4, we continued our disciplined execution. Revenue and EPS were within our guidance ranges, despite significant and ongoing changes to both the industry and NetApp. Like others, we continue to experience constrained enterprise IT spending, as customers act with caution due to an uncertain macroeconomic environment and shift some of their workloads to the cloud. As we discussed last quarter, we're making fundamental changes to return the Company to revenue growth with improved profitability, cash flow, and shareholder returns. To deliver on this commitment, we're executing a comprehensive and sustained transformation. Let me remind you of the key priorities associated with this plan. First, we're focused on our data fabric strategy and the strategic solutions that form the foundation of how we enable customer success in the data powered digital era. To provide context for our confidence in the future, we're providing greater transparency into the progress of these solutions. Second, we're substantially reducing cost and systematically streamlining our operations, while maintaining our ability to deliver innovation and lead the market. And third, we have a robust capital allocation program which includes a combination of share repurchases, dividends, and investment for the long-term growth of the business. I'll start with an update on the first priority, our emphasis on strategic solutions. We're facilitating our customer success as they navigate through their own IT transformations, which leverage modern architectures and hybrid cloud environments. Our strategic solutions, cluster data ONTAP, branded E-Series, All-Flash-Arrays including SolidFire, hybrid cloud solutions and OnCommand Insight enable these transformations and are the basis of our pivot to the growth segments of the market. In Q4, strategic solutions increased to 61% of net product revenue. For the full-year, strategic solutions were 53% of net product revenue and grew 21% from fiscal year '15. The alignment of our strategic solutions with our customers IT imperatives underpins our confidence that these solutions will expand our leadership in the fastest-growing segments of the market. As expected, net product revenue from our mature solutions, OEM, ONTAP 7-Mode and add-on, for both Q4 and the full-year declined at roughly 40% year-over-year, driven by declines in ONTAP 7-Mode. As mature solutions become a smaller contributor to product revenue, the headwinds they generate will lessen. This will allow the growth of our strategic solutions to drive a reacceleration of the business and return the Company to moderated revenue growth in fiscal '18. As a part of their IT transformation efforts, customer's want scale out and software defined storage functionality for the efficient management of data growth and to achieve the agility and flexibility needed for success in the data powered digital era. Uniquely in the storage industry, clustered ONTAP enables seamless enterprise data management across flash disc, public, and private cloud footprints for enterprise applications. With clustered ONTAP, IT organizations can consolidate multiple workloads into a single repository, dramatically improving the efficiency of their storage environments when compared to the siloed legacy SAN architectures that we're displacing. Clustered ONTAP was deployed on 85% of FAS systems shipped in Q4, up from 50% a year-ago. Customer demand for clustered ONTAP accelerated from Q3 with system shipments growing roughly 80% year-over-year. Our install base of clustered ONTAP and 7-Mode systems continues to grow in total and clustered ONTAP is now running on 26% of that growing installed base. In addition, we increased the number of clustered ONTAP customers by almost 90% in fiscal year '16 from the prior year. We're pleased with the success of the clustered ONTAP transition program we put in place at the start of the year. In fiscal year '16, it accelerated migrations that approximately 1,300 install base customers who were ready to upgrade both their systems and their software. The install base mix will continue to shift to clustered ONTAP. However, as we said before, we anticipate that this transition will happen over the course of years as these migrations are projects that must fit within our customers overall IT priorities and budgets. In the coming weeks, you will hear about breakthrough innovations, as we introduce the next generation of ONTAP, which combines new levels of simplicity with unparalleled storage efficiencies and enterprise data management capabilities. It will simplify customers IT transformations to modern data centers and hybrid cloud environments, and customers can choose the architecture of their choice, engineered systems, software defined storage, or cloud, all with industry-leading efficiency, performance, and density for flash environments, rapid and simplified deployment, and greater data protection and security. In fiscal year '16, we accelerated the adoption of clustered ONTAP and moved into a leadership position in the flash market and we expect to break away from the fact with the next generation of ONTAP. As customers build private clouds or move to hybrid cloud environments, they need to monitor and manage their storage as an end-to-end service across heterogeneous public and private clouds. OnCommand Insight addresses this requirement and enables customers to simplify their operations and substantially lower costs. Together clustered ONTAP and OnCommand Insight, give customers the ability to bring tremendous efficiency to their IT environments. One of the largest children's hospitals in the U.S chose All-Flash FAS running clustered ONTAP to replace legacy high-end frame arrays from our leading competitor and will also utilize OnCommand Insight to manage their entire heterogeneous storage infrastructure across multiple data centers. Flash plays a key role in customers IT transformation efforts, as they seek to gain advantage through greater speed, responsiveness, and value from key business applications while substantially lowering total cost of ownership. The continually improving performance and economics of flash is enabling modern modular storage systems with scale out software to replace legacy frame array SAN architectures. Flash is becoming the de facto technology for primary workloads as customers look to realize performance and economic benefits by replacing hard disk installations with flash. As they make this transition, customers cannot forgo enterprise data management and data protection capabilities. With a highly differentiated and complete portfolio of All-Flash-Array offerings, NetApp is without question far better positioned to enable customers to accomplish this transition than any other vendor. We won a multimillion dollar deal over emerging All-Flash competitors at a U.S base customer in the transportation industry, with All-Flash FAS and EF for its production database, DDI, and disaster recovery environments. They chose NetApp due to the reliability and rich feature set of our product portfolio. Reflecting this strength are All-Flash-Array business inclusive of All-Flash FAS, EF and SolidFire product and services grew 35% from Q3 to an annualized net revenue run rate of over $700 million. The majority of this growth was driven by high demand for the All-Flash FAS. In addition to providing a complete set of enterprise data management and protection capabilities, we enable customers to preserve and leverage existing investments while taking advantage of new technologies and rapidly improving cost curves by supporting mixed capacity SSDs within a single system, something that most of our competitors cannot do. Soon we will become the first vendor to give customers the ability to take advantage of 16 terabyte solid-state drives. Our support for mixed capacities will create even greater customer value with the introduction of these high-capacity SSDs by allowing further workload and system consolidation dramatically reducing data center space requirements. I'm pleased to report that the integration of SolidFire is going well and progressing as planned. The NetApp sales team is selling SolidFire as part of the portfolio and introducing it into new accounts. We're winning against and replacing footprints of both established and emerging vendors in customers building next generation data centers. Execution of the product roadmap is on track and we will have exciting SolidFire innovations to announce in early June. NetApp has an extraordinary opportunity to help customers as they move to modern architectures and hybrid cloud solutions. Our data fabric strategy enables data management that seamlessly connects disparate clouds and data centers. We enable our customers to manage secure and protect their data across flash, disc, and public and private cloud resources, all at the scale needed to accommodate the exponential data growth of the digital world. A leading telecommunications and service provider in the Asia-Pacific region has embraced our hybrid cloud strategy, leveraging clustered ONTAP, our flash technologies, and data fabric capabilities to evolve its cloud offerings. They are deploying a solution that leverages the public cloud while retaining data sovereignty. It will give their customers choice, control, and confidence and improve business agility by enabling the movement of data in and out of multiple clouds from an on-premises private clouds into a public cloud and perhaps back again, all seamlessly. The service provider is so confident in the solution themselves that they are moving their primary workloads to it, in order to solve their own data management challenges. Ron will go into depth about cost savings and capital allocation, but I want to underscore our commitment to both of these priorities. We've launched a comprehensive program to reduce the cost base of our business, even while investing in strategic opportunities such as SolidFire. In Q4, we took the first significant step in achieving these savings and I want to thank the NetApp team for remaining focused on execution while making difficult restructuring decisions. We are also fully committed to executing our capital allocation programs and creating value for shareholders. In conclusion, I want to spend a little time reflecting on the strides we\u2019ve made this year. When I took over as CEO, NetApp was dealing with several internal challenges. We were late to the All-Flash-Array market. We were not prepared to assist our installed base of customers in migrating to clustered ONTAP, and we had limited traction in the hybrid cloud. Over the course of the year, we've made substantial progress. We have moved into a leadership position in the flash market with a broad portfolio that addresses multiple workload requirements and deployment styles. We regain ground with our channel partners by successfully enabling them to migrate the installed base to clustered ONTAP. Our data fabric strategy has proven effective in positioning us to win leading-edge cloud deployments. Additionally, we\u2019ve added key new leaders with fresh insight and deep experience to the management team and the Board of Directors and took the first step to permanently lowering our cost base. Heading into fiscal year '17, our momentum with customers is accelerating. Data is at the heart of our customers IT transformation efforts and this is where NetApp has a profoundly important role to play. Our strategic relevance to customers digital transformation roadmaps is evidenced by the growth of our strategic solutions. We're making meaningful progress, but still have work ahead of us and remain focused on execution. I remain highly confident in NetApp's potential. The leadership team is sharply focused on our business model and committed to returning the Company to long-term growth and our target operating margin. The fundamental transformation we're undertaking to streamline the business and reduce the cost base, will position us for future success by allowing investment in strategic opportunities, while accelerating our ability to deliver shareholder value in the form of improved profitability and cash flow. I'll now turn the call over to Ron to take you through the numbers. I'm sure many of you already know him. In our search for a CFO, I look for someone who is forward-looking, operationally astute, collaborative and an effective leader with high standards of ethics and integrity. We found that in Ron and I'm very excited that he is on board as part of this leadership team. Welcome Ron. Ron Pasek : Thank you, George, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. I\u2019m looking forward to meeting with many of you in the coming months. Before I get started, I\u2019d like to thank the Board and George, for the confidence they\u2019ve placed in me and the NetApp team for the warm welcome I received. I\u2019m excited to be joining the team at this time for a number of reasons. As a long time NetApp customer, I know firsthand the innovative products and passionate employees that are core to NetApp's strong foundation. In the short time I've been with NetApp, I continue to be very impressed with the commitment of employees, the dedication and quality of the management team, and the relentless focus on customer success. I look forward to building on NetApp's strong foundation and leveraging my experience to help execute our transformation efforts to drive long-term growth and streamline the business. Now before providing detail on our fiscal 2016 performance and forward-looking guidance, I\u2019d like to first discuss our results for Q4. As a reminder, unless otherwise noted, I'll be referring to non-GAAP metrics today. Q4 net revenues of $1.38 billion were relatively flat on a sequential basis and down 10% year-over-year. Product revenue was up about 1% sequentially and declined 17% year-over-year. While branded product revenue was in line with our expectations, discounting and promotions remained high and we had six points of impact sequentially and four point of impact year-over-year from weaker than expected OEM business. As George discussed, revenue from strategic solutions continues to grow, but are not yet sufficient to offset the headwinds from mature areas of our business. As expected, revenue declines in our mature solutions continue to put pressure on overall product revenue. The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenue was down 2% sequentially and relatively flat year-over-year. Our gross margin was 61.1%. Product gross margin of 46.8% was down about seven points year-over-year. The decline in ASPs outpaced the decline in average unit cost, largely due to discounting and product promotions. Software maintenance gross margin was essentially flat year-over-year while hardware maintenance and other services gross margin was up approximately five points, largely reflecting the continued services infrastructure cost efficiencies and ongoing improvements in product quality. Operating margin of 13.4% decreased 4 points sequentially and 2 points year-over-year, driven by lower revenue, lower product margin, and the acquisition SolidFire, partially offset by the lower cost of hardware maintenance revenue and OpEx. As outlined in last quarter, we're driving to achieve a gross run rate savings of $400 million across both cost of revenue and OpEx by the end of fiscal 2017. We will reinvest some of these savings into strategic opportunities such as SolidFire and other initiatives, yielding a net run rate savings of roughly $130 million by the end of fiscal 2017. In Q4, we took significant steps forward by reducing our headcount by approximately 11% sequentially. This action results in a GAAP restructuring charge of approximately $80 million and a gross savings of approximately $32 million in Q4. To be clear, aligning our cost structure with the opportunity ahead of us is my top priority, given it's completely within our control. We\u2019re driving additional changes that include implementing tighter cost controls over indirect spending, improving supply chain efficiency, portfolio streamlining, operational process redesign, and organizational restructuring and realignment. We will report back quarterly with more specifics as we realize these savings. Our effective tax rate was 13.1% for the quarter, lower than our previous guidance reflecting the impact of our geographic sales mix. EPS was within our guidance range of $0.55 per share. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were approximately 287 million. Moving on to cash and balance sheet metrics for Q4, we generated $345 million in cash flow from operations during the quarter, down 13% year-over-year. Free cash flow of $310 million was about 22% of net revenues, down 1% sequentially and 14% year-over-year. Deferred revenue and financed unearned services revenue of $259 million was up 8% versus Q3 and 6% versus last year. Inventory turns increased to 22 turns and DSO was 54 days, reflecting a back end loaded quarter. Finally we repurchased approximately $262 million of stock and paid $51 million in cash dividends in the fourth quarter. Now turning to fiscal year 2016 results. Net revenues for the full-year of $5.55 billion were down about 9% from fiscal 2015. Gross margin of 62.5% was down about a 0.5% from fiscal 2015, reflecting discounting and product promotions we ran throughout most of fiscal 2016. Operating margin of 13.5% was down 3.5 points versus fiscal 2015. Our effective tax rate for the year was 15.4%. EPS for the year was $2.13 down about 21% from fiscal 2015. We ended the year with approximately $5.3 billion in cash and short-term investments with approximately 10% held by our domestic entities. Over the course the year, we generated $814 million in free cash flow. We continue to deliver on our capital allocation strategy. Over the course of FY16, we returned over 140% of free cash flow to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. Finally we completed the first billion dollars of the $2.5 billion repurchase program we announced in February 2015 ahead of our original schedule. Through dividends and share repurchases, we have returned approximately $4.6 billion to shareholders since May 2013. This represents over 150% of free cash flow generated during that timeframe. We remain on track to complete the remaining $1.5 billion of the share repurchase program by the end of May 2018. Today we also announced an increase in our next cash dividend of $0.19 per share which we paid on July 27, 2016. Now to guidance. We're confident in our competitive positioning and long-term growth potential. However, we expect fiscal 2017 to be year of transition, while we transform the Company in order to streamline the business, improve efficiency and rapidly address the changing market. Consistent with what was said last quarter, we expect that the growth of our strategic solutions will offset the declines in our mature solutions and ultimately drive moderated revenue growth as we emerge from FY17. For FY17, we're forecasting gross margin of 61% to 63%. We expect operating margin of 15% to 17% including about 2 points of dilution from SolidFire. We expect our effective tax rate for the year to be approximately 16.5% and we expect to generate significant free cash flow enabling us to invest in the business, as well as to continue to again return significant capital to our shareholders. Finally, we remain committed to delivering meaningful EPS growth including dilution from SolidFire through leverage in our business model. Turning to outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we're targeting a net revenue range of $1.2 billion to $1.35 billion. At the midpoint, this implies a year-over-year decline of 4.5%, which reflects a reduction in declines as strategic overtakes mature. As a reminder, year-over-year compares are against the 14-week quarter we had in Q1 of fiscal 2016, which benefited software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenues. We expect gross margin of 62% to 63%, reflecting the impact of continued product promotions partially offset by cost savings initiatives. We're targeting operating margin of approximately 10% and an EPS range of $0.34 to $0.39. In closing, I\u2019m excited to be here and want to emphasize that everyone at NetApp is focused and committed to permanently transforming the business by pivoting towards the growth areas of the market, and reducing costs while also delivering near-term results. While our transformation is far from complete, we have made significant progress and are confident about our future. With that, I\u2019d like to hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris? Kris Newton : We will now open the call for Q&A. Please be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to one question so we can get to as many people as possible. Thanks for your cooperation. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citi. Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Hi, this is Justin on for Jim Suva. I just had a quick question in terms of the overall linearity in the quarter. If you could just talk about -- a little bit about the demand, was it deteriorating, stabilizing, or improving and how is the demand looking now in May? Is it shaping up in the same sort of format, is it deteriorating or stabilizing? Thank you. George Kurian : First of all the demand for enterprise IT is shaped by the global macro environment and we did see the effects of an uncertain macro in certain parts of the world. At the same time when you compare Q4 with Q3 were the last month of our Q3 was in January. We saw generally improving environment in Q4. We -- in our business saw accelerating momentum through the end of the quarter and so we feel pleased with the progress we've made through the quarter and as we finished. Kris Newton : Thanks. Ron Pasek : Just a reminder, we were back end loaded in Q4 reflecting that demand. Kris Newton : Thanks. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital Markets. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, guys. This is [indiscernible] calling on behalf of Amit. I just had a question about your product gross margins. They fell below [technical difficulty] for the first time in quite a while. Can you just talk about the discounting and promotional activity? Is it geared toward -- more towards some of your mature revenues or strategic revenues? George Kurian : No, we ran a couple of promos for strategic products, mainly flash and cDOT. Those ran most of the year. We also had some significant discounting across-the-board, which is just what you see in the market today. The promotions are essentially to help our customers offset the cost of the need to migrate to clustered ONTAP. We\u2019ve seen good results from the promotion. We\u2019ve also seen progress with our All-Flash-Array momentum as we've outlined on the call. We tend to continue those promotions, but for offsetting the impact of those promotions with cost take out activities on both the cost of revenue, as well as the cost of service infrastructure. Kris Newton : Thanks. We will take the next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Louis Miscioscia from CLSA. Louis Miscioscia : Sure. Can you talk about the industry headwinds that you\u2019re running into. You mentioned in your opening comments that you are actually seeing more business shift to the cloud. I assume that when it goes there, you end up not having the majority of the storage sales from that, especially it's obviously going to AWS and maybe combine that with service flash and software defined storage. Our checks suggest that there is improvement in that area and now you can use software defined storage to pull together all the storage in servers, where before there were islands. So is that also going to be a big competitive threat going forward? Thank you. George Kurian : First of all, we said in the prepared remarks that the majority of the uncertainty in the spending environment is due to the macro not from a secular shift to the cloud. We did not see any sort of substantial trend between Q3 and Q4 in terms of the cloud. In terms of positioning for the cloud, we have substantially improved our own positioning over the course of the year, for us being a serving customers with workloads on the cloud and let me articulate that in three ways. First is the supplier of technology to cloud providers, both people in enterprises building their own cloud as well as service providers building clouds. We've seen strong progress with both our clustered ONTAP offerings, as well as SolidFire that allows us to build both traditional cloud environment as well as next generation clouds. We are also the leader from an enterprise storage and data management technology company without question in the open stack cloud deployments where we\u2019ve seen strong year-on-year growth. In terms of the hyper scalers, our solutions that combine hyper scale are cloud computing environment with our technology like NetApp private storage in our data fabric solutions have seen good growth through the course of the year. Its early, but as we noted we\u2019re winning our share of leading-edge hybrid cloud deployments and are the only enterprise vendor who has the capability to combine a hyper scale our cloud with enterprise data management. Finally, as you note through the course of the year there are several examples of customers that started out on public cloud and decided to either migrate data and storage footprints to on-premises environment and we\u2019re uniquely positions to capture those workloads as they transition either on-prem to the cloud or from the public cloud back on-prem. Kris Newton : Thanks, Lou. Next question? Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox from Cross Research. Steven Fox : Thanks. Good afternoon. On the cost reduction, it sounds like you guys got off to a good start with the plan to exit this fiscal year, $400 million. Can you just help us on the slope of the costs or the shape of the cost reductions from -- for this fiscal year whether we should see a more frontloaded and if there is much difference in that shape between gross and net. And within that gross and net, f there's any discounting that's being factored into the difference. Thank you. Ron Pasek : Yes, you'll see the cost reductions both in COGS and OpEx throughout the year. They will tend to be a little more back end loaded, but they will be throughout year. You should see U.S realigning our go-to-market to the opportunity we see in the marketplace. We are going to be simplifying product offerings which will benefit the entire Company. You'll see us aggregating back-office functions to a shared services model. And we will be doing business process redesign, organization realignment and further the streamlining of our portfolio. So some of things will take a little bit of time. We talked about them last quarter. They\u2019ve been ongoing. You'll see the benefit, to some extent throughout the first quarter and into the second quarter and throughout the year. A - Ron Pase : We're taking it systematically, so that we can permanently and systematically reduce the cost base of the Company; So what we\u2019re really trying to do is not do a short-term action that precludes us from fundamentally reengineering that business process, so that it can be permanently reduce to a lower cost basis. So as Ron said, we\u2019re being thoughtful and deliberate, but you will see us make progress on the 400 million that we committed to. We\u2019ve also -- already demonstrated progress this past quarter and we're taken it on systematically and rigorously. Kris Newton : Thanks, Steve. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski from Goldman Sachs. Simona Jankowski : Yes, hi. I wanted to ask you first if you can up quantify how much SolidFire might have contributed to the quarter and what you're expecting for the current quarter? And then in terms of the competitive environment, we saw significant announcements from a bunch of your competitors including EMC, Pure and Nimble during the quarter. So just wanted to see what your thoughts are on the competitive environment in response. George Kurian : SolidFire was immaterial during the course of this quarter. We felt good about the progress we\u2019ve made and you'll see us continue to execute our integration plan focused on the team, the product roadmap, as well as the go-to-market. From our internal benchmarks we are ahead of our plan, so we feel good on the start with SolidFire. In terms of the All-Flash-Array segment, UPS not only demonstrate leadership with the progress we've made this quarter where we\u2019re clearly outpacing both traditional vendors as well as the pure your plate All-Flash-Array start up. Without question representing the maturity of our portfolio and the ability to address the largest part of the flash market opportunity as customers transition mainstream storage environment from legacy SAN architectures to modern flash-based storage system. As a simple data point, the attach rate of fiber channel environments in our all-flash configuration is three times higher than in our disc base configurations representing without question the fact that we\u2019re gaming share at the expense of the legacy fiber channel vendors. And stay tuned. In a few weeks we will have exciting announcements as I mentioned on the call with both SolidFire and ONTAP 9, announcing major progress and expanded leadership in the fastest-growing category in storage. Kris Newton : Thanks, Simona. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Kelleher from D. A. Davidson. Mark Kelleher : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to follow-up on the operating margin guidance. I think you said 10% for Q1. That seems to be a pretty significant step down sequentially. You talked about some cuts and some savings that you made and your reduction in force, gross margins are going to kind of hold in there. Can you just give some detail on where there is some negative leverage going into Q1 in the operating lines? Thanks. George Kurian : Yes, the only real negative is we having SolidFire in there now that's in the run rate drawbacks. We do have a little lower revenue in Q1, but we did get significant savings from the reduction we had in Q4. It benefited the quarter significantly about $50 million for run rate in Q1. Mark Kelleher : Okay. Thanks. Kris Newton : Thanks, mark. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner from Deutsche Bank. Sherri Scribner : Hi. Thanks. I just wanted to ask it looks like the strategic solutions growth decelerated from 26% last quarter to somewhere around 15% this quarter. Just wanted to know what was driving that and thinking about fiscal 17 I think you said that strategic solutions growth should offset the declines in the mature solutions, so does that suggest flat revenue, trying to understand how to think about that things. George Kurian : First of all the growth of strategic solutions accelerated through the quarter. If you saw the shipments of clustered ONTAP, the unit shipments were up substantially 80% year-on-year. And if you do the math 16% growth in aggregate on sequential -- on a sequential basis in strategic revenue. The All-Flash segment as well shows us accelerating our All-Flash-Array shipments and the growth rate continued to be strong of larger cloud footprints. So in aggregate we are actually very confident about the strategic solutions. We saw accelerating momentum with them in Q4 and through the course of the quarter and we look forward to over the course of fiscal 17 having strategic solutions more offset the decline in the mature category. Kris Newton : Thanks, Sherri. Next question. Operator : Thank you and our next question comes from the line of James Kisner from Jefferies. Jason North : Hi. This is Jason north for James. Following up on the last question, as you look into Q1, are you expecting mature solutions that declined to lesson year-over-year or conversely do you think she solutions could increase year-over-year to get here at the midpoint of your revenue guidance. Thanks. George Kurian : The mature solutions are do not expect mature solutions to be substantially different than the FAS we had. It will not increase as a percentage of our business and will continue to be a smaller part of our business from a go-forward basis. So we expect through the course of next year that strategic solutions will maintain their growth trajectory and will be an ever-increasing part of both product revenue and total Company revenue. Kris Newton : Thanks, Jason. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski from Piper Jaffray. Andrew Nowinski : Great. Thank you. I just wanted to ask a question on the FlexPod. So Cisco obviously launched their own hyper conversion platform called HyperFlex and Nimble's partnering with Cisco now, so it seems like the revenue opportunity for FlexPod might be getting a little bit smaller. I guess how do you view the opportunity with Cisco, and then more broadly speaking, how do you view NetApp's position in the broader hyper conversion market relative to leaders like Nutanix and EMC's VNX rail? Thanks. George Kurian : Let me address those with -- those are two questions, I\u2019d ask that you just ask a single question, but on FlexPod we just announced several new exciting innovations that we've been working on with Cisco for a while and All-Flash configuration of the FlexPod that allows us to improve the performance and latency of traditional convert systems, as well as FlexPod systems by over 20X. We've announced the FlexPod lifecycle automation solution which is a capability that allows us to provide a highly automated deployment model for FlexPod customers that allows you to shrink the time from receiving equipment to serving data to less than an hour. This is competitive with the hyper converged solutions that are shipping in the market. And third with SolidFire we get the extreme ease of deployment, the simple scalability and the ability to offer through the use of solutions like OpenStack, the benefits of hyper converged technology, meaning rapid time to value and ease of deployment and administration without the compromises that hyper converged solutions offer. Kris Newton : Thanks, Andrew. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall from J.P. Morgan. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, guys. This is RK [ph] on behalf of Rod. Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations to Ron. My question is around services revenue growth. Now that has been deteriorating through the course of FY16. Could you help us think about that going forward? Would it just continue to deteriorate at a lag to product revenue growth? George Kurian : So, we still are increasing our install base, therefore are increasing our services revenue. We saw a large increase as well in deferred revenue this quarter, little over $200 million. So I think even though you have mature business declining it's still adding to the install base as our strategic solutions, as well what you see is the services business is becoming more profitable. So, I think, I don\u2019t know if I answered your question, but I think we don't see that being a drag on the business. Kris Newton : Thanks, RK [ph]. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian White from Hamilton. Brian White : Hey, George. I'm wondering if you could give us some color on the growth rate NetApp had with the hyper scale cloud providers in fiscal '16 and some type of range around a percentage of revenue. Obviously, this is a big theme and it's having an impact on the industry. So how did you grow in fiscal '16? Thanks. George Kurian : These are -- we are not going to break out numbers. They\u2019re small numbers, but we had good growth of the solutions that connect to the hyper scale providers. Essentially we\u2019ve NetApp private storage that provides customers with secure data management capabilities and allow you to use the compute clouds of hyper scale providers. We have AltaVault that provides backup as a service to the cloud providers where essentially a customer can use a cloud provider as a repository and do use it as an alternative to on-prem backup solutions, and we have cloud ONTAP. All of those had substantial growth, but on small numbers. We actually measure the impact of those solutions in the way they allow us to beat competitors that are building closed proprietary stacks and we\u2019ve seen as I said on the call, we had substantial wins in several parts of the world where our open data fabric strategy allowing people to combine public hybrid clouds with on premises data centers gives us a strategic advantage over people who are building proprietary clouds. Kris Newton : Thanks, Brian. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Milunovich from UBS. John Roy : Thank you. Hey, it's John Roy for Steve. So real quick. On the outlook for flash pricing and the upcoming 16 terabyte SSDs, is that going to help you guys with margins or is that something you think you are going to have to pass through to customers? How does the pricing environment kind of look going forward? Ron Pasek : First of all, we feel good about the progress that these promotions have enabled us to achieve. We\u2019ve gained channel mind share. We\u2019ve essentially come from a long way back in the flash market to rapidly outpacing everybody, big and small in that market into a leadership position. And we\u2019ve enabled our installed base of clustered ONTAP customers to move up -- ONTAP customers to move to a clustered operating system. We have those promotions in place. We intend to continue them, but we do have control for how long we run them first of all. The second is as we introduce the next versions of ONTAP, we will continue to expand our leadership in enterprise data management, as well as introduce particular patent pending storage efficiency techniques that allow us to be more cost-effective than we have been so far. And you'll see us take advantage of that by improving the margins over time. George Kurian : Right now I think you should assume the margins are neutral. They\u2019re really not any different. Kris Newton : All right. Thanks, John. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Maynard Um from Wells Fargo. Unidentified Analyst : Yes, it's Manjal on behalf of Maynard. My question was, if we look at strategic revenue that's 61% in Q4, for the full-year, it was 53%. So it's already more than half of your business. Then why do we view fiscal '17 still as a transition year? And is it -- should we be looking at the All-flash-Array as a better -- the mix of All-Flash-Array as a better gauge to see when your top line condense [ph] around? And then just a clarification, do you still expect 2% growth from SolidFire in fiscal '17? Ron Pasek : So first of all, with regard to the comment about being a transition year. It\u2019s a transition year with regard to product revenue where the absolute dollar decline of the mature category is still a drag in fiscal '17. 61% is not a 100% yet, right and so it will be a drag until we transition the mature business to where it's a far less --far important part of our business. In terms of SolidFire, the outlook for SolidFire is the same as that as we communicated last quarter, which is about 2%. Kris Newton : Thanks. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty from Morgan Stanley. Jerry Lou : Hey, this is Jerry Lou for Katy. Can you guys talk about for the first quarter of 2017, what's driving that gross margin improvement sequentially? Is it less discounting? Is it sustainable or is it product mix and other things? Thanks. George Kurian : Its mainly product mix within products and then to some extent the products and services piece too. Kris Newton : Thanks. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers from Stifel. Andy Shin : Hey, this is Andy Shin on for Aaron. Thanks for taking the question. So, I think I heard you guys say that product gross margins were lower, just due to promotions to incentivize customers to switch over to cDOT, but I'm curious why didn't you see relatively more of the installed base upgrade to cDOT versus the 26% you reported and basically, what percentage of that installed base is at risk of leaving NetApp? George Kurian : So let me answer that question in a couple of ways, right. First of all, the total installed base of 7-Mode systems and clustered ONTAP systems is growing. So our install base is not declining, it's actually growing and clustered ONTAP is growing as a percentage of that. The installed base is a very large number, so even 26% of that installed base is actually a substantial number. We have run promotions through the course of the year to enable customers to transition from 7-Mode to clustered ONTAP as we noted about 1,300 customers accelerating through the course of the year decided to move forward from 7-Mode to clustered ONTAP. The percentage of the install base number that you see sometimes lags the point at which they actually decide to convert, because we have to see that show up in our reporting system. We also see as they migrate that some of those smaller systems get replaced potentially by fewer larger clustered ONTAP systems, so the percentage of systems under clustered ONTAP actually represent -- under represent sometime the total value of the systems that we\u2019ve transitioned. In terms of the overall outlook for clustered ONTAP, we continue to stay focused on the total percentage of our installed base, look like total percentage is shipments and as you see the percentage of shipment is now very much clustered ONTAP, 85% of shipments of the factory and capacity under management, which is now close to 40%. Kris Newton : Thanks. Next question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from -- is a follow-up from the line of Lou Miscioscia from CLSA. Louis Miscioscia : How did I know this was going to happen? When you look at the flash marketplace, do you think that actually, due to the dynamics of flash there will actually be an upward cycle from it, or are you seeing most customers just actually replacing their obviously spinning disc drives or their hybrid drives with flash as the environment comes around? George Kurian : I think we see, first of all, the flash market transitioning from a place where it was essentially a performance used case to one where it replaces performance drives, meaning SaaS drives in the market. As customers make that transition, what they really want in the sort of the majority move is they want the enterprise data management features and how they choose to use it can be one of three ways. The first is Greenfield where for new deployments of enterprise applications they choose to deploy in All-Flash configuration as opposed to a hybrid or disc based configurations. The second could be a retrofit of an existing architecture where in the case of clustered ONTAP we're able to give people a completely transparent way to upgrade a disc drive system to an All-Flash system until you\u2019ve got temporal needs or need for additional performance at a particular point in the season you can do that very, very easily with us. And the third as we\u2019ve noted, is All-Flash systems are the new SAN configuration and we have replaced in customer after customer traditional fiber channel frame arrays from our incumbent competitors with All-Flash storage systems. Kris Newton : Thanks, Lou. Next question. Operator : Thank you. And that concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to NetApp for any closing comments. George Kurian : Thank you for your attendance on the call this afternoon. In closing, let me reiterate my confidence in NetApp's potential. We're committed to fundamental change and remain sharply focused on the execution of our three key priorities. Pivot to growth with our differentiated portfolio of strategic solutions, reduce costs, improve speed and focus by streamlining our business, and a robust capital allocation plan that includes shareholder returns and investment for the long-term growth of the business. We are building on a lot of positives. Our data fabric strategy is aligned with our customers, strategic IT imperatives. The strategic solutions are greater than 60% of product revenue and growing well. We have a large and growing install base and we saw accelerating customer momentum in Q4. And in the coming weeks, we will further advance our leadership position in flash and the next generation data center with exciting ONTAP and SolidFire innovations. I\u2019m confident in our potential and I\u2019m excited to have new leaders on Board. FY17 will be a year of transition. We expect that the growth of strategic solutions will outpace the declines in mature, returning the Company to growth in fiscal year '18. I look forward to speaking with you all again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect. Everyone have a good evening.",

You joined the NetApp First Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference maybe recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host Vice President of Investor Relations Ms. Kris Newton. Ma\u2019am, you may begin. Kris Newton : Hello, and thank you for joining us on our Q1 fiscal year 2017 earnings call. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian and CFO, Ron Pasek. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com along with the earnings release, our financial tables and guidance, a historical supplemental data table and a non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation. As a reminder, during today\u2019s call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the second quarter, our expectations regarding future revenue growth, improved profitability, including cash flow and shareholder returns, our expectations about our ability to drive operational and financial performance, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. Such statements reflect our best judgment based on factors currently known to us and are being made as of today. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons, including the macroeconomic and IT spending environment, our ability to successfully pivot to the growth areas of the market and enable customer migrations to our strategic solutions, our ability to expand our operating margin, our ability to reduce our cost structure, streamline the business and improve efficiency within the planned timeframe, and our ability to continue our capital allocation strategy and invest in strategic opportunities. Please refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC, specifically our most recent Forms 10-Q, our Form 10-K for fiscal year 2016 and our current reports on Form 8-K, all of which can also be found on our website. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to George. George Kurian : Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. In Q1 fiscal year 2017, our focus on the disciplined execution of our strategy yielded solid results on both the top and bottom-line. We delivered revenue of above the midpoint of our prior guidance range with both operating margin and EPS above our previous guidance. Over the course of the quarter, we strengthened our position in flash and hybrid cloud, while continuing to transform our business to operate more efficiently and to lower costs. We\u2019re clearly making progress, but still have work to do as we operate in the low growth macroeconomic and IT spending environment. We are controlling what we can and are increasingly confident in our ability to execute as we streamline the business and pivot to the growth areas of the market. We believe these actions will return the company to revenue growth with improved profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns. Let me remind you of our key priorities in delivering on this commitment. First, we are executing on our data fabric strategy and the strategic solutions that form the foundation of how we enable customer success in the data powered digital era. Second, we are substantially reducing cost and systematically streamlining our operations while maintaining our ability to deliver innovation and lead the market. And third, we\u2019re committed to a robust capital allocation program, which includes a combination of share repurchases, dividends and investment for the long-term growth of the business. I'll start with an update on the first priority. Ron will update you on the other two. Our strategic solutions aligned to customer's top IT priorities. This alignment drives our confidence in our ability to lead in the fastest growing segments of the market. In the first quarter, strategic solutions represented 61% of net product revenue and grew 24% year-over-year. Conversely, net product revenue from our mature solutions declined at 24% from Q1 a year ago. As expected, the impact of the declines in mature solutions are lessening which will allow the growth of our strategic solutions to reaccelerate the business and return NetApp to moderated revenue growth in fiscal year '18. Our customers are transforming their IT organizations for success in the data powered digital era. They are prioritizing investments to modernize their data centers to lower costs, increase simplicity and agility, extract more value from their data and integrate cloud resources with on-premises environments. Clustered Data ONTAP replaces legacy frame array environments to deliver next generation enterprise storage for efficient management of data growth and service provider like flexibility across flash, disk and cloud footprint. We continue to gain new customers and migrate existing customers to Clustered ONTAP. Clustered ONTAP was deployed on 82% of fast systems shipped in Q1, up from 65% a year ago. We saw continued strong customer demand with unit shipments of Clustered ONTAP systems growing 35% year-over-year. The installed base of Clustered ONTAP in 7-Mode systems continues to grow in total and Clustered ONTAP is now running on 32% of that growing install base. We're building on this strength with the newest generation of ONTAP which further simplifies customer's ability to deploy modern enterprise data center and hybrid cloud environments. Introduced in Q1, ONTAP 9 builds the foundation for a data fabric, bridging new and traditional data center architectures, making it easy to manage and move data where it's needed across flash, disk and cloud resources. Customers can choose the architecture of their choice, engineered and converged systems, software defined storage or cloud, all with industry leading efficiency, performance and density for flash environments. No other storage solution offers customers this range of capability, flexibility and investment protection. Also introduced in Q1, ONTAP Select, a scalable software defined storage solution helps customers achieve their business objectives by bringing together the ability to deploy storage with cloud like agility and granular capacity scaling, with the proven features of the industry's number one storage operating system. ONTAP Select offers the flexibility to deploy ONTAP on commodity servers with the customer's choice of Hypervisors. It simplifies operations and lowers training requirements by providing consistent management across all ONTAP data storage, whether on-premises or on the cloud. Flash plays an important role in IT transformations as customers seek to gain a competitive edge through greater speed, responsiveness and value from key business applications as well as efficiencies through consolidation and lower power requirements. Customers are replacing hard disk installations with flash, making flash the de facto standard for new on premises deployments. In this transition from disk to flash, customers cannot forego enterprise data management and data protection capabilities. With our highly differentiated portfolio of All-Flash-Array offerings, NetApp is uniquely positioned to enable customers to consolidate on to flash and create All-Flash data centers. IDC ranked NetApp number two in the All-Flash-Array market with a significantly higher share than we hold in the overall storage market. Last week we won the flash memory summit best of show for most innovative flash memory customer implementation and swept all six brand leadership categories for all flash NAS and unified NAS SAN arrays in the 2016 brand leader survey. Our advantages in this market are reflected in the continued strong growth of our All-Flash-Array business, which grew approximately 385% year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run rate of almost $775 million, inclusive of All-Flash FAS, EF and SolidFire product and services. The majority of this growth was again driven by high demand for the All-Flash FAS. In Q1 we further enhanced the All-Flash FAS with increased speed and data efficiency capabilities, guaranteeing 3X performance improvement over hard disk arrays and four to one data reduction. NetApp was first to market with 15 terabyte flash drives, which in combination with storage efficiency features in ONTAP 9 delivers a flash optimized enterprise class storage platform that is the best in the industry for mixed workload consolidation. We are displacing our competitors' legacy SAN frame array architectures with the All-Flash FAS. It enabled us to break into a large U.S. based healthcare company, which had been a decade long competitor stronghold. We replaced the competitor's SAN infrastructure for the customer's mission critical SAP environment. The All-Flash FAS beat out the incumbent and a newer All-Flash competitor on performance, features and resiliency. Not only we'll be able to reduce the data center floor space required for this workload by 95%, we were also able to provide the customer a path to the hybrid cloud. The All-Flash FAS addresses requirements for next generation enterprise storage for customers who want to improve existing infrastructure and processes. For enterprises and service providers who are building multi-channel public and private clouds, SolidFire delivers a storage solution that is operationally simple, able to deliver predictable services and scale as services need to grow. It's unique web scale style architecture enables customers to easily build best in class service environments. In Q1 we delivered new SolidFire innovations across software, hardware and systems along with the new model for purchasing storage, FlashForward capacity licensing. The latest version of the SolidFire element OS software offers a more intuitive user interface and a robust implantation of VMware Virtual Volumes for VMware operations, including native per virtual machine quality of service. The latest SolidFire platform, which doubles performance and capacity can be easily added to existing clusters, allowing customers to rapidly deploy the newest flash technology without forklift upgrades or controller swaps. FlashForward Capacity Licensing unbundled storage software from hardware in an efficient software purchasing model with perpetual transferable and pulled enterprise-wide licensing. IT transformations are also enabling customers to accelerate time to market, improve customer satisfaction, drive innovation and gain a competitive edge by getting more out of their data. NetApp data management solutions accelerate third platform analytic solutions by delivering an open, scalable enterprise grade platform for building customers critical data legs. To enable the real-time enterprise, customers can run analytics in place on existing data stores without copying or having to ensure data consistency across silos. For customers who want to leverage the nearly endless compute on demand capabilities of the cloud to accomplish cost effective data analysis, NetApp data fabric cloud sync service provides a simple automated way to get data into Amazon Web Services, run the desired cloud analytic service and the data back to where it is needed, whether on premises or in the cloud. We showcased cloud sink at AWS Summit last week and you can expect to hear more about how we empower customers to leverage cloud resources and integrate them with their existing IT investments over the course of this fiscal year. Our data fabric strategy enables data management that seamlessly connects disparate systems, software stacks, clouds and data centers. We give our customers the ability to manage, secure and protect their data across flash, disk, public and private cloud resources, all at the scale needed to accommodate the exponential data growth of the digital world. More and more customers are telling us that they choose NetApp because we enable their cloud strategies by providing data portability and cloud integration. Coupled with our industry leading next generation enterprise and web scale storage solutions, we're helping our customers transform for success in the data powered digital era. We accomplished a lot in Q1, our focus on disciplined execution and pivot to the growth segments of the market is yielding results and starting to change the trajectory of our business. We introduced substantial innovation across our portfolio that helps our customers as they transform to modernize their data centers to lower costs, increase simplicity, extract more value from their data and integrate cloud resources with their own premises environments, and we will introduce more exciting innovations at our Insight User Conference in Las Vegas next month. We're making progress, but we still have more work ahead of us to return the Company to long-term growth and to our target operating margin. We are streamlining the business and reducing our cost base to position us for future success by allowing investments in strategic opportunities, while accelerating our ability to deliver shareholder value in the form of improved profitability and cash flow. Our first quarter results provide early indicators that our strategy is working and I am very confident in the NetApp team\u2019s ability to successfully evolve the company. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ron to walk through our Q1 financial performance and expectations for the second quarter. Ron Pasek : Thanks George. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you that we will be referring to non-GAAP numbers today. Also please note that year-over-year compares are against a 14-week quarter we had in Q1 of fiscal 2016. With that let\u2019s get started. We executed well in the first quarter and overall are pleased with our results. Q1 net revenues of $1.29 billion declined approximately 3% year-over-year and were within our guidance range. Excluding the approximate $40 million benefit to software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenue from the 14th week we had in Q1 of last year, net revenues were roughly flat year-over-year. Product revenue was $660 million and for the first time in several quarters was essentially flat on a year-over-year basis. As we\u2019ve discussed, we expect the growth of our strategic solutions to improve our overall product revenue growth trajectory over the course of fiscal 2017. Though we still have a lot of work to do, the product revenue results are good indication of the progress we\u2019re making here. The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenue of $634 million, were down approximately 6% year-over-year due to the extra week in Q1 fiscal 2016. Gross margin was 62.4% and within our guidance range. Product gross margin of 46.7% was flat sequentially. Although product gross margin remains below where we'd ultimately like it to be, we feel good about the stabilization. On a year-over-year basis, product gross margin was down about 4.5 points. Software maintenance gross margin was relatively flat year-over-year, while hardware maintenance and other services gross margin increased just under 4 points year-over-year. Operating expenses of $652 million decreased 13% year-over-year. This decline reflects the early results of our transformation efforts, as well as the benefit of the return to a typical 13-week quarter, partially offset by SolidFire. Operating margin of 12.1% was above our previous guidance range. As I discussed on our last earnings call, aligning our cost structure with the opportunities in front of us is my top priority and completely within our control. Although, we have made progress on this front, we will continue to take additional steps throughout the year to permanently lower our cost structure including, but not limited to headcount reductions and continue to drive greater efficiencies across the business. We will continue to communicate specifics as these savings are realized. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.6%. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 282 million. EPS of $0.46 was $0.07 over the high-end of our prior guidance range, reflecting lower operating expenses, higher revenue and a benefit of our share repurchases. Our cash and balance sheet metrics remain healthy. We closed Q1 with $4.4 billion in cash in short-term investments with approximately 13% held by our domestic entities. We repaid the SolidFire loan in the first quarter of global profits. We remain deeply committed to completing by the end of May 2018, the remaining balance of our share repurchase program that we announced in February 2015. In Q1 we repurchased $175 million of our stock, and paid approximately $53 million in cash dividends. Today we also announced our next cash dividend of $0.19 per share, which will be paid on October 26, 2016 to shareholders of record as of the close of business October 7, 2016. Deferred and finance unearned services revenue was up 8% year-over-year. Inventory turns increased to 24 and DSO was 35 days. Q1 cash flow from operations was approximately $228 million versus $129 million in Q1 a year ago. We generated strong free cash flow of $192 million in the quarter. Representing about 15% of net revenues, free cash flow grew over 100% year-over-year. Now to guidance, as George discussed we are aggressively pivoting to the growth areas of the market while at the same time transforming the Company in order to streamline the business, drive greater efficiency and rapidly address the changing market. As we've outlined today, we executed well against our plans in Q1 and are encouraged by the early signs of progress that we're seeing. While we still have a lot of work to do, we remain confident in our ability to continue to execute against the plans we outlined for fiscal 2017 on our prior earnings call. For Q2, we expect net revenues to range between $1.265 billion and $1.415 billion, which at the mid-point implies a sequential increase of 4% and 7% decrease year-over-year and a difficult compare. We expect Q2 consolidated gross margins of approximately 62% to 63% and operating margins of approximately 13% to 14%. And finally we expect earnings per share for the second quarter to range from approximately $0.51 to $0.56 per share. With that I'll hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris Newton : We'll now open the call for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Operator? Operator : Thank you, Ma'am. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rod Hall of JPMorgan. Your question please. Rod Hall : I just wanted to ask about the cDOT conversion, because I ask about it every quarter and it seems like you made good progress this quarter at 32% of the install base. At what point do you -- do you think this just continues to grow linearly towards or how do you see this progressing? Should we just assume it continues to grow kind of at the rate it has been the last few quarters? And then I also wanted to ask about gross margins. By your comments there I assume that you're seeing pricing relatively stable. You don't see any issues as you move to cDOT or anything like that with pricing. So if could just kind of comment on that as well, it would be helpful? George Kurian : First of all, I'd just say that we're pleased with the progress on cDOT penetration of our install base and new customers. I think when you think about our install base, it's a very large install base that we've built up over 20 years and its growing and so the percentage of systems that we represent is a very large number. The cDOT conversions are lumpy. They go up and down. The pace at which they move are tied to customers' IT spending and their readiness for conversion. In aggregate you're seeing us continue to progress the conversion of the install base. I would just say that I would not -- we're planning the business around any particular quarter-on-quarter model. I think in aggregate we're pleased with the progress and we continue to want to get our customers over the clustered ONTAP and you're seeing that. In terms of gross margins, I think a couple of things. The first is the value proposition of All Flash FAS clustered ONTAP are showing up in the differentiation and customer acquisition and the shipments that we are delivering to customers. The gross margin model that we showed last quarter to this quarter has stayed stable and the market remains competitive, but we differentiated technology in the market as well as we outlined in our cost focus, we continue to do work in the supply chain on both of cost of goods sold as well the operating structure of the Company to support that model. Ron Pasek : I think I'd remind you what I last quarter as well. Discounting is a function of what we're seeing in the marketplace plus product promotions we're running and so we're still doing some of those but deemphasizing certain ones and emphasizing others. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Your question please. Simona Jankowski : I just wanted to confirm that I heard you correctly, that the installed base is still growing and related to that, would you expect your services business to return to growth in future quarters? George Kurian : The install base is growing. That's correct Simona. It's a very large number and it's growing. I think in terms of the services business, the first thing I'd just tell you is the year-over-year compare was from a 14-week quarter last year to a 13-week quarter this year, and if you adjust for that, the services business is essentially flat. If you look at our deferred revenue, it shows strength reflecting the nature of the long-term contracts that we have with customers, as well as the strategic value and the business criticality of our solutions. Simona Jankowski : And so you expect that to be -- just clarifying -- you expect that to grow in future quarters versus being flat or plus or minus? George Kurian : Yes, as the install base grows, that services revenue will grow as well. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Nolan of Robert Baird. Your question please. Jason Nolan : I wanted to ask, the mix that's in there, I assume a lot of that is All-Flash FAS versus SolidFire and E Series. If you could confirm that first. And then ask about competitive dynamic. It seems pretty intense right now and I guess my question is why is AFA so much more intense than the traditional storage business? George Kurian : First of all, the progress we've seen this quarter reflects -- the biggest part of it reflects continued success with All-Flash FAS. We've been encouraged by the progress with SolidFire as well, with new customer acquisitions led by the NetApp sales team. But as we had outlined in prior statements, SolidFire today is immaterial to the revenue. It's consistent with the plan that we've laid out for you, and we're encouraged by the early signs of progress. In terms of the All-Flash Array market, I think what we see is that the larger system vendors who have now integrated All-Flash offerings as part of their enterprise grade storage and models continue to get the lion's share of enterprise storage footprints. I think the progress we've made with our All-Flash arrays reflects the differentiation of our clustering technology, the storage efficiency, the performance and reliability of our offerings. And so we feel very, very good about where we are. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Katy Huberty : U.S. public sector revenue grew this quarter. Are you starting to see larger deals and do you expect that to continue as we go into the fiscal year end for that segment? Thanks. George Kurian : Thanks Katy. We are encouraged by the progress with U.S. public sector. I'll just tell you there was no specific pattern that we noticed. We also continue to monitor the U.S. public sector spending patterns as we head into the November election season. So we feel good about our position in the market, the competitiveness for offerings as well as progress we're making with some of the agencies, but we'll continue to monitor the sector as we head into the November season. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Suva of Citigroup. Your question please. Jim Suva : I have a housekeeping question for Ron and then may be a strategy or market insight for George. Ron, on the OpEx, specifically the general administrative side, it looks it was kind of at very low levels or multi low levels. Is that level sustainable or is there even more room to get more efficient there or were there some type of benefit that happened this quarter, just for modeling for kind of long term run rate for that why [indiscernible] came down a lot both sequentially and year-over-year, even though year-over-year understand the week, but sequentially it came down a lot too, and compared to history it's really low. And then George, on the insight for the market, any impact to Brexit? Your company had a full month of sales and revenues through the month of July. Did you see any order delays? Did those come back in August or is it creating a little more uncertainty in the UK and how should we think about any impact there that you are seeing. Ron Pasek : Sure Jim. So yeah, with respect to G&A, this is early part of the work we've talked to you about relating to transformation, both in really all the support functions and then some of the line organizations as well. So it is -- some of it did happen a little quicker than we thought and will continue throughout Q2, maybe at not the same levels, but it is a permanent reduction to the levels of G&A and part of our strategy. George Kurian : With regard to Brexit, I think both in terms of the commercial impact as well as the FX impact to our business, they were immaterial this past quarter. It's too early to tell. And so we monitor in discussions with our large customers but we didn't see anything material to our business. Kris Newton : Thank you. And just as reminder, if everyone could keep it to one question, so we can get to as many of you as possible. We'd appreciate it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi guys. This is [indiscernible] calling in for Amit. I wanted to go back on the product gross margin question. It's been below 50% for the second consecutive quarter. There has been discounting and promotional activity. But can you just talk about how the margin profiles of strategic and material product businesses might differ, essentially as a mix of strategic increases? George Kurian : There is no material difference between strategic and mature in terms of product gross margin. In terms of our overall gross margin, as we said, as part of our focus on cost management, we continue to take a hard look at every category cost of goods sold, as well as the cost of goods on the services side. And so we continue to work to maintain our gross margins in aggregate in the ranges that we've guided to. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi of Lake Street Capital. Your question please. Eric Martinuzzi : Yes. As I look at the strategic product growth area, you exited FY 2016, I think it was a 21% rate and you put up Q1 here at about a 26% rate. So that acceleration, obviously terrific execution. As we look out for the remainder of the year, is this something that is sustainable? You talked about a difficult comp in Q2, but I don\u2019t know that I have the level of detail in between the two segments between strategic and mature. But is that acceleration in FY 2017 sustainable? George Kurian : So question as strategic revenue grew 24% in Q1 and we feel that we are encouraged by that growth rate year-on-year. It was 14% in Q4 year-on-year. So we feel good about the process in the strategic solutions. As I said, we think that as the mature solutions become a smaller percentage of our business, they become less of a headwind in terms of overall revenue growth. And our plan is to get product revenue back to growth at some point this year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers of Stifel. Your line is open. Aaron Rakers : I wanted to take a longer term view and understand some of the things that you\u2019ve done here recently for the quarter. How should we think about your ONTAP select, as well as the purchasing model of FlashForward for your SolidFire solutions? Or put another way, how you guys thinking about the model implications from software defined storage, or rather that de-bundling between software and hardware going forward? George Kurian : Let me take that from a customer perspective, and then Ron can comment on the financial implications. First of all, from a customer perspective, we think that the value of differentiated storage and data management capabilities as we\u2019ve always said is software and we have among the best storage and data management platforms in the industry without question for traditional enterprise with Clustered ONTAP and for web scale enterprise with SolidFire. So we feel very good about our position in those markets. The software value of those products protect and differentiate gross margin. ONTAP select is an offering that we\u2019ve made available to customers, who have the engineering capability to integrate software with systems for specific deployments. I think the range of customers who have that level of engineering capability is small. And so we think that the preponderant majority of our business will continue to say integrated systems. With regard to SolidFire's FlashForward licensing model, it essentially allows customers to simply procurement of software so that they can build the pool of storage that is enterprise wide and then buy hardware as they need it and integrate it under that software umbrella. Typically, what we have seen with that type of model is that it allows us to get larger footprint sooner in customers as they standardize on SolidFire for a broad range of use cases. Ron Pasek : I'll just add that what you're describing is a way that our customers can't consume our products and we're well aware of the change. It is a very small piece of our business, not material at this point but it's something we do want to accommodate. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from James Kisner of Jefferies. Your line is open. Jason Kisner : So, let\u2019s talk a little bit about working capital. It looks to me like your cash [indiscernible] cycle was hitting a multi-year low. This year you had very strong collection. Just wondering how we should think about DSOs and cash conversion cycle going forward and do you expect free cash flow being in mid-teens as a percent of revenue for the year? George Kurian : So, yes, we benefitted from a huge improvement quarter-to-quarter which is seasonal in DSO. We had a relatively back end loaded quarter in Q4, which had an artificially high effect on DSO. That came back into the norm. It's still -- at 35 it's still five days higher than it was at Q1 a year ago. The other huge benefit to cash conversion was a really low inventory, probably historically low inventory. That's a little bit of an anomaly. It's probably too low. You shouldn't expect that level going forward but it should be an improvement from the prior year. We continue to focus on working capital. It's one of the parts of our transformation efforts. Keenly aware of it. So it is not an accident that these things happen, and we're going to continue to drive it. Operator : Next question comes from Brian Alexander of Raymond James. Your line is open. Bob Hahn : Hi, this is Bob Hahn for Brian. Just a follow-up question for Ron, when you mentioned promotional activity, and mentioned reducing some programs and growing others. Could you be more specific in where you're driving more or less promotional activity, and to what extent you think gross margin pressure is within your control in temporary? Ron Pasek : What I described last quarter were two promotions which are still running. One was on flash and one was on cDOT. Some of those are running at a course, not needed as much anymore. We're looking at additional promotions that I don't want to talk discreetly, they tend to be really important to us at a given time. That's really a function of what's going on in the marketplace. George Kurian : And broad breaststrokes, as we accelerate certain accelerates certain strategic technologies to market, we pivot our focus there with promotions and other things for a period of time, and we brought down on the pieces that are more mature or well penetrated. And I would just continue to think about that as part of our ongoing portfolio management. Operator : The next question comes from Joe Wittine of Longbow Research. Your line is open. Joe Wittine : Maybe just a clarification on the buckets that you're breaking out, appreciate you doing that. What exactly is in the mature bucket at this point? Are customers still adding to legacy ONTAP 7 environments? And then within strategic also, does that -- what chunk of strategic is still -- would someone consider legacy on-prem arrays that are running clustered cDOT? George Kurian : So, mature is essentially the OEM products that include E-Series and are legacy FAS OEM products, 7-Mode systems and add-on hardware. Add-on hardware is equipment that is purchased after an initial configured system sale, for example add-on storage. The strategic solutions include our clustered data ONTAP operating systems, All Flash Arrays the branded E series OnCommand Insight, SolidFire and some of our hybrid cloud solutions. There are customers who are adding on to some of their 7-Mode environments for purposes of business continuity, for purposes of this is an application that I don\u2019t want to migrate to clustered ONTAP, because it's an IT area that they're no longer investing or they feel that their current environment is good and so you see people continuing to add-on in small numbers systems and add-on storage to their 7-Mode footprint. The majority of customers that are deploying new configurations as represented by the percentage of shipments out the door are deploying clustered ONTAP configuration. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Srini Nandury of Summit Redstone. Your question please. Srini Nandury : George, can you talk about the relative growth rates of your All Flash FAS versus the growth rate of EF All Flash series as you currently see? George Kurian : The EF series is focused on a much smaller range of used cases, primarily the performance oriented segment of the market where customers want industry leading performance for specific dedicated environments like databases. All Flash FAS represents the focus for the broadest range of customers who are looking at replacing disk based solutions for general purpose storage environments with All Flash configurations. And SolidFire uses flash based technology to build web scale cloud designs for customers, people that want to replicate what Amazon or Google or Facebook have deployed in their datacenters in their own environments. And so those are three pieces. We think that All Flash FAS and SolidFire will be the majority of the business going forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Milunovich of UBS. Your line is open. Sean Ryan : It's Sean Ryan for Steve. So real quick, looking out the back half of the year on a competitive landscape, what do you kind of see happening with Del EMC? Are you seeing them get more aggrieve, as they combined and what do you think there might happen with HP [indiscernible] services. Are any of these going to change the competitive landscape? George Kurian : Well, first of all, let me say that from a technology perspective, we feel very, very good, we have taken flagship customers from both EMC and HP this past quarter as with our All Flash technology, and we feel that as customers look to build All Flash data centers, we've got a technological lead that is very strong and the road map of both All Flash and hybrid cloud solutions from us is resonating with customers. Every transaction is competitive. And so to the extent that we are displacing competitors in large accounts, these are highly competitive transactions. We think that that nature of competitive dynamic will continue. And so what we're doing on our side is both building differentiated capacities in software as well as dealing with the cost structure of the company, both in COGS and OpEx to allow us to compete effectively in the market. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Kelleher of D. A. Davidson. Your line is open. Mark Kelleher : Just want to talk about your go to market strategy. I noticed your indirect revenue ticked up a few percentage points sequentially. Where is your focus there? Do you have enough -- is there any seasonality to that and do you have enough direct salesforce? Where is your investment being made right now? George Kurian : We have a new leader of our go to market organization, Henri Richard, who is focused on accelerating our penetration and returning product revenue to growth, but the indirect channel is an important strategic asset to NetApp. We work closely with our channel to help them accelerate capabilities into the market for our All-Flash Arrays for cluster data ONTAP as well as for SolidFire. We also had a strong quarter on the OEM side, which is reflected in both the mix of mature as well as the mix of indirect channel. And so we're going to continue to focus on the right mix of direct and indirect and the channels are really important part of our go to market model. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from George Iwanyc of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. George Iwanyc : Thank you for taking my question. So just following up on the OEM strength, is that part of the business stabilizing at this point? Do you expect any growth there? George Kurian : OEM is down substantially from years past; it is still dependent on the business of our end customers. But to the extent that there is material seasonality to that business, it's a smaller percentage of our business this year than it was in the past. I'll just leave it there. George Iwanyc : And just following up. With the incremental improvement that you've seen on the mature product side, do you expect that to continue to be the case as we go through the fiscal year and quarter-over-quarter, the year-over-year pressure eases? George Kurian : Yes, you should continue to see that decline throughout the remainder of this year and probably into next year. It won't go to zero, but the decline will slow as the year progresses and we go into FY 2018. Operator : Next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of Susquehanna. Your line is open. David Ryzhik : This is David Ryzhik for Mehdi. What percent of the growth in cDOT unit shipments is due to All-Flash FAS? And also if you can characterize the adoption rate of cDOT in U.S. public sector as well as by geography? George Kurian : We don't break out the adoption rates by geography. I think in general, we are pleased with the progress of cluster data ONTAP across all our geographies. The largest footprint of our installed base is clearly in North America. And so if you look at the remaining footprint, just because of the size of the footprint, we still have a large number of systems to convert, which we see as opportunity for us to do so over the next few quarters. In terms of the mix of all flash and hybrid, our guidance to our field is to sell the best value solution under the clustered ONTAP umbrella, whether -- a customer wants flash, we sell them flash. If they say I want to continue to do hybrid, we'll sell them hybrid. Our overall goal is to sell our clustered operating system and clustered systems to the broadest range of customers. The all flash systems are growing at a faster rate than hybrid. I\u2019ll just leave it there. Operator : The next question comes from Alex Kurtz of Pacific Crest. Your line is open. Alex Kurtz : Just want to go back to the product, the medium to longer term outlook on product margin. Should we just expect, where you\u2019ve been the last few quarters is where the business is going to be trending, just like more competitive environment, lower volume and that\u2019s really where you guys are going to be tracking over the next, I don\u2019t want to put a specific timeframe on it, but over the maybe next year to year and half, or is there something in the product mix that's coming up, that could really drive that back to near historical levels? George Kurian : Yes. What I tried intimate on my prepared remarks was that we\u2019re not happy with where it. I'd like to see it grow. But to some extent, we can do certain things on the cost side, the offering side, the mix side. But to some extent, it\u2019s a function of the competitive environment. So although, I'd like to have it grow, I can\u2019t tell you for sure that it\u2019s going to happen. You\u2019re right. It's historically at a very low level. It puts pressure on the business model. I\u2019d like to see it\u2019s higher, but I also want to be competitive. Alex Kurtz : And just to clarify one thing. I'd imagine the All-Flash Arrays carry a higher product margin. So how should we interpret that as far as reflecting your overall product margin? Does that mean the other products are being discounted more and that\u2019s the results we\u2019re seeing here? George Kurian : No, I really don\u2019t think you should assume that there is a huge difference in product margin Pre flash and traditional storage. So that\u2019s not what\u2019s going here at all. This is really just a function of the competitive environment. Operator : Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : This is [indiscernible] for Sherri Scribner. I was wondering with the progress you\u2019ve made in the SolidFire integration, is M&A a priority? Can you update us on your capital allocation priorities? Ron Pasek : Yes. So the priorities are very, very clear. We\u2019re prioritizing the share repurchase. We\u2019re on track to make the commitment to be done by May of 2018 on the $2 billion that we outlined. Also the dividend, continue to pay and hopefully we\u2019ll see the dividend. To a far lesser extent, you\u2019ll see us being inquisitive. There are some things out there that we might be interested and they\u2019re not pretty big. There tend to be small IP based acquisitions, but that\u2019s how we think of the capital allocation strategy. George Kurian : We\u2019re focused on bringing SolidFire to the broadest range of our customers through our broadest set of go-to-market partners. We\u2019re pleased with the initial progress. But we have a lot of work to do and so we\u2019re going to see focused on it. Operator : Next question comes from Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your question please. Steven Fox : Just on the operating margin targets that you\u2019ve laid out getting back to the high-teens, hopefully exiting this year and then doing that for the full year next year, if we just think about the controllables around that versus the growth prospects and mix, can you sort of outline the big three, two or three things that would drive margins higher from here? Ron Pasek : Yes. It's mainly -- as you said the cost structure, certainly operating expenses. You should expect to see us make the commitment of, essentially on a run rate basis of being $130 million net lower as we exit at Q4 \u201917 from Q3 \u201916. That is a combination of OpEx mostly and to some extent, COGS. Those are the big efforts we\u2019re making to improve the bottom line to your point, assuming maybe we don\u2019t see top line growth. So the assumption is we'll [indiscernible] margin for the year is 15% to 17% and that's with SolidFire in there. And then what I said was we expect to be around 18% in FY '18 with SolidFire. Steven Fox : And just to clarify one point on mix, it sounds like from everything I've heard on the call that there's not a major mix assumption that has to happen obviously. The strategic business wants to grow but, is there anything we should think of that would be a major swing factor around gross margins going forward? Ron Pasek : No, not at all. Operator : Next question comes from John Lucia of JMP Securities. Your question please. John Lucia : Last quarter you talked about customers acting with caution due to an uncertain macro. I didn't really hear you touch on that much this quarter. I was just wondering if you've seen any improvement in terms of purchasing patterns in the storage market in general? Would just like to get your take on that. George Kurian : The quarter came in line with expectations, and in line with historical linearity. I would say that the macro continues to be uncertain. I don't think that we've seen a fundamental shift in the macro environment. I would say that solid-state storage is clearly seeing interest because of the really quick return on investment, the substantially better total cost of ownership and so people are prioritizing that potentially within their spend envelope. But I think overall from a macro perspective, it's still relatively choppy. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi of Maxim Group. Your question please. Nehal Chokshi : Between the stabilizing product revenue on the year-over-year growth basis, as well as the product gross margins, stabilizing plus 50% of your market value and net cash position, I think you guys are effectively trading at five X fiscal year of free cash flow. So my concern here is that you guys become a prime private equity target, and will you look to return cash to shareholders at an accelerated rate in order to make sure that the long term oriented shareholders are protected from private equity firms basically cherry picking off what is a very attractive asset? George Kurian : I think first of all, we've laid out our plan for the Company, which include driving the strategic solutions to growth. We've said that the mature solutions will become less of a headwind and that is playing out and the quarter is the representation of that playing out. We've optimized the cost structure to continue to deliver favorable set of both free cash flow and operating cash flow metrics that in turn gives us increased confidence that we can support the capital allocation program that we've laid out. We've laid out a capital allocation program that includes dividends, share buybacks and the investment of capitals for strategic activities and we remain committed to that. Operator : Next question comes from Ananda Baruah of Brean Capital. Your line is open. Ananda Baruah : So for probably George and Ron, just staying on the capital allocation topic, if the model plays out guys, sort of 2017 and '18, as you believed that it can and hope that it does, why actually -- I'd love to hear the thinking behind staying committed to the buyback part that you guys have, as the stock would seemingly work higher. So kind of still get it lower levels, but why not pivot some of that capital maybe towards the dividend, as the dividend yield gets lower and stock moves higher. Is that based into your thinking? Then I'd love to hear about it. Because it sounded like Ron, you guys feel pretty committed to the turn of dollar target. And then if you could just sort of -- if there was any -- just a thought process behind hedging yourself to that target, what was sort of the statement alleged to that in the context of the question? Ron Pasek : Yes, sure, it was a comment made certainly before I got here. It's the type of thing our long-term investors want to see. I think of the dividend as something we give people regardless of what's going on. And some investors really to see pay only dividend some months as to only do repurchase. So we do a combination of both and keep both happy. I think your question is good, but at the same time we made the commitment. We're going to follow through on the commitment. Operator : Thank you. And our final question for the session comes from Maynard Um of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : This is Manjar [ph] on behalf of Maynard. Just wanted to clarify, your guidance implies that OpEx will increase sequentially in Q2. So could please confirm that? And how we should think about OpEx in second half and as we exit the fiscal year? Ron Pasek : Yes, you are right. We came in lower than I thought we would in Q1 and so there is a very slight increase to OpEx in Q2 if you the midpoint. As I try to intimate, the cost reductions always come very smoothly. There are other things we spend money on that cause little blips through the quarters. However, in general I think as we exist the rest of the year, you should see the OpEx continue to come down through Q3 and into Q4. Operator : Thank you. I'll turn it back to George for some final remarks. George Kurian : We are pleased with our Q1 results and the clear progress we're making with our strategic solutions, but we still have more work ahead of us, and we remain focused on disciplined execution of our strategy. We're committed to the fundamental change that we outlined with the three key priorities. Let me remind you of them once again. The first one is to pivot to the faster growing parts of a market and align ourselves closely with our customers, business and IT transformation priorities with our focus on the strategic solutions portfolio. The second is to reduce cost by streamlining and improving the efficiency for our business. The third is to support and continue with the robust capital allocation plan that we have, that includes shareholder returns and investment for the long-term growth of the business. We brought a lot of innovation to the market in Q1. You can expect to see even more exciting innovations this year, some of which we'll showcase at our Insight User Conference next month. I look forward to speaking with you all again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : And thank you sir. And thank you ladies and gentlemen for your participation. That does conclude your program. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this call maybe recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference Kris Newton, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. You may begin. Kris Newton : Hello, and thank you for joining us on our Q2 fiscal year 2017 earnings call. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian and CFO, Ron Pasek. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com along with the earnings release, our financial tables and guidance, a historical supplemental data table and a non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation. As a reminder, during today\u2019s call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the third quarter, our expectations regarding future revenue growth and improved profitability including cash flow and shareholder returns, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons, including the macroeconomic and IT spending environment, our ability to successfully pivot to the growth areas of the market, to gain market share, to expand our operating margin, to reduce our cost structure, and to continue our capital allocation strategy. Please also refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC, specifically our most recent Forms 10-Q, our Form 10-K for fiscal year 2016 and our current reports on Form 8-K, all of which can also be found on our website. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to George. George Kurian : Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Our focus on the disciplined execution again yielded solid results on the top and bottom-lines. Our second quarter fiscal year 2017 revenue was as the midpoint of our prior guidance range with both operating margin and earnings per share above our previous guidance. And we expanded our innovation in our industry leading flash and hybrid cloud solutions during the quarter. These results are clear evidence of our ability to execute, while we streamline the business and pivot to the growth areas of the market.  As you've heard from us before we have three priorities to deliver on our commitment to return the company to revenue growth with improved profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns. First, we are executing our data fabrics strategy and delivering this strategic solutions that create the foundation for how we enabled customer success. Second, we are permanently lowering our cost structure and streamlining operations while maintaining our ability to innovate. And third, we are continuing our robust capital allocation program, which includes a mix of share buy backs, dividends and investment for the long-term growth of the business. I'll begin with an update on our first priority. Our strategic solutions are aligned to our customer's top IT imperatives and position us to lead in the new era of IT. In Q2, strategic solutions comprised 62% of net product revenue, growth was relatively flat against a tough compare in Q2 fiscal year 2016, but grew 10% sequentially, an indication that we continue to gain attraction in customer environments. Net product revenue from our mature solutions declined at 29% year-over-year. We expect that over the course of this fiscal year, the headwinds from mature solutions will lessen allowing the growth of the strategic solutions to return the company to moderated revenue growth in fiscal year 2018. As you saw in the Q3 guidance included in our press release we expect this shift to begin delivering growth in the second half of this fiscal year. Much like us, our customers need to drive efficiency in the mature parts of their businesses while adding flexibility to capture new business opportunities, out execute the competition and grow revenue. To achieve this we are transforming IT. Modernizing their datacenters so that they can lower costs, increase agility, get more value from their data and integrate cloud resources with on premises environments. As customers modernize their infrastructures they are replacing standalone silos of storage and monolithic frame arrays which scale out software defined shared storage platforms. Clustered ONTAP enables seamless enterprise data management across flash, disk and public and private cloud environments. With Clustered ONTAP, IT organizations can consolidate multiple workloads into a single repository dramatically improving the efficiency of their enterprise storage infrastructure. We continue to see strong customer demand and are gaining new customers and migrating existing customers to Clustered ONTAP. Clustered ONTAP was deployed on 86% of FAS system shipped in Q2, up from roughly 70% a year ago. Unit shipments of Clustered ONTAP systems grew 14% year-over-year. The installed base of FAS systems continues to grow and Clustered ONTAP is now running on approximately 36% of systems in that large and growing installed base. At the beginning of the fiscal year, we introduced ONTAP 9 which unifies data management across flash, disk and cloud bridging current enterprise workloads and new emerging applications. The initial customer feedback has been tremendously positive. In the first four months since its release, ONTAP 9 has had the highest adoption rate of any of our major ONTAP introductions. In Q2, we expanded the innovation of ONTAP 9 with built-in multichannel capable inscription for improve data security, support for massively scalable high performance NAS containers and greatly simplified provision in operations for enterprise applications. To gain advantage through greater speed and responsiveness from key business applications while substantially lowering total cost of ownership, customers are leveraging flash technology as part of their IT transformations. Flash is being used for a wide range of workloads and becoming the main stream choice for on premises deployments, requiring that all flash arrays deliver enterprise grade data management capabilities. NetApp is leading the industry in the transition to flash with our highly differentiated portfolio of all flash arrays which provide customers with unrivaled scales, speed and data services. Gartner recognized NetApp as a leader in its Magic Quadrant for Solid-State arrays. IDC ranks NetApp number two in the all flash array market with our growth outpacing depth of the market and our peers. We expect to gain share again this quarter. In the second quarter, our all flash array business tripled year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run rate of over $1 billion inclusive of all flash FAS, EF and SolidFire product and services. With flash moving from a point solution to a per basis technology, we refreshed our portfolio of ONTAP powered hybrid in all flash arrays in Q2. We also enhanced ONTAP Select to support flash in commodity servers. Our new hybrid array systems expand the requirements of large enterprise data centers to small enterprises and mid-size businesses offer dramatically increased speed and responsiveness compare to our previous hybrid arrays and scale up to 14 petabytes in a single system and out to a 172 petabytes in a Cluster. Our new all flash systems offer the industries best data management features with up to twice the performance of prior system at half the latency and are designed for easy setup in less than 10 minutes. Our new all flash FAS systems are included in our flash promotion which offers 3X guaranteed performance and a 4 :1 guaranteed increase in storage efficiency over competitive disk arrays as well as a risk free upfront trial, free storage controller upgrade and support extension to simplify ongoing operations. The majority of our growth in the All-Flash-Array market is driven by the All-Flash FAS customers are deploying the All-Flash FAS to improve existing infrastructure and processes, lower cost and enhanced flexibility.  A North American Financial Services Company choose the All-Flash FAS to create a modern alternative to their expensive legacy monolithic private channel SAN array from a competitor. Another North American Financial Services Company replaced the competitor's NAS footprint with an All-Flash FAS cluster connected to a disk-based cluster with SnapVault backup services to create a tiered cloud service model for its next generation file services platform. We\u2019re gaining new customers and new footprint at existing customers with our All-Flash-Array's. For the first half of calendar 2016 NetApp is the fastest growing SAN vendor as measured by IDC. A clear indicator that we are moving outside of our traditional installed base and expanding our market opportunity.  For enterprises and service providers who want to build a multichannel public and private clouds SolidFire delivers a web scale style architecture for next generation datacenters. Through the expanded reach of NetApp we are acquiring new customers introducing SolidFire into existing NetApp accounts and bringing NetApp solutions to SolidFire customers. A global financial services company is moving to NetApp after years of preference for a competitor. They are building a next generation datacenter environment to power their digitization of their services by deploying ONTAP as the storage infrastructure for their open-stack environment, SolidFire for their IT web dev environment and storage grid web scale for their third platform solutions and archiving. Each of these products address unique requirements in the customers environment while delivering the performance and reliability needed for a global digital enterprise. SolidFire is a key area of focused in investments for the long-term growth of NetApp and is performing to plan. Customers are also leveraging the hybrid cloud in their IT transformations to capitalize on the value of their data. Our data fabrics strategy enables data management that seamlessly connects disparate systems, software stacks, clouds and datacenters allowing customers to architect the IT environment that best meets their needs utilizing a mix of flash, disk and public and private cloud resources. All at the scale needed to accommodate the exponential data growth of the digital world. Customers can innovate faster by leveraging the scale of on demand cloud capabilities, while maintaining data visibility with the single consistent view of data and infrastructure of chorus clouds and on premises resources. Earlier this month, we announce new data fabric solutions and services that maximize control and improve the secure movement of data across the hybrid cloud, along with updated versions of AltaVault, storage grid web scale and SnapCenter technologies to help customers extract the value of their data from anywhere in the hybrid cloud. We expanded the used case for ONTAP cloud to include Microsoft Azure and announce cloud control for Microsoft Office 365, a simple way to control and protect critical data stored in Office 365 which support for data retention in cloud services such as Amazon, S3 and Azure as well as on premises storage. Additionally, we introduced NetApp private storage as a service, an OpEx based consumption model available to a growing partner delivery ecosystem. We are engaging with the broadest set of partners to help customers plan and evolve their hybrid cloud deployments to fit their changing business needs, and more and more customers and cloud service providers are choosing NetApp because we enabled their hybrid cloud strategies. While Ron will go into depth about cost savings and capital allocations, I want to reemphasis our commitment to both priorities. At the start of the third quarter we announced a reduction in force as part of our planned transformation and cost reduction efforts. This action was taken in alignment with real structural changes to make our business more streamlined and agile. We are making substantial progress against $130 million cost reduction goal net of reinvestment that the outlined on our Q3 fiscal year 2016 earnings call. We are on target and expect to achieve the remainder of savings through the normal course of business. I want to thank the NetApp team for remaining focused on execution while making difficult restructuring decisions. We are pleased with our progress but still have more work ahead of us. We are advancing our product and solutions portfolio, evolving our ecosystem of partners, streamlining our business processes and enhancing our go-to-market model. We sharpened our focus, accelerated our innovation and are funding the investments against the fastest growing parts of the market like all flash arrays, next generation data centers and hybrid clouds solutions, while accelerating our ability to deliver shareholder value in the form of improved profitability and cash flow. We are on track to return the company to long term growth and to our target operating margin range, but we must remain focused and continue our disciplined execution. Our second quarter results and third quarter guidance are evidence that our strategy is working and I am more confident than ever in the NetApp team's ability to successfully evolve the company for leadership in the data power digital era. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ron to walk through our Q2 financial performance and expectations for Q3. Ron? Ron Pasek : Thanks George and good afternoon everyone. As a remainder, we will be referring to non-GAAP numbers today. As you heard from George, we continue to make significant progress toward growth areas of the market while at the same time transforming the company. Q2 marks another quarter of solid execution albeit against a difficult year-over-year compare. Net revenues were at the midpoint of our guidance at $1.34 billion, this was an increase of approximately 3.5% sequentially and a decline of about 7% on a year-over-year basis. Product revenue of $710 million increased 7.5% sequentially and decline 13% year-over-year. As we have discussed, we expect the growth of strategic solutions to improve our product revenue growth trajectory over the course of fiscal 2017. The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenue of $630 million, was relatively flat sequentially and year-over-year. Gross margin was 62.7% and within our guidance range. Product gross margin of 48.2% decreased about 3.5 points year-over-year and increase 1.5 points sequentially. Software maintenance gross margin was relatively flat sequentially and year-over-year while hardware maintenance and other services gross margin increased just over 3 points year-over-year.  Operating expenses of $636 million decreased 7% year-over-year and 2% sequentially, reflecting the benefit of our ongoing transformation efforts. Operating margin of 15.2% was above our guidance range evidenced of the progress we\u2019re making towards the operating margin range that we guided for the year. Aligning our cost structure with the opportunities ahead remains my top priority. As I said on our last earnings call part of the plan transformation efforts would include additional steps to permanently lower our cost structure including headcount reductions.  As such on November 3rd we initiated a reduction of approximately 6% of our worldwide headcount which will results in a onetime charge of $50 million to $60 million, primarily in Q3 fiscal 2017. This action will yield an annual run rate savings of approximately $130 million. As a reminder we are driving to permanently reduce our cost structure across both cost of sales and OpEx. In Q3 \u201916, we announced our plans to reduce our cost structure by $400 million annualized by the end of fiscal 2017. We said some of those savings will be reinvested into strategic opportunities such as SolidFire and will yield a net run rate savings annually of roughly $130 million by the end of fiscal 2017. We have made meaningful progress against this plan by implementing tighter cost controls over indirect spending, improving supply chain efficiency, streamlining our product portfolio, evolving business processes and reducing headcount. Given the progress we\u2019ve made today, we remain confident in our ability to achieve our goal on schedule. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.3%. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 284 million. EPS of $0.60 was $0.04 over the high-end of our guidance range, reflecting improved gross margin, lower operating expense, and the benefit of our share repurchases. Our cash and balance sheet metrics remain healthy. We closed Q2 with $4.4 billion in cash in short-term investments with approximately 10% held by our domestic entities. We remain committed to completing by the end of May 2018, the remaining balance of our share repurchase program announced in February 2015. In Q2, we repurchased $117 million of our stock, and paid approximately $52 million in cash dividends. Today we also announced our next cash dividend of $0.19 per share, which will be paid on January 25, 2017 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on January 6, 2017. Deferred and finance unearned services revenue was up 5% year-over-year and down 3% sequentially. Q2 cash flow from operations was $158 million up 9% year-over-year. We generated free cash flow of $102 million, an increase of about 3% year-over-year. We are aggressively managing our working capital metrics DSO, DPO and days of the inventory outstanding. DSO were flat year-over-year while DPO increased by eight days and days of inventory outstanding improved by three days. As a result our cash conversion cycle was nine days which was an improvement of 12 days year-over-year, but three days longer sequentially due to the seasonal increase in DSO. Now, onto guidance, as outlined today, our transformation efforts are resulting in stronger more focused and agile company. We were committed to driving productivity, while at the same time continuing to shift our investment and focus towards the growth areas of the market. We're increasingly encouraged by the early signs of progress that we're seeing. While we still have work to do we remain confident in our ability to continue to execute against the plans we outlined for fiscal 2017 on our Q1 earnings call. For Q3 we expect net revenues to range between $1.325 billion to $1.475 billion which at the midpoint implies a sequential increase of approximately 4% and a 1% increase year-over-year. We expect Q3 gross margin in the range of 61.5% to 62.5% and operating margin between 18% and 18.5%. And finally we expect earnings per share for the third quarter to range from approximately $0.72 to $0.77 per share. With that I'll hand it back to Kris to open to open the call for Q&A. Kris? Kris Newton : We'll now open the call for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citi. Your line is now open. Jim Suva : George you mentioned the workforce realignment or change, I believe, like in early November of this year. Can you just clarify -- earlier this month, can you just clarify was that incremental to prior rounds of restructuring and if so, are we at the point where you have now made all your announcements and done all your realignments or is this kind of like phase two or three and still more to come because your OpEx as really been quite impressive, you\u2019re just this kind of measure where you\u2019re at along that phase of thought there? George Kurian : We announced a program to reduce the cost structure of the company permanently as part of our Q3 fiscal year '16 earnings call; and we're making substantial progress against that. We took an action as you can recall in Q4 of fiscal '16 to accelerate the pace of transformation and we've taken a second action in November in alignment with the prior transformation efforts. We took these actions in two steps, to allow the business to make the structural changes necessary so that we can sustain the cost savings going forward. At this point we have accomplished a substantial portion of the cost savings activity and we think we can accomplish the remainder of the savings through the ongoing course of our business operations. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian White with Drexel. Your line is now open. Brian White : I'm wondering if you can talk about a little bit about how the Del EMC combination has offered opportunities thus far kind of what are you seeing out in the field right now. Thank you. George Kurian : Del and EMC continue to be a formidable competitor and we compete with them in the broadest range as both customer and the reseller opportunities as I communicated on the call we are taking core customers from EMC, but because of the strength of our technology both in solid-state as well as next generation datacenters and increasingly because of the relationships that we have with the hyper scale cloud providers. We continue to compete, they continue to compete aggressively, there are a formidable competitors and we need stay focus but we do feel that in this transaction of this combination we do see opportunities both in terms of the recruiting new channel partners as well as willing customer footprints that are net new to NetApp. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold from Raymond James. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : This is Victor in for Simon. I wanted to drill in on your All-Flash products just a little bit. Some of the discussions that we've had with our checking distributors suggested that the success of some of your competitors early on with All-Flash was more attributed to timing and the positive reception that you\u2019re seeing to NetApp solutions more recently implies that those customers may have preferred NetApp's offering all along if it have been available at that time. So can you just comment to the degree that it\u2019s consistent with? What you are seeing and kind of what that means the headroom in terms of improvements in the share gains? George Kurian : First of all the market as we've said before has transitioned from an early adopter market to a mainstream replacement of performance drives with solid state arrays. In that transition customers are looking for consistency in their business processes, risk management, as well as the maturity of the technology solutions and our solid-state portfolio we feel is the best positioned in the market without question. Because we combine state of art technology efficiency and scale out architectures with the world's best data management features for enterprise datacenters with all flash FAS and for web scale datacenters with SolidFire. We have gained share in solid-state and we continue to feel confident about our prospects going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Nolan with Robert. W Baird. Your line is now open. Jason Nolan : I wanted to ask George on MD&A and cross point and how important are these new technologies what's the timing look like and how are you positioned data phase so strong reasonably I'm wondering what this holds for us in \u201917 and in \u201918? George Kurian : I think there are lots of elevations to come in the solid-state storage market the two that you referenced are certainly things that we have in our technology portfolio and we will as I said make those offerings available with when they are mature and ready for mainstream customers just like we have done with All-Flash storage solutions. There is a long roadmap of success ahead on 3D NAND technology, then there is evolutions to that. And what I\u2019ll tell you is that even with with 3D XPoint and NDME, the same values that we have brought to some enterprise all flash array market will continue to have value for customers. Proven software, mature enterprise systems technology and the track record and experience of large successful storage and data Management Company. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steve Milunovich from USB. Your line is now open. John Long : It's John Long in for Steve. Wanted to get the question, are you kind of saying that the competitive environment has allowed product gross margins to essentially reach a bottom here at around 48%, is that we kind of think going forward? George Kurian : It's difficult to tell, the environment changes constantly. I would like to think it's bottom, that would be good. We are doing some work to improve product gross margin, it will take some time for that to pay off. But at this point I think, I would like to think it is the bottom. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani from RBC Capital. Your line is now open. Irvin Liu : Thanks guys, this is Irvin Liu calling in for Amit, first of all congrats on a great quarter. And I just want to ask you about your mature product revenues, they declined by about 29% year-over-year, and I was wondering if there is a sort of maintain level run rate for the mature business going forward and if so how close are we to reaching those levels? George Kurian : So just to set context, the mature bucket includes the OEM business both E and N-series, the ONTAP 7 mode business and the add-on storage components of the mature buckets, we see that the predominant declines are behind us and we\u2019re reaching a point where the forward looking declines should be less material than they have been in the past. As you can see even this past quarter, the rate of decline sequentially continues to moderate relative to what we saw in '16. Add-on storage which is a large percentage of the mature bucket is not going to decline at anything like the rates of 7 mode or OEM and so we feel that going forward we should see some degree of stability in the mature business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz from Barclays. Your line is now open. Mark Moskowitz : I wanted to see if we could better understand the trend line through the underlying business. Strategic revenue growth fell to 1% versus 24% in July and 16%, and then storage system revenue declined nearly 13% after almost flat in last quarter. I guess I'm concerned we're seeing some major decelerations by developing good strides you made in both revenue and also OpEx by containment. George Kurian : Yes, so Mark, I think part of the challenger last year was Q2 was our single highest quarter. So it's really difficult compare. So you saw -- last quarter we actually had product revenue roughly flat and we guided for Q2, we knew that it would be a difficult compare, we knew it was going to be down double digits. If you include the guidance we gave going forward that starts to get better as we move forward to Q3 and Q4. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Rod Hall : Just came off the Cisco call and commentary there has written -- relates to a little bit of underlying weakness in enterprise, obviously the forward looking, more service provider. But a lot of the numbers suggest weak enterprise spending particularly in the midsize business environment, so I wonder if you guys could comment on what you're seeing from that point of view? And then I guess I also would ask you to comment a little bit on the cash return policy. Obviously we're looking at potentially lower tax rates now and some changes with the administration coming up with Trump presidency, so could you just talk a little bit about how that might affect your thinking with regards to cash return? George Kurian : Okay, let me take the economic environment, as we've said on the call, it remains uncertain macroeconomic environment, I think spending decisions are not materially different than they were in the prior quarter, but you have to compete every opportunity and we've done that through the course of this quarter and we intend to do that successfully through the course of next quarter. I would say that the geographic mix of our business reflects the economic environment across the globe. It's a diverse landscape and we have strengthened some parts of the work where the economic environment is stronger and our executions has been better and it's been mixed in other parts of the world. I'll let Ron talk a little bit about our cash return policy. Ron Pasek : There's couple of things being discussed. We would prefer fundamental corporate tax reform as opposed to one-time holiday. We'll wait and see what that looks like and decide what the best return policy is based on that. And I think doing a holiday is beneficial and it might be advantage to take -- for us to take advantage of that, but to fix the permanent disadvantages U.S. companies have in the world will require a fundamental corporate tax reform. George Kurian : [Multiple Speakers] It's a little early for us to comment. We're going to wait to see what the new administration defines to be its policies both on trade and tax and then we'll communicate our plans soon thereafter. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers of Stifel. Your line is now open. Aaron Rakers : I wanted to talk a little bit differently about the competitive landscape. I know Cisco was mentioned in a prior question. Cisco's obviously got a strategy of trying to push their HyperFlex product. We now see Nutanix out in the market as a public entity. I'm curious to how you guys are currently seeing the hyperconverged market, where you see that competitively showing up and, if not, why that wouldn't be. George Kurian : First of all, our relationship with Cisco has been strong, the All-Flash FAS has driven a really strong business together with FlexPod and is allowing us to compete in parts of the data center with FlexPod that we couldn't before. The second is as we said hyper conversions has a value to customers who require rapid time to provisioning or a very simplified configuration for departmental and small office workloads. We have two approaches to compete with hyper converged solutions, one is a set of innovations that we brought to the FlexPod family called FlexPod Automation and the second is with SolidFire which provides a zero touch storage provisioning solutions. The release of SolidFire that we introduced in the summer of this year called Fluorine allows us to compete very well with Hyper converge solutions and VMware environments and we have been seeing wins. So we realize there is value to customers from Hyper converged offerings and we have solutions to respond to those customer needs. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Louis Miscioscia with CLSA. Your line is now open. Louis Miscioscia : Can you maybe help us out with the guidance both on the high-end and the low-end? In essence the high-end if we were actually able to do it, if I\u2019m doing my math right would suggest a quarter-to-quarter product revenue number given that software entitlement services have pretty steady numbers of a 127 million quarter-to-quarter and absence dollars and going back over the six or seven years now really got about close to anything like that, usually going into the quarter usually doing about somewhere between let\u2019s say 50 million or 55 million. So how did you ever get through high-end number and then alternatively maybe if you could comment on why there would be a possibility of product revenue down 22 million quarter-to-quarter from an absolute numbers standpoint? George Kurian : We were taking a broader range. We look back and there are quarters where we were up sequentially, probably not as high as what you are quoting on product revenue, but we wanted to give a wide berth both ways and it's just really being conservative. You saw in Q2, we gave that same for rest of the 150 million we hit it spot on so. I think there -- it is a difficult environment its unpredictable and we\u2019ll try to make sure we\u2019re in the range somewhere close to that point. Louis Miscioscia : Maybe just following on the past question, do you -- some are not predicting your budget plus as they finish the year are you getting any visibility to that one way or another realized your quarter into January? George Kurian : Difficult to tell as different customers in different markets, in different geographies. Certainly sometime certain customers have December as their yearend not all customers obviously and then as we said our quarter ends in January. Louis Miscioscia : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Simona Jankowski : I just had a follow-up first or a clarification on the improvement in product gross margin. Can you just unpack for us what drove that, to the extent some of that was from the perhaps slightly more benign pricing environment versus the cost reductions you've been implementing versus mix because I'm just trying to get to the go forward and how many of those drivers might be permanent. And then I just wanted to follow up on the comment you made about better exposure or greater exposure to hyper scale customers. Could you quantify for us roughly what percent of your revenue now goes into those kinds of customers? Thank you. Ron Pasek : Look, Simona. I think if you look, we do have -- tender to have a seasonal bump up in product gross margin from Q1 to Q2. You can call it customer mix if you\u2019d like, so that's what, what you saw to a largest that, but part of that will continue in Q3, but not to the same extent also in Q3 what we have is higher products revenue which puts a little pressure on the overall margin rate. George Kurian : I think in aggregate Simona what we are doing in that to address gross margins is both continued to drive transformation into our services business which has allowed us to improve the gross margins of that business over the last few quarters. And on the product side being delivered about the use of promotions as well as improving the pricing and discounting approaches in our transactions. So we will -- we\u2019re generally focused in gross margin in aggregate and we have enough leverage to keep the gross margin within the ranges that we shared with you. In terms of the hyper scale question, what I was referring to was the fact that we are building hybrid IT solutions that combined on premises data centers with the data enter and IT architectures of the hyper scale providers. This includes solutions like NetApp private storage for secure cloud storage. It includes solutions like the AltaVault solution and it includes the use of our software as part of hyper scale market places. And what they are doing is, while that part of our business is not material, they are allowing us to win on premises transactions because of a compelling forward looking hybrid IT roadmap that customers can buy into. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini of Susquehanna. Your line is open. David Ryzhik : This is David Ryzhik for Mehdi Hosseini, thanks so much for taking the question. What percent of cDOT shipments in the quarter were all flash FAS? And regarding ONTAP 9, how much of a factors is that in your migration from 7 mode to cDOT? And do you think there was some customer cause ahead of ONTAP 9 and should ONTAP 9 catalyze additional migration? Thanks so much. George Kurian : I would say that in terms of the all flash FAS solutions, all of the all flash FAS solutions are based on clustered ONTAP as an operating system. And so they count towards our aggregate clustered ONTAP numbers, they are a growing percentage of the clustered ONTAP business, not yet the majority. So we have room to go. In terms of the installed base, there are a variety of reasons why customers choose to migrate from 7 mode to clustered ONTAP and flash is certainly an important part of that transition. The fact that we have a very compelling all flash FAS solution is encouraging customers to move in some cases their upgrade schedules up. David Ryzhik : Great thanks. And regarding ONTAP 9, have you seen that drive any incremental interest from 7 mode customers? George Kurian : ONTAP 9 continues to provide compelling technology for customer of both traditional NetApp customers as well as net new to NetApp customers. The combination of scalable mass containers, volume granular inscription on parallel storage efficiency and performance together with the new platform that we recently announced, all give customers more reason to upgrade from 7 mode to cDOT or for competitors to come to us. So we feel very good about the progress we have made. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your lien is now open. Steven Fox : Just on the topline outlook for the quarter, you\u2019ve accelerated the return of year-over-year growth by that a quarter versus what you said on the prior call. So I was just curious what was the main two or three drivers in sort of pulling in that return of year-over-year growth into this current quarter? Thanks. George Kurian : We have always said that we -- our plan was to return the company to growth in aggregate in fiscal '18 and that we would -- our plan was to return product revenue to growth in the second half of this year; we're on plans for that and we feel even more confident than we were a few quarters ago both because the mature products are stabilizing in terms of their go forward as well as the strength of our strategic solutions. Steven Fox : So, there's not one or two things you would say, probably bigger drivers, as obviously I think most people are thinking that was going to happen in the fourth quarter so. I'm just curious if there's something that you would say has increase our confidence more than other things. George Kurian : I would just say our aggregate execution against the plan and the fact that we've been consistently meeting expectations. So I think that's the real basis for where we are and as I said the mature products are less material a part of our business and the majority of the declines are behind us and the strategic solutions continue to perform well. So, we got to keep our head down and execute the plan. And I would just tell you that's my focus right now. Operator : Our next comes from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Sherri Scribner : I was hoping you could provide us with some additional detail on the SolidFire business, how much did that grow in the quarter and do you expect that to continue to be significant growth driver? George Kurian : SolidFire is as we've outlined an important part of the focus and investment for us because it allows our customers to build architectures for their next generation data centers with us that they can't with anyone else. As we laid out at the time of the acquisition of SolidFire, SolidFire would contribute about 2% to our revenue for this year and would offset the OpEx operating margin by roughly 2% and I would tell you that we're on track to those plans. We've been gaining new customers to NetApp using SolidFire, we've been introducing NetApp customers to SolidFire and we're executing according to plan that we laid out. So, this is all about where we are with SolidFire. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andy Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Andy Nowinski : It looks like the only region or vertically you had year-over-year growth in this quarter was the U.S. public sector; just wondering if you could give us any more color on that growth whether the budget for us was larger this year than last year or whether you gained share in the space? George Kurian : Public sectors procurement cycle was according to what we had thought and according to -- was in alignment with plan, we didn't see any unusual activity upward or downward in the public sector market, we have continued to execute well to capture the share of opportunities that are out there and so I would just say it is the budget flush that we saw in public sector was normal. Operator : Our next question comes from line of Maynard Um with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Maynard Um : Can you clarify whether there was any product gross margin benefit from the shift in marketing that you talked about last year and it seems like you see scope for more improvement in product cost going forward partially from marketing shift, also from restructuring, can you just talk about how you prioritize gross margin improvement versus market share gain, I heard you mention that you're hopeful this is the bottom in product gross margin. I guess I'm asking the opposite question as we look forward in our modeling, should we be looking at product gross margins going up, going forward mix aside or will you sort of trade that for revenue market share gain? Thanks. George Kurian : We would just in aggregate we operate to the gross margin guidance that we have laid out and it's a combination of improvements in service and product gross margins I would say right now what we\u2019re focused on is capturing footprint with our All-Flash-Array's as well as converting customers and facilitating the conversion of customers from 7-Mode to Clustered ONTAP. We\u2019ve said that we have put in place promotions that facilitate both of those objectives that are strategic to the company in the market and we constantly monitor the value of those promotions and their impact in terms of achieving our strategic objectives.  The product innovations that we have made over the last year and a half continue to provide us with a really solid platform for differentiations and so any point in time we reserve the right to continue those promotions or to remove them from the marketplace and we constantly trade off the benefits of those with the benefits to improvements in gross margin. Ron Pasek : Just to be little clear, on the services side is where are you seen most of the improvements we've made that will be a transformation. So that to some extent helps with the gross margin overall in the last couple of quarters. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tim Long with BMO Capital. Your line is now open. Tim Long : George, you mentioned the geographic performance tracking with what we're seeing from a macro standpoint. Could you talk a little bit about EMEA and APAC? It looks like the last few quarters they probably lagged the performance in North America, the Americas, at least on a year-over-year basis. Anything to that from your product standpoint or execution standpoint? And how should we think about those starting to catch up? Thank you. George Kurian : I would say that in EMEA and APAC they are vastly different geographies with different macroeconomic situations. I think that we have seen strength in certain parts of EMEA and APAC where the economic landscape has stayed relatively benign and we have gained share in those environments. In others where there is more uncertainty, you see that impacting transactions and so we've had to compete to maintain share and we have done a good job doing that. I would say that we're going to wait to see what the economic outlook looks for those companies and we have built a fairly conservative outlook into our guidance. And so we continue to focus on gaining share wherever we can gain share, but do so with an outlook that builds into the forecast that the macroeconomic situation in those countries. Emerging markets is the same which falls into our Americas geography. The preponderant part of the Latin American geographies are in our Americas business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Eric Martinuzzi with Lake Street Capital. Your line is now open. Eric Martinuzzi : Yes, just curious in working with your channel partners, there was -- some of your channel partners have been representing maybe competitive All-Flash-Arrays out in the markets. What incentives or what steps are you taking so -- maybe for an account that isn\u2019t kind of a NetApp installed base where an [technical difficulty] from NetApp would be a layup, kind of a Greenfield opportunity. What are you doing to get it -- make that a NetApp install as oppose to a competitive product install with your channel partners? George Kurian : I think its starts with the customer, it starts with making sure customers understand the value of NetApp technology and I think we\u2019ve made substantial progress there. Analyst commentary customer references the portfolio of products from NetApp and our intense focus on raising our profile in the All-Flash-Array markets, as well as candidly the success and momentum that we\u2019ve demonstrated substantially outpacing the market as well as our peers gives us access to more customer conversations than we\u2019ve ever had before. Some of that also is reaching those customers through new low cost innovative digital marketing channels which our Chief Marketing Officer is an expert that doing. And then the third is enabling the channel so that they focus their attention on NetApp portfolio. I think we\u2019re using all of those levers, and we feel good about the progress, this is an unending -- I would just tell you this is an ongoing game, right. So as I\u2019ve said on my call, we are very pleased with the momentum, but we\u2019re going to keep our heads down and we\u2019ve got more work to do and we\u2019re doing that every single day, staying focus on execution. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Katy Huberty : Question about support attached to the strategic business versus mature. Curious whether there is a different dynamic or attach rate, because hardware maintenance is down year-on-year and differed revenue declined more than seasonal this quarter despite the fact that install base is growing. So just trying to understand that implications for the maintenance business? Thanks. George Kurian : There is no difference in the attach rate between a strategic and mature. We are still, as you said, seeing a growth in installed base, although it is a little bit slow. What we have is very, very good growth in obviously the new cDOT products. But as you recognized product revenues for the last couple of quarters have declined, that puts a little pressure on that install base, but it is growing. Deferred is growing significantly year-over-year, there were some seasonal things that happened quarter-to-quarter, remember renewals -- it's must be renewals, and those happened to a large extend in the second half of the year. So that leaves a little bit of a trough in the first half. Operator : And our last question comes from the line of James Kisner of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is [indiscernible] on for James Kisner. George, you mentioned 3D NAND roadmap and your flash business is doing really well, but are you seeing any negative impact from NAND shortage this year, and I don\u2019t know what's your visibility into NAND pricing, are you signing a long term contracts? Ron Pasek : We are able to secure what we need for NAND, it is a tight supply. No one is signing long term contracts right now. So I think we\u2019re able to get what we need and prices are tight. George Kurian : I think and just to add to Ron's comments, I think ensuring supply is the combination of both technological as well as commercial relationships with the NAND suppliers and we have excellent relationships with multiple of them. So we feel good about where we're at but it is constrained market. Operator : I would now like to turn the call back over to Kris Newton for any closing remarks. Kris Newton : And I'll hand it over to George. George Kurian : I wanted to just summarize the comments that I made at the start. I'm pleased with the progress that we've made both in the top line and the strategic portfolio of products that align with our customers priorities as well as with the productivity and efficiency of our business. We are increasingly confident to bring additional innovation to customers, add new customers, working with the hyperscale ecosystem that drives the next generation of IT as well as transforming to be a more agile, focused and faster moving company. We have achieved an enormous amount of progress and I want to thank the NetApp team and are closer to returning the company to growth than we have been in a longtime. We have more work to do to bring excellence to all facets of our business and we're going to stay focused and deliver yet another quarter of meeting our commitments to our shareholders. Thank you and we'll see you on the next call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude your program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

LLC Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the NetApp Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this call may be recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Kris Newton, Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. You may begin. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Hello. Thank you for joining us on our Q3 fiscal year 2017 earnings call. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and our CFO, Ron Pasek. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com, along with the earnings release, our financial tables and guidance, a historical supplemental data table and the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation. As a reminder, during today's call we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the fourth quarter, and our expectations regarding future revenue growth, improved profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons, including macroeconomic and IT spending environments, and our ability to successfully innovate in the growth areas of the market, gain market share, expand our operating margin, reduce our cost structure and continue our capital allocation strategy. Please also refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, specifically our most recent Forms 10-Q, our Form 10-K for fiscal year 2016, and our current reports on Form 8-K, all of which can be found on our website. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP, unless otherwise indicated. I'll now turn the call over to George. George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.: Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. We executed well in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, again delivering solid results with revenue at the midpoint of our guidance range and both operating margin and earnings per share above our guidance. Our innovation in emerging areas of the market is expanding and creating new growth opportunities for us. In the quarter, we strengthened our industry-leading portfolio with the introduction of new all-flash arrays and hybrid cloud solutions, positioning us to address a growing set of customer use cases. With focus and disciplined execution, we are successfully innovating to meet the evolving needs of our growing customer base while at the same time streamlining our business. As we deliver on our commitment to return the company to revenue growth with improved profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns, we remain focused on three priorities. First, our Data Fabric platform and the strategic solutions that are built for the opportunities of a data-centric world. Second, lowering our cost structure and streamlining operations while maintaining our ability to innovate. And third, a robust capital allocation program, which includes the mix of share buybacks, dividends and investment for the long-term growth of the business. I'll begin with an update on our first priority. Ron will update you on the other two. Our strategic solutions position us to lead in the new era of IT. These flash-enabled, cloud-integrated offerings provide customers with the future proof solutions required for success in a data-centric world. In Q3, strategic solutions constituted 65% of net product revenue, up 22% year-over-year. Net product revenue from our mature solutions declined 18% year-over-year. As we've said in the past, the headwinds from mature solutions will lessen, allowing the growth of the strategic solutions to return the company to moderated revenue growth in fiscal year 2018. Consistent with the plan we've laid out and as you saw in our Q3 results and Q4 guidance included in our press release, the momentum of our strategic solutions is already delivering top line growth. Customers are maximizing the value of their data by prioritizing investments to modernize the data centers, increase agility, and integrate cloud resources with on-premises environments. Clustered ONTAP allows customers to modernize their infrastructure by replacing stand-alone silos of storage and monolithic frame arrays with a scale-out, software-defined shared storage platform. Uniquely in the storage industry, Clustered ONTAP enables seamless enterprise data management across flash, disk and public and private cloud footprints for enterprise applications with the ability to consolidate multiple workloads into a single repository for improved efficiency. Clustered ONTAP continues to perform very well. We are gaining new customers, expanding our footprint with existing customers and successfully migrating our install base. In Q3, Clustered ONTAP was deployed on over 90% of FAS systems shipped. Unit shipments of Clustered ONTAP systems grew 24% year-over-year, and the install base of FAS systems continues to grow. And Clustered ONTAP is now running on approximately 40% of systems in that large and growing install base. Additionally, we reached an exciting milestone this quarter which underscores the momentum we've had with Clustered ONTAP. Clustered ONTAP now manages over 50% of the FAS system capacity in our install base. Flash is the mainstream choice for new on-premises deployments as customers seek to lower total cost of ownership while gaining greater speed and responsiveness from key business applications. NetApp leads the industry in the transition to flash with cloud-integrated solutions that provide unrivaled efficiency, speed, scale and data management. Per IDC's calendar Q4, all-flash array market data, we strengthened our number two position. And our growth in flash continues to outpace both the market and our competition, large and small. Although NAND supply is tight, we are confident in our ability to meet demand and we expect our share gains to continue. In our third quarter, our all-flash array business grew 160% year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run rate of almost $1.4 billion, inclusive of all-flash FAS, EF, and SolidFire product and services. The majority of our all-flash array business is driven by Clustered ONTAP, deployed at both FAS engineered systems and FlexPod converged infrastructure solutions. This year, we have refreshed our entire all-flash FAS portfolio with the A-Series designed specifically for flash and are experiencing strong adoption of these new products. The A-Series all-flash systems deliver industry-leading performance, capacity, scalability, security and network connectivity in dense form factors. In Q3, we introduced a new entry-level system which extends enterprise-grade flash to midsize businesses. At the start of Q4, we announced a new high-end system which continues NetApp's track record for innovation with an NVMe fabric-ready clustered architecture. We also enhanced our storage efficiency capabilities and introduced an industry-leading workload-specific guarantee that scales to a 5-to-1 data reduction ratio. The beginning of February marked the one-year anniversary of our acquisition of SolidFire. SolidFire creates an avenue of growth for us to address customers' data requirements as they build out next-generation data centers. We are growing the SolidFire business through the expanded reach of NetApp, acquiring new customers, introducing SolidFire into existing NetApp accounts and bringing NetApp solutions to SolidFire customers. We are further leveraging our SolidFire investment and expanding our growth potential by developing the next generation of hyper-converged infrastructure built on SolidFire innovation. We will do what has not yet been done by the immature first generation of hyper-converged solutions, bringing hyper-converged infrastructure to the enterprise by allowing customers the flexibility to run multiple workloads without compromising performance, scale or efficiency. As part of the data fabric platform, it will also be the first fully cloud-integrated ACI solution, giving customers the ability to leverage their data across on-premises, public cloud and hybrid cloud environments. With this innovation, we further broaden our industry-leading portfolio with cloud-integrated solutions available in stand-alone, converged, hyper-converged and software-defined offerings. We will have more information on the development of this exciting new solution for you in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. The NetApp data fabric enables data management that seamlessly connects disparate systems, software stacks, clouds and data centers. This allows customers to architect the IT environment that best meets their needs, utilizing a mix of flash, disk and public and private cloud resources. IT organizations can be more responsive to the needs of the business by leveraging the scale of on-demand cloud capabilities while maintaining data visibility with a single consistent view of data and infrastructure across clouds and on-premises resources. We continue innovating in this space, and at the start of the third quarter announced new data fabric services. These as-a-service and consumption-based offerings allow customers to control, manage, secure and move data across on-premises and public cloud resources. By providing data portability and cloud integration, we are increasing our strategic relevance and expanding our opportunity. Customers and cloud service providers are choosing NetApp because we enable their hybrid cloud strategies. A large U.S.-based insurance company chose NetApp Private Storage for cloud to leverage the elasticity of the cloud to spin up or down computer network as needed for quantitative research and analysis while keeping full control of their data. A large North American-based retailer selected NetApp all-flash FAS to replace its legacy EMC SAN infrastructure because we solved their current application integration, replication and management challenges with a compelling path to hybrid cloud. At a cloud-based talent management solution provider, we displaced over 1 petabyte of legacy EMC and HP storage for the company's production and disaster recovery environments. Our cloud integration and the ability to scale with their business were key factors in the customer's decision for NetApp. Ron will go into depth about cost savings and capital allocation, and I want to re-emphasize our commitment to both priorities. We're helping customers transform their businesses for success in the data-powered digital era by enabling their efforts to modernize their infrastructure, build next-generation data centers and harness the power of the hybrid cloud. With our powerful portfolio of innovative solutions and data fabric strategy, we have enormous opportunity to lead in this next year of IT. I remain extremely confident in our ability to successfully execute against this opportunity. The transformation of NetApp is yielding results and has changed the trajectory of our business. We have a sharp focus on delivering innovation to address an expanding range of customer requirements in the fastest-growing parts of the market, while lowering our cost structure and streamlining the business. We've improved our agility and are delivering innovation at an accelerated pace. With continued execution, we're on track to increase shareholder value and return the company to long-term growth and to our target operating margin range. We will hold an Investor Day in New York on April 5, where we will share more detail on the evolution of NetApp to lead in the data-powered digital era, as well as our multi-year business outlook. We hope that you'll be able to join us. I'll now turn the call over to Ron to walk through our Q3 financial performance and expectations for Q4. Ron? Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.: Thanks, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers today, unless otherwise noted. Q3 marked another strong quarter with net revenues hitting the midpoint of guidance. Net revenues were $1.4 billion, an increase of 5% sequentially and 1% year-over-year. Product revenue of $784 million increased over 10% sequentially and 5% year-over-year. As George highlighted, the strength of our strategic solutions drove overall product revenue growth. The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenue was $620 million, relatively flat sequentially and down slightly on a year-over-year basis. Gross margin was at the low end of our guidance range at 61.5%, reflecting higher excess and obsolete reserves due to faster than anticipated adoption of our latest platforms and, to a lesser extent, foreign exchange headwind. Product gross margin of 45.7% decreased about 2.5 points sequentially and 5.5 points year-over-year. Software maintenance gross margin was roughly flat on a sequential and year-over-year basis. Hardware maintenance and other services gross margin increased about 4 points sequentially and 5.5 points year-over-year, directly attributable to our ongoing transformation efforts. Operating expenses of $579 million decreased 9% sequentially and 8% year-over-year, and were below our Q3 guidance due in part to variable compensation and, to a lesser extent, foreign exchange benefit. As a result, operating margin of 20.2% was above our guidance range. Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 18.6%, an increase of over 1 point sequentially, reflecting a higher mix of U.S. profits as transformation benefits were slightly disproportionate to the U.S. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 281 million. Earnings per share of $0.82 was $0.05 over the high-end of our guidance range, a result of higher operating profit and lower diluted share count. Our cash and balance sheet metrics remain healthy. We closed Q3 with $4.6 billion in cash and short-term investments, with 11% held by our domestic entities. In Q3, we repurchased $284 million of our stock and paid $52 million in cash dividends. We remain committed to completing the share repurchase program that we outlined in February, 2015. Today, we also announced our next cash dividend of $0.19 per share, which will be paid on April 26, 2017, to shareholders of record as of the close of business on April 7, 2017. Deferred and financed unearned services revenue was up 1% sequentially and 3% year-over-year. Q3 cash flow from operations was $235 million, an increase of 49% sequentially. However, on a year-over-year basis, cash flow from operations was down $120 million. Although GAAP net income was comparable in Q3 FY 2016 and Q3 FY 2017, we had higher levels of inventory and accounts receivable this quarter. Accounts receivable grew in the quarter due to higher revenue and linearity in the quarter. Inventory grew due to timing associated with specific deals, as well as an increase in evaluation units for all-flash FAS and SolidFire. We generated free cash flow of $190 million, a decrease of 39% year-over-year. Our cash conversion cycle is 17 days, which was an improvement of nine days on a year-over-year basis, but eight days longer sequentially. Again, these metrics reflect higher accounts receivable and inventory, partially offset by higher accounts payable. As George said, we're confident in our ability to meet demand in flash. So we have cured enough NAND to meet the anticipated demand for the remainder of the fiscal year. Now, to guidance. Our transformation efforts are yielding results. NetApp is stronger, more focused and more agile. We remain committed to executing against the plans we've outlined for you. For Q4, we expect a revenue range of $1.365 billion to $1.515 billion. We expect consolidated gross margins of approximately 60% to 62%. The gross margin range incorporates some conservatism due to NAND cost increases. We expect operating margins of approximately 18.5% to 19.5%. As we announced in Q3 a year ago, we're reducing our cost structure across both cost of sales and OpEx by $400 million gross, annualized by the end of fiscal 2017. We are reinvesting some of the savings into strategic opportunities. And based on our Q4 guidance, we are overachieving our committed net run rate savings of $130 million exiting this year. Finally, we expect earnings per share for the fourth quarter to range from approximately $0.79 to $0.84 per share. With that, I'll hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris? Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: We'll now open the call for Q&A. Please be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to one question, so we can get to as many people as possible. Thank you for your cooperation. Operator : And our first question comes from Andrew Nowinski of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Great. Thanks for taking the question. So your all-flash revenue growth accelerated this quarter. One of the reasons we're hearing that you're getting wins within your install base is because customers prefer not to retrain their staff on a new operating system when they moved to all-flash. So I guess have you seen any changes in your win rates within your install base? And then, can you provide any color around the percentage of existing customers that are still not yet running in all-flash array? George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.: Our success in all-flash arrays is broad and wide. We have net new customers, we have new workloads within our existing customers, and upgrades within our install base. I would tell you that the net new customers and new workloads are materially bigger as a percentage of our all-flash business, reflected, for example, in the market share gains we're seeing in the SAN business, rather than our traditional install base. As percentage of our install base, all-flash FAS is a very small percentage. It's less than 10% of the deployed install base. So we've got lots of headroom to go. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Thanks, Andy. Next question? Operator : And our next question comes from Mark Moskowitz of Barclays. Your line is now open. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. Just want to get a little sense here in terms of how much of some of the momentum in your revenue base is being driven by some of the disruption at some of your other competitors versus just you guys having a much better product set than a year ago? And then, Ron, I know you did talk about the gross margin profile, but just wanted to get a sense here if there's any more details you can share with us in terms of why the product revenue margin is a little lighter relative to our expectations, but the services margin much better? Thank you. George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.: Let me take the first question. We are seeing momentum both because we have a compellingly differentiated product set. As we have noted, the all-flash market is now going from early adopter to the mainstream market where customers are moving entire disk-based estates over to solid-state and therefore require the full range of features in their all-flash arrays from a business process, from a data management protection and availability perspective. Both all-flash FAS, as well as SolidFire give customers a compellingly differentiated platform; and the EF-Series is the fastest performing box in the industry. I think, in addition, we are clearly seeing disarray at our competitors. Our leading competitors, neither have the flagship flash product, as well as going through substantial challenges from an integration perspective. And customers are looking to NetApp to give them a path forward for their all-flash estates, as well as to the hybrid cloud. Ron? Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.: So, Mark, I think what we've tried to intimate is on the services side there is \u2013 that's what represents quite a bit of our transformation efforts. It's not just OpEx. So we've done a lot of work to increase the margins on the services business. On the product side what I mentioned, quarter to quarter the only unexpected variance was E&O [excess and obsolete] due to a faster than anticipated product transition. As we move to Q4, in the guide, there's a little bit of headwind for a flash COGS increase. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: All right. Thanks, Mark. And just a reminder to everyone, please limit yourself to one question. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your line is now open. Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC : Thanks for the question. Just following up on that, could you just expand a little bit more on your product gross margin outlook maybe beyond this quarter? You mentioned some NAND costs and like you addressed the reserves. So as those reserves sort of grandfather along and your mix sort of continues to improve towards flash, how do we think about longer term product gross margin potential? Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.: I'm going to save that answer for our April 5 investor meeting. I'll give you quite a better view of next year and probably a little longer term. It's not something I feel comfortable guiding with right now. Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC : Okay. Since we're passing on that, could I just ask a quick one then, in terms of \u2013 you mentioned on the competitive environment. Can you give us a little more color then on the competitive environment within all-flash arrays? How rational do you think it is versus your expectations, or any other color would be helpful? Thanks. George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.: I think, first of all, in the competitive landscape, things have not changed substantially. As we said, the major competitor that we go up for the majority of the deals are the large system manufacturers, most notably EMC and the other high-end SAN arrays that we are displacing with all-flash FAS. HP has always been the low-price leader, and they lack the feature set in terms of data management services. So they compete aggressively on price. And the startups are increasingly challenged to differentiate themselves, and so you see evidence of desperation from various different smaller startup players. I'll just leave it there. Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC : Great. Thank you very much. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Okay. Thank you, Steve. Next question? Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Tim Long of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you. If we could just dig into some of the other strategic areas, obviously, the all-flash piece grew pretty aggressively in the quarter. It looks like some of the other pieces of that which you break out in the strategic line are down fairly meaningfully year-over-year. Could you just talk a little bit about what's going on there? Is it cannibalization? What's driving the downside to the other part of strategic? Thanks. George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.: Overall, strategic products were up 22% year-on-year, so we saw really strong growth. In terms of the strategic numbers, it's only product revenue that comprises the strategic number. Our all-flash array number includes products and services, right? I think when you think about all-flash versus hybrid flash arrays, I mean, they're essentially solutions we offer customers. Some customers, for their workloads, choose all-flash solutions and some customers choose hybrid solutions. We have a unique advantage in the market that we are able to offer customers choice with the same set of data management capabilities. So if the price of NAND rises unexpectedly, we can always offer them a hybrid solution which no one else in the market can offer. Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Thank you. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Thanks, Tim. Next question? Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jayson Noland of Robert Baird. Your line is now open. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. Great. I wanted to ask on NVMe, George. It sounds like a big deal, but I'd love to get your perspective from a timing and NetApp positioning perspective? George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.: We have NVMe support in the flash arrays that we introduced to market, so the flat FAS9000, the 8200, 2600 series all have NVMe integrated onboard for a low latency cash. We also have in the A700s a NVMe over fabric ready architecture. NVMe will become just like fiber channel. It'll take time to get adopted and become deployable widely at customers as a true storage solution. We're working with the industry to make that available, and it will become part of every platform. I don't think there is meaningful differentiation from NVMe. I think, as I've said continuously, proven data management capabilities, integration in the application domain, and delivering business value will be the composition with customers. NVMe will become a check box that all of us will have, us included. Jayson A. Noland - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Thanks, Jayson. Next question? Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you. George, I want to ask you just a high-level action around the cost savings, because the OpEx level that you're running at now you haven't been there since 2011 when the revenue run rate was about 7% lower. So can you talk about some of the areas where the company is able to be more efficient than it was at different revenue levels, especially given that the product portfolio has expanded and the competitive landscape is arguably more intense than five years or so. And then, just as you look going forward, how do you think about balancing opportunities for additional cost savings versus starting to reinvest more of that to ensure that you can maintain the growth that you put up this quarter? Thank you. George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.: First of all, in terms of the cost savings that we have taken on, it's a transformation across all aspects of the business. I would say in the product portfolio, it is to leverage the capabilities that the supply chain has to not only meaningfully reduce the cost of introducing new hardware platforms, but actually accelerate the pace at which we are introducing new hardware platforms. The recent lineup of FAS hardware platforms were introduced at 3 times lower cost of introduction and three 3 faster. So we're substantially better in terms of the way we build systems and hardware. The second is in terms of our shared services environments, we've consolidated the operations of many of our back end functions into a shared services platform. There's continuing work to be done to complete that transition, but that offers promise of not only savings for this year, but in years to come by being much more efficient. Things like reporting, payroll administration, various elements of human resources and so on will be delivered from a centralized shared services facility rather than close to the employees, giving us both consistency and operating leverage. And in the go-to-market area, as you can see, the work that we have done, particularly in the services business, have materially improved the profitability of that line. We've integrated, for example, self-service support, online chat as opposed to human support. And you'll see us integrating advances in machine learning so that customers can both get better satisfaction, but at a lower cost. So we remain committed to doing that. As we think about the savings that we generate, we'll continue to look at all of the options that are in front of us, right? Returning some of that through improved profitability to shareholders, as well as investing in the long-term growth of the business. One of the meaningful areas that we've invested in is SolidFire. And you can see, we're not only leveraging that investment in the all-flash array segment, but to deliver a compellingly differentiated hyper-converged offering to the market. Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.: Katy, you should think of transformation as not an event; it's something we're going to do ongoing. And we'll talk about that more on the April 5 meeting. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Thanks, Katy. Next question? Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Simona Jankowski of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi. Thank you. First, just a quick clarification. I wasn't clear if OpEx is now at a bottom and will build up from here, or at least stabilize, or do you still expect it to go down? And then, the question I had was on hardware maintenance which came in a bit short of our and consensus expectations. If you can just give us some insight into what drove that and how you see it going forward? Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.: Yeah. Let me take the second question first. So, first of all, our install base and our FAS install base continues to grow. We need to exclude PS and training. Maintenance is only down 1% year-over-year and 1% quarter-over-quarter. We are starting to see some ASP declines that we're passing on, basically better pricing, as a result of our transformation savings. Coupled with that, we are seeing asset lives extend to five years and beyond which explains the growth in deferred revenue and more specifically long-term deferred revenue. And as product revenue continues to grow, this will lead to service revenues growing again. With respect to OpEx, if you impute the guide I gave for Q4, there is some seasonality upward. And, again, I'm not going to guide next year, but we still have work to do on our cost structure. So I'll just leave it at that. Simona K. Jankowski - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Joe Wittine of Longbow Research. Your line is now open. Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC : Thanks. Just a question on your OpEx outperformance. Throughout the first three quarters of the fiscal year, you've developed a pretty consistent pattern where gross profit dollars are very close to the midpoint of the ranges, which is great. But then your OpEx is substantially lower, roughly $20 million a quarter below the implied guide. So what is that dynamic driving that consistent beat? I know you quickly referenced lower variable comp this quarter. Is there anything kind of... Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.: There were a lot of different pieces. The combination of variable comp and FX is only half of the variance. There's a ton of other little things that added up. I would just say that, you're right, year-to-date, we're consistently under spending. I think that points to the culture we're changing around OpEx management and transformation. Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC : Thanks. And the rest my question was that, does your same methodology kind of apply to the April quarter guide? Thank you. Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.: I did the best job I can of the guide, so there's no games being played here. Joe H. Wittine - Longbow Research LLC : Thanks. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Thanks, Joe. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Milunovich of UBS. Your line is now open. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. I was just curious, when you talk about install base numbers, are you talking about number of systems, number of customers? And how does the rate of change today compare to, say, two years ago? Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.: It's the number of systems under contract. Two years ago \u2013 I still think we have more systems under contract than even two years. It's probably at an all-time high right now. In fact, it is. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : Was the install base growing at a similar rate or faster two years ago? George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.: I think the install base of units is growing at a faster rate now. I think in terms of the systems, life cycle continues to expand, right? So I think the continued extension of life cycle is what causes the install base to have legs and growth, right, in addition to the product revenue growth that we're seeing now, so. Steven M. Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Next question? Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes Maynard Um of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Maynard J. Um - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Thanks. In the past, you've typically passed along the cost of media price increases or price declines to customers. But based on your product gross margin conservatism commentary, has something changed in your ability to pass along those costs? And any color on when NAND pricing should start to decline and be a tailwind for you? Thanks. George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.: Okay. Let me take the first one, and Ron will take the second. I think in terms of our approach to media prices, we've generally taken the position that we will pass on whatever cost structure being offered to us, benefit or disadvantage, from the media manufacturers to our customers. I think the caution is really reflecting the dynamic nature of SSD availability and pricing. As we noted, we've put in place the capability to meet a short supply. We're wanting to guarantee a short supply to our end customers, and that has been a priority ahead of specific pricing agreements. Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.: And from what we can tell, obviously, this is somewhat an estimate, supply will be tight for the rest of the summer, probably should ease later in the calendar year is what we're thinking. And prices should come back a little bit better later in the calendar year as well. Maynard J. Um - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Great. Thank you. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: All right. Thanks, Maynard. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Simon Leopold of Raymond James. Your line is now open. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much. I was hoping you'd be able to help us quantify the headwind from the NAND in terms of how much pressure it's putting on the gross margins. And then, help me understand why your product gross margins traditionally have been lower versus some of your peers. I imagine it's a little bit of apples-to-apples, but help me set the baseline with that? Thank you. Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.: Yeah. So in the guide for Q4, I'd say, there's probably a headwind of about a half a point in total gross margin erosion. About seven ticks is SSD COGS increase to some extent. I think if you look at our history of gross margin, it has vacillated over the years. I think it's something we do need to focus on. And the good news is we've offset that with a lot of the increase in the service margins. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: All right. Thanks, Simon. Next question? Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Rod Hall of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I just had two. Well, I wanted to clarify one thing and then I have a question, I guess. The clarification is, can you guys just say \u2013 you're saying that you've got NAND supply into, I guess, the April quarter. Do you have it on through July or have you only guaranteed it for one quarter forward? Because it sounds like October and January quarters, probably the supply, you think, is going to be back to decent again. And then, my question is, the Dell EMC channel deal that was announced a couple of weeks ago, I guess it started at the beginning of February, can you just comment on whether you're seeing impact from that in the channel? Do you have to make any changes in your own channel program? And how lucrative is this relative to your existing channel program? Thanks. Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.: So with respect to NAND, we've secured supply for the remainder of this calendar year, at which point I don't think this is going to be an issue anymore from a supply standpoint. George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.: From a channel program perspective, we've started to see the beginnings of an integrated channel program from EMC. I'll just tell you that incentives are just a small part of the total value proposition that a channel partner looks for from their supplier. I think the competitiveness of the product portfolio, the fact that we enable our channel partners to have a rich base of margin-rich services associated with the business that they're doing with NetApp continues to make us a compelling value proposition to our partners. So we're going to continue to attack with the full breadth of our channel, and we are making progress as our results note. Rod B. Hall - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Thanks, Rod. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi. Thank you. I just had two accounting clarifications. It seems like the strategic solutions revenue changed slightly, historically, and versus last quarter. So can you just explain what moved into the different buckets? And then, it looks like amortization ticked up. Can you explain why amortization went up? Thanks. Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.: So we did make one adjustment to historical strategic for one product that we had accounted for incorrectly. We're experimenting with what's called Express Packs, and that didn't get counted in strategic in the past three (41:08) quarters. So we made one adjustment. George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.: They are solutions that are fixed configurations of our Clustered ONTAP and all-flash FAS products that make it easy for the channel to procure, and we did include that in a couple of the past quarters. So there's a slight adjustment for that. The second question was on amortization. Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.: There's a slight increase in SolidFire amortization for new developed technologies. It's pretty small. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thanks. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Thanks, Sherri. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi of Lake Street Capital. Your line is now open. Eric Martinuzzi - Lake Street Capital Markets LLC : Yeah. I was just comparing the international, the mix versus a year ago. It looks pretty consistent there. Do you see that sustaining? And could you comment, specifically, on EMEA and APAC? George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.: We have a broad book of business around the world. I would just tell you our book of business is affected by GDP outlook, as well as the competitiveness of our portfolio and execution against those opportunities. We didn't notice any specific change in pattern through the course of the quarter across the broad base of geographies that we serve. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Thanks, Eric. Eric Martinuzzi - Lake Street Capital Markets LLC : Do you expect that \u2013 okay. George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.: Yeah. We expect the trend to continue the same. Eric Martinuzzi - Lake Street Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Irvin Liu - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Hi, guys. This is Irvin Liu calling in for Amit. So on your flash business, given that flash is currently running at a $1.4 billion annual run rate, are you guys seeing the margin profile for flash improve versus your mature business? And if so, how should we think about flash array margins, versus disk, or versus hybrid? Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.: You shouldn't think of a different margin profile between strategic and mature. They're relatively the same. And I think that's also true with flash, hybrid and traditional spinning disk. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Thanks. Next question? Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from John Lucia of JMP Securities. Your line is now open. John A. Lucia - JMP Securities LLC : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to see if you guys could give us an update on the spending environment in storage, in general? It seems like things have improved over the last couple quarters in terms of the way you're discussing the market. Have you seen sales cycles shorten or are customers more decisive in their spending? Any kind of color would be great. George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.: I think through the course of the quarter, we saw a strong year-end budget flush. We saw January return to fairly normal patterns of uncertainty across the geographies that we serve and saw linearity similar to normal sort of back end loaded quarters, right? I think in terms of the segments of the market that we serve, I think our pivot is targeting the faster growing parts of the market. So there's a lot more interest as a share of wallet for the technologies that we're offering today, like solid-state, next-generation data centers, object storage, as well as what we're thinking about delivering to market in the hyper-converged space. I think in terms of traditional environments, you continue to see people sweat assets trying to get longer lifecycles out of that. We're benefiting from the fact that we've got a differentiated portfolio. We're benefiting from the fact that the portfolio is targeting the places where customers are spending. And, frankly, we're benefiting from the fact that Clustered ONTAP significantly and substantially transforms the cost structure for legacy frame array. We can go in there at an order of magnitude greater efficiency and enable lots more software features than they've historically had. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Thanks, John. John A. Lucia - JMP Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Lou Miscioscia of CLSA. Your line is now open. Louis Miscioscia - CLSA Americas LLC : Hey, George. Sort of on that same line, but looking at a little bit more into the future. Some very big companies like Verizon, GE, Cap One, all look to close their data centers. Maybe could you give us some thoughts on the trajectory for the next two, or three, or four years of storage, in general? Because obviously you've got a very nice quarter here, so congratulations on that. But just worried if you're running off of a weak compare; in that, when you sort of get to the actual year-over-year compare, it either flattens or goes down. George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.: We'll give you more details of the long-term outlook at our Analyst Conference. I can just tell you that we are increasingly seeing wins where people are using NetApp Private Storage solutions connected to public cloud providers. And what we've always said is we anticipate returning the company to moderated revenue growth. Our focus on transformation allows that moderated revenue growth to generate substantial returns to shareholders, and we're delivering on that commitment right now. Louis Miscioscia - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. Thank you. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Thanks, Lou. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian White of Drexel. Your line is now open. Brian J. White - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Yeah. George, I know you came in here at NetApp as CEO in mid-2015. The company was going through a lot of issues at that time. You've really righted the ship and done a phenomenal job here. What's the next big thing that we should think about that will move the needle for NetApp? And do you think NetApp will gain share over the next few years? Thank you. George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.: I think if you look at our results today, we are gaining share in the markets that we serve. In the all-flash array market, there's no question we're growing faster than competitors, big and small. I think if you look at the storage and device management market, we took over the number one position from EMC in that market. We've made solid progress in Clustered ONTAP in terms of transitioning our install base, and are doing so with greater operating margin leverage. As we indicated on the call, we are working on a next-generation hyper-converged solution which we think will allow us to do to the hyper-converged market what we did to the all-flash array market : serve the needs of mainstream customers with a platform that's differentiated with performance, enterprise data management capabilities, and hybrid cloud integration. We think that's what the market wants. And we're focused and going to be delivering that, and you'll see us make some exciting announcements early next fiscal year. Brian J. White - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Great. Thank you. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Thanks, Brian. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is now open. Aaron Rakers - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.: Yeah. Thank you for taking the question. George, building on that last comment, I'm just curious of how you currently see the hyper-converged market. Have you seen it compete at all relative to your traditional FAS systems? Or as you push into this market, how do we think about it from being an adjacent or incremental opportunity for NetApp to go after? George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.: It isn't a net new market that we serve. It will allow us to serve the system or virtualization administrator at customers rather than the storage administrators. The hyper-converged market today is sort of a first-generation solution. The solutions don't have enterprise data management features. They have challenges with performance consistency, which requires them to become a single workload configuration and are, therefore, addressing the low-end market, the departmental market. There are few solutions that can really serve anything broader than that market. What we're trying to bring to customers, just like we did in the all-flash array market, is a solution that allows customers the benefits of ease of administration, but with the unique benefits of performance and scalability, enterprise data management and hybrid cloud integration, which really gives us a net new market to address. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Thanks, Aaron. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of Susquehanna. Your line is now open. David Ryzhik - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Hi. This is David Ryzhik for Mehdi Hosseini. Thanks so much for taking my question. Some of your smaller emerging competitors use a third-party for system hardware procurement, which appears to be an enabler for higher product gross margin. Is this a potential avenue for you to explore? And it seems like SolidFire does this. Any comment around the potential for this to expand across your core product portfolio? Thanks so much. George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.: As I've said, as part of our transformation efforts we have continued to leverage the supply chain, the industry supply chain, to build technology for us. If you look at the recent A700s flash-optimized, NVMe fabric ready architecture, it was sourced by \u2013 off the \u2013 an ODM model, right? So we are expanding the range of usage of off the line platforms across the range of our business, both in SolidFire as well as in our traditional FAS business. David Ryzhik - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Great. Thanks so much. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Thanks, David. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. Just another question, I'm afraid, on gross margins. Did you say, Ron, that the gross margins between the strategic and the mature segments are pretty similar? Can you just clarify... George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.: Hey. Could you speak up a little bit, please? Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: I'm sorry. Hi. A question on gross margins, again. Did you say that the gross margins between the mature and the strategic segment are pretty similar? Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.: Yes, they are. Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Between the two? Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.: Yes, they are. Yes, they are. Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Okay. And then, so when you look at just the direction of your product gross margin over the last couple of years, apart from the memory cost maybe rises, has it just been the lack of scale that's been driving that down and pricing pressure into the wrong portfolio, and that corrects itself? Is that how we should think about it? Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.: Yeah, mostly. I mean, I've talked about this before. It's mostly discounting. That's what most of the margin erosion is from. George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.: We've had also been running promotions to get our customer base transitioned from 7-Mode to Clustered ONTAP. As we announced this quarter, those promotions \u2013 we've transitioned 50% of the capacity in our install base to Clustered ONTAP, and so we're seriously evaluating whether we need to continue those promotions. Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: And so, would you say we're near the trough on gross margins, then? Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.: I'd like to think so. Again, what I've said before is, we still want to be competitive. So we're trying to do that in a balanced way, and it's hard to know. I wouldn't want them to go any lower. But, again, we've got to be competitive. Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Thank you, Kulbinder. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from George Iwanyc of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. George Iwanyc - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thank you for taking my question. Following up on the promotion and discounting comments that you just made, are those being competitively driven, are there secular pressures that have forced those for the most part? Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.: They're in response to competitive, especially the promotions. And one of them was unique to us, which George mentioned; and some of the other ones are in response to competitive. George Iwanyc - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Could you see the market normalizing on that front? Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.: Yeah. And, again, we'll talk more about this when I give the outlook for next year in April, but that would be the thinking. George Iwanyc - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.: Thank you. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Thanks, George. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jim Suva of Citi. Your line is now open. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks very much. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned operating expenses that you appear to be ahead of goal, progressing much faster. Can you help us, as we look ahead, does the goal move higher, is it you're getting the expenses benefit sooner and we shouldn't project even more savings because now products are doing well? How should we think about the goals and where you're at, because you are ahead of that goal? Thank you very much. Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.: Yeah. The goal we established was last year, and we said from Q3 2016 to this going out rate of Q4 2017 we'd save a gross $400 million. And then, after some strategic investments, which includes SolidFire, it'd be a net of $130 million. If you impute my guide for OpEx, you can almost get there on an annualized rate between Q3 OpEx of 2016 annualized and the guide I gave for Q4. You can almost get to the whole $130 million. And when you add the savings associated with the services work we've done, you can more than get there. We haven't guided anything beyond that at this point. But, as I said, transformation will still exist as we go forward. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you very much. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Thanks, Jim. Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from the line of Rich Kugele of Needham and Company. Your line is now open. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Thank you. Good evening. George, if we're going to look at the case study of the all-flash FAS progression, clearly innovating from the ground up with all your feature set, as well as supplemented by acquisitions was the right approach, ultimately. Now, with hyper-converged, you really seem to be trying to go and leverage what you had acquired with SolidFire. And what can we tell investors to give them comfort that this would be the right approach as opposed to what happened with the all-flash? George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.: I think in both of those cases, our perspective is the long-term winner, as we have demonstrated in the all-flash array market, is the one that can take an architecture and serve the mainstream customer segment. There have been lots of companies that have gone after the early-adopter segment with a subset of the features that enterprise customers really want and have failed in the long run. And so, first to market doesn't necessarily mean the big winner, right? I think what we are trying to do with the hyper-converged segment is the same track record that we've demonstrated with the all-flash array segment, which is customers want mature enterprise data management features. They want performance consistency and scalability, so that they don't have to have operationally a siloed environment. And hybrid cloud is really the architecture of the data center going forward, and they want true hybrid cloud integration. And so, we think that by offering those capabilities to customers, we will redefine the hyper-converged market just like we did to the all-flash array market. Rich J. Kugele - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.: Stay tuned. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Thanks, Rich. George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.: The transformation of NetApp is yielding solid results with the return to top line growth and increasing profitability. We're expanding our opportunity by addressing an increasing range of strategic customer use cases. We've completely refreshed our portfolio of hybrid and all-flash arrays, delivered an industry-leading storage efficiency guarantee to the market, expanding our cloud-based services, and soon we will introduce a next-generation Hyper converged solution. All of this underpins our growing confidence in the future. We hope to see you in April at our investor event where we will talk more about the evolution of NetApp to lead in the next era of IT. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Have a great day, everyone.",

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Kris Newton, Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Ma\u2019am, you may begin. Kris Newton : Hello and thank you for joining us on our Q4 fiscal year 2017 earnings call. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Ron Pasek. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com along with the earnings release, our financial tables and guidance, a historical supplemental data table and the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation. As a reminder, during today\u2019s call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2018 and our expectations regarding future revenue growth, improved profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons, including the macroeconomic and IT spending environments and our ability to successfully innovate in the growth areas of the market, gain market share, expand our operating margin and continue our capital allocation strategy. Please also refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC, specifically our most recent Forms 10-Q, our Form 10-K for fiscal year 2016 and our current reports on Form 8-K, all of which can be found on our website. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP, unless otherwise indicated. I will now turn the call over to George. George Kurian : Thanks, Kris and good afternoon everyone. The fourth quarter marked a strong finish to fiscal 2017 for NetApp. Our continued focus and disciplined execution yielded yet another quarter of solid results on the top and bottom lines. Revenue for the fourth quarter was at the high end of our guidance range with both operating margin and earnings per share above our guidance. We have returned the company to revenue growth with improved profitability and earnings. By innovating to redefine traditional markets, bring enterprise-grade technology to emerging areas of the market and meet the evolving needs of our growing customer base, we are creating new opportunities for NetApp, gaining market share and expanding our addressable market. When I became CEO, I set 3 priorities for the business : pivot to the growth areas of the market; reduce the cost structure of the company; maintain a robust capital allocation program. This intense focus has helped us systematically improve our execution and drive efficiency through the business and ultimately meet or beat our goals. We have successfully delivered against each priority and have effectively completed the first phase of our transformation. I\u2019ll provide more detail on this first phase and then share some perspective on the focus areas for the next. Consistent with the plan we\u2019ve laid out, the headwinds from mature solutions, add-on hardware, OEM and ONTAP 7-Mode are lessening. In Q4, product revenue from mature solutions declined 7% year-over-year. Going into FY \u201818, the transition from 7-Mode to clustered ONTAP is largely behind us, and we have a renewed focus on hardware and software OEM opportunities. These both will further moderate the decline in mature solutions. Strategic solutions, which position us to lead in the new era of IT, was 70% of net product revenue, up 24% year-over-year. By emphasizing our Data Fabric strategy and our flash-enabled cloud integrated strategic solution, we\u2019ve driven a re-acceleration of the business. Our success in pivoting to the growth areas of the market is evident not only in the shift of our product revenue to strategic solutions, but also in the mix of our systems business, the majority of which now comes from products in the high-growth all-flash array market. We are in the early innings of the movement to flash and have a significant growth opportunity ahead as we penetrate our installed base and displace competitors\u2019 installations with our all-flash solutions. Clustered ONTAP allows customers to modernize their infrastructure by replacing stand-alone silos of storage and monolithic frame arrays with a scale-out, software-defined, shared storage platform, delivering seamless enterprise data management across flash, disk, public and private clouds. We have successfully migrated over 50% of the capacity and almost 50% of the FAS systems in our large installed base to clustered ONTAP. In Q4, clustered ONTAP was deployed on 95% of FAS systems shipped. And as I noted earlier, the transition from 7-Mode to clustered ONTAP is now behind us. NetApp leads the industry in the transition to flash with cloud-integrated solutions that provide unrivaled efficiency, speed, scale and data management. We strengthened our number two position in calendar year 2016 and our growth continues to outpace the market and competitors, both large and small. We have entered into an agreement to acquire Plexistor, a company with technology and expertise in ultra-low latency persistent memory. This differentiated intellectual property will help us further accelerate our leadership position and capture new application types and emerging workloads. For customers looking to modernize existing data centers, All Flash FAS deployed as both FAS engineered systems and FlexPod converged infrastructure solutions is the clear choice. We have been very successful replacing legacy frame array solutions from our competitors in Tier 1 SAN deployments, accessing a new market for us by disrupting it with flash. In 2016, NetApp was the fastest-growing of the leading SAN suppliers, a clear indicator that we are moving outside of our traditional installed base and expanding our opportunity. In Q4, our all-flash array business grew almost 140% year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run rate of $1.7 billion, inclusive of All Flash FAS, EF and SolidFire products and services. We are winning with flash and expanding our intellectual property in this market, positioning us for success in the multiyear transition from disk to flash. The all-flash FlexPod and our momentum in the channel helped to strengthen our #2 position in the converged infrastructure market and contributed to the 44% year-over-year growth of FlexPod revenue reported in IDC\u2019s quarterly converged systems tracker for calendar Q4 2016. We also recently acquired Immersive Partner Solutions, a cloud-based converged infrastructure monitoring and compliance company. We will integrate this intellectual property into our FlexPod solutions to help customers further simplify and automate life cycle management and enhance our leadership in the converged infrastructure market. We are growing the SolidFire business at an accelerating pace through continued innovation and expanded reach. The FY \u201817 revenue performance with SolidFire was in line with the expectations we laid out at the time of acquisition, and SolidFire was significantly less dilutive to our overall operating results than we expected. On our last earnings call, we announced that we are further leveraging our SolidFire investment and expanding our growth potential by developing the next generation of hyper-converged infrastructure. Development is on track and we look forward to sharing more details later this quarter. Enterprises, cloud service providers and partners choose NetApp, because we enable their hybrid cloud strategies through our Data Fabric architecture. The NetApp Data Fabric delivers consistent and integrated data management services and applications for data insight, access, control, protection and security, enabling customers to unleash the full power of their data. We displaced Dell/EMC as a cloud service provider with our all-flash FlexPod solution for its SAP HANA implementation. The customer chose NetApp because of our value and industry leading functionality. We helped a leading wine producer and distributor, realize their hybrid cloud strategy with the all-flash NetApp private storage for cloud, ONTAP Cloud and OnCommand Insight to manage it all. Key requirements of this transaction were a cloud strategy and the ability to manage complex migrations. OnCommand Insight allows customers to look at disparate storage environments in their data center and increasingly in the hybrid cloud to make decisions about where they want to optimize resources. The strength and focus of OnCommand Insight allows us to displace legacy competitive solutions and it is now the leader in the storage and device management market. Ron will go into the details about our cost reductions, but I am pleased to announce that we overachieved in our goal of delivering a net run rate savings of roughly $130 million in OpEx and cost of sales. More importantly, we have made good progress towards focusing the business, driving disciplined portfolio management and systematically generating more efficiencies while setting a high bar for execution. Our capital allocation program includes the balance of shareholder returns and investment in the business. In FY \u201817, we returned over $900 million to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends. Additionally, we made organic and inorganic investments to support the long-term growth of the business, like the development of our ACI solution and continued innovation in all-flash arrays and hybrid cloud solutions. Having successfully completed the first phase of our transformation, we will now drive the second phase delivering sustained growth in the fast growing parts of the market while maintaining a focus on margins and productivity. Again, we will focus on three priorities; first, we will expand our total addressable market by growing our portfolio and the ways we deliver it, strengthening our leadership position in all-flash arrays and converged infrastructure markets, continuing to push into Tier 1 SAN opportunities, introducing our ACI solution as well as new cloud services and partnerships, reinvigorating our OEM program and addressing new buyers in new ways. Second, we will continue to make fundamental changes to drive productivity, enabling further investment in the business while continuing to expand our operating margins. And third, we will continue our robust capital allocation program, which includes the combination of shareholder returns and investment for the long-term growth of the business. FY \u201817 was a pivotal year for NetApp. We started the year with bold commitments and we delivered against all of them. We did what many said could not be done; return the company to growth while simultaneously expanding operating margins. With each successful step in our transformation, my confidence in our ability to create new opportunities and execute against those opportunities grows. As an independent player of scale, our openness creates a unique opportunity to partner broadly for successful customer outcomes. The mix of our business is weighted more towards the fastest growing parts of the market than our traditional competitors and we have significantly greater technology differentiation, customer relationships and scale in those growth areas than the new players who are trying to address them. As we enter FY \u201818, we are building on a strong foundation and are without question, the best positioned and the best executing in the industry. I will now turn the call over to Ron to walk through our Q4 and fiscal year 2017 financial performance and go-forward expectations. Ron? Ron Pasek : Thanks George and good afternoon everyone. As a reminder, I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers today, unless otherwise noted. NetApp delivered a strong finish to fiscal 2017. Our results clearly demonstrate the substantial progress we are making toward transforming the business, driving sustained growth and addressing the rapidly changing market. Before discussing our full year results and future expectations, I will provide detail on our performance in the fourth quarter. Q4 net revenues were at the high end of our guidance at $1.48 billion. As we anticipated, the growth of our strategic solutions more than offset the declines in our mature solutions and started driving net revenue growth in the second half of 2017. The year-over-year Q4 net revenue growth of more than 7% is clear evidence of this dynamic. Product revenue of $852 million grew over 12% year-over-year, led by flash and the continued strength of our strategic solutions. The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenues increased 1% year-over-year. Gross margin of 62.5% was 1 point better than Q3 and above our guidance range. Product gross margin of 48.9% increased about 3 points sequentially and 2 points year-over-year, reflecting improved sales discipline, fewer promotions and lower reserves [ph]. Software maintenance gross margin was roughly flat sequentially and increased just over 1 point on a year-over-year basis. Hardware maintenance and other services gross margin decreased over 1 point sequentially, but increased over 2 points year-over-year, reflecting the benefits from our transformation initiatives. Operating expenses of $619 million increased 7% sequentially, reflecting higher variable compensation due to the higher than expected revenue growth. Despite slightly higher operating expenses, our operating margin of 20.7% was above our guidance range. Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 22.1%, an increase of 3.5 points sequentially, reflecting a higher mix of U.S. profits. We ended the quarter with 278 million weighted average diluted shares outstanding. EPS of $0.86 exceeded the high end of our guidance range by $0.02 as a result of higher revenue and higher gross margin. Cash and balance sheet metrics remained healthy in the quarter. Our cash conversion cycle improved 13 days year-over-year, reflecting 24 days of combined improvement in DSO and DPO from our transformation initiatives, partially offset by a 10-day increase in DIO. Additionally, cash flow from operations grew 6% year-over-year to $365 million. Deferred and financed unearned services revenue declined 1% year-over-year due to lower ASPs and to a lesser extent, execution issues within renewals. Free cash flow grew 5% year-over-year to $327 million. Inventory turns decreased by 9 turns on a year-over-year basis, reflecting increased flash inventory and timing. To reiterate, we are confident that we have secured adequate NAND supply to meet anticipated demand for the remainder of this calendar year. We have a unique advantage through our deep business and technical partnerships with our NAND and SSD suppliers. We partnered to help them bring their new technologies to market faster and consequently maximize our continuity of supply. We repurchased $129 million of NetApp shares and paid $51 million in cash dividends during the quarter. Finally, we ended the year with approximately $4.9 billion in cash and short-term investments, with roughly 9% held by our domestic entities. Now turning to our full year 2017 results, net revenues of $5.52 billion were relatively flat compared to fiscal 2016. Gross margin of 62.3% was relatively flat compared to the previous year and was within our guidance range. Operating margin of 17.2% improved almost 4 points versus fiscal 2016 and was above our guidance range of 15% to 17%. In fiscal 2017, we took important and in some cases, difficult steps that were necessary to lower our cost structure and improve the alignment of our resources to our strategy. We committed to reducing our cost structure across both cost of sales and OpEx, yielding a net annualized run rate savings of $130 million after investment in SolidFire and other growth areas of the business. I am pleased to report that we exceeded this commitment, achieving annualized net run rate savings of approximately $140 million despite the impact of higher variable compensation in Q4. Our effective tax rate was 19.2% and 1.5 points above expectations, reflecting the higher mix of U.S. profits. EPS of $2.73 for the full year increased 28% from 2016. We continued to deliver on our capital allocation strategy through a combination of dividends and share repurchases in excess of $900 million. We returned over 110% of free cash flow to shareholders this year. Additionally, we have completed over $1.7 billion of a $2.5 billion repurchase program we announced in February of 2015. We remain firmly committed to delivering shareholder value and are on track to complete the remaining $800 million by the end of May 2018. Today, I am pleased to announce a 5% increase in our next cash dividend to $0.20 per share, which will be paid on July 26, 2017. Now to guidance. I am confident that we are making the right investments to compete and win not only in the market segments where we are strong today, but also in the new high-growth areas of the market. We are making tough decisions in key investments to expand our TAM and drive strong financial performance over the long term. Looking ahead to fiscal 2018, we expect moderated revenue growth to ramp throughout the year, consistent with our normal seasonal trends. We are forecasting a gross margin range of 62% to 63% and expect operating margin in the range of 18% to 20%. We are committed to delivering low double-digit EPS growth and expect our effective tax rate for the year to be approximately 19% to 20%. Additionally, we expect to continue generating meaningful free cash flow in the range of 17% to 19% of revenues, enabling us to invest in growth as well as continue to return significant capital to our shareholders in fiscal 2018. With that in mind, I would like to take a moment to remind you of seasonal trends relating to our operating margin. We typically build momentum through the fiscal year. As such, Q1 is generally our softest quarter for operating margin, reflecting seasonally lower Q1 revenue as well as seasonally higher operating expenses mainly from salary adjustments. That said, now on to guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. We are forecasting a revenue range of $1.24 billion to $1.39 billion. At the midpoint, this implies year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 2%. We expect gross margins of approximately 62% to 63%. We are targeting Q1 operating margins of 13.5% to 14.5%, reflecting the seasonality I just discussed. We expect EPS to be between $0.49 and $0.57. This implies a 15% growth year-over-year at the midpoint, which is consistent with our typical Q1 contribution to full year EPS and consistent with the long-term model of low double-digit EPS growth that I shared with you at our recent Analyst Day. In closing, I am very pleased with NetApp\u2019s performance in fiscal 2017. We have sharpened our focus, accelerated our innovation and are shifting the investments toward the fastest-growing parts of the market while accelerating our ability to deliver shareholder value through improved profitability and cash flow. The substantial progress we have made drives my confidence in NetApp\u2019s growth potential and future. With that, I will hand it back to Kris to open the call for question-and-answer session. Kris? Kris Newton : We\u2019ll now open the call for question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Andrew Nowinski : Alright, thanks for taking the question and great quarter again. So your product gross margin improved nicely again this quarter, and I think you mentioned fewer promotions. Can you just give us any color on the promotion that you are no longer using and then maybe even a color on how you are competing against Dell/EMC as it relates to pricing? Thanks. Ron Pasek : Sure. I think we hinted at this at our Analyst Day. There was a cDOT promotion we had run for quite some time, and we were very clear that it pretty much ran its course and it, in fact, did. That definitely helped. As well, I think there were a couple other things that contributed, including better sales execution and discipline, and we didn\u2019t have the charge we had in Q3 of \u201817 as well. George Kurian : We have also introduced a new class of high-value products and ONTAP 9.1 software that continues to differentiate our portfolio. So, overall, strong new products differentiation there, continued sales force discipline and execution as well as removing the clustered ONTAP migration program now that the majority of the migrations are done. With regard to EMC, as we said, we have competitive programs in place and we see continued momentum from those competitive programs. In Q4, we accelerated the rate of EMC take-outs for 2 \u2013 1 a day, and we mentioned that it was once every few days at the Analyst Day. I think in Q4, we have accelerated that to once per day, representing the fact that we have got the best all-flash array portfolio in the market. Andrew Nowinski : Great. Thanks a lot. Kris Newton : Thanks, Andy. Next question? Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian White with Drexel Hamilton. Your line is now open. Brian White : Hi, yes. George, could you talk a little bit about the trends you are seeing in the U.S. public spending vertical for the quarter and maybe for orders moving forward? I know one of the big OEMs highlighted weakness in that vertical over the past week. Thank you. George Kurian : We had a good quarter in public sector, representing both market share gains as well as execution by our field organizations. I would tell you that the outlook for public sector depends on the budget that the new administration passes. I think we have a broad book of business in the public sector market. So my sense is that it\u2019s too early to tell, but defense is probably strengthened and civilian is probably hampered a little bit by the \u2013 if the budget passes the way it\u2019s shaped. We have got a broad book of business, and we continue to demonstrate leadership and execution in that market. Brian White : Great. Thanks. Kris Newton : Thanks, Brian. Next question? Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Sherri Scribner : Hi, thanks. Ron, you mentioned that you expect revenue growth to moderate \u2013 I think you said moderate, moderating revenue growth through the year. Can you talk a little bit about what that means exactly? I think you are \u2013 the midpoint of your guidance is just 1.6% revenue growth. Is revenue going to accelerate as we go through the year? Or is it going to be kind of in the same levels? How are you thinking about that as we progress through the year? Thanks. Ron Pasek : Yes, what I tried to say, Sherri, is coming off of Q4, where we grew 7%, down to Q1, where we are seeing a roughly 2% year-over-year growth. We do expect that to accelerate through the year. Sherri Scribner : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, Sherri. Next question? Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Stifel. Your line is now open. Aaron Rakers : Yes thank you. At the Analyst Day, you talked a little bit about the penetration rate of your customer base that shifted to all-flash. I am curious if you could give us an update with regard to that and how we should think about that looking out over the next 12 months. Where do you think that possibly could go? George Kurian : I think we are in the early innings of the transition to all-flash. I would tell you our total opportunity is not only within our installed base where all-flash systems are less than 10% of our large and growing installed base, but also in displacing competitor frame arrays and legacy storage environments. So we are in the early stages of a multiyear transition from disk to flash, and we feel very well positioned to capitalize on that market transition. We are the fastest-growing vendor in the all-flash array market. It\u2019s outpacing our competitors, large and small. I think if you look at our numbers, we are up 140% year-over-year as compared to others who are in the 30% range. And if you look quarter-on-quarter, we are up 24% as opposed to them down sequentially in the same range. So we feel very, very good about our portfolio. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jayson Noland with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open. Jayson Noland : Okay great. I wanted to ask on the revenue guidance. You mentioned accelerate through the year. Can you grow product revenue for FY \u201818? Ron Pasek : Well, yes, coming off the quarter in Q4 where we did, yes, absolutely. That is the plan. Jayson Noland : For the full year F \u201818 over F \u201817, no? George Kurian : Absolutely. Jayson Noland : Okay, thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, Jayson. Next question? Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Kulbinder Garcha : Thank you for the questions. I guess given where you are guiding, it looks like operating margin for the first quarter you have to exit the year probably at peak levels in the low-20s, I think is the other trajectory we should think about or is there more of a step-up sooner in the year? Thanks. Ron Pasek : Well, Kulbinder, as you saw this year, we started out quite low as well and accelerated from 12% in Q1 of \u201817 to over 20% in Q4 of \u201817. So yes, that is the seasonality I was addressing in my prepared remarks, so absolutely. Kris Newton : Next question? Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Simona Jankowski with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Simona Jankowski : Hi. Thank you. Just a couple of follow-ups from that also, in terms of the out-performance in product gross margins in the quarter, is an element of that driven by increasing prices to pass-through some of the NAND cost increases. And then Ron, for the first quarter, you talked about the OpEx seasonality, is there a seasonality relative to gross margin you would point us to or a mix impact. And then finally, from a long-term perspective, what is the natural product gross margin that you think is realistic for you guys, can you get back to the low-50s range? Thank you. Ron Pasek : Yes. So the first part of your question Simona, so yes, I think what we had indicated is that we did raise prices in many of our flash products as a result of NAND prices increasing to us. And so in many cases, we did pass that along. The only seasonality you will see in gross margin relates sometimes to Q2 on a product basis. We see year end public sector revenue and margin go up. Otherwise, it\u2019s not that cyclical. I would hesitate to give a long-term guide on product margin. It is certainly our intent and I mentioned this at the Analyst Day that we should be doing better than we are and that is part of our AOP, or annual operating plan, for FY \u201818. Simona Jankowski : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks Simona. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Maynard Um with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Maynard Um : Hi. Thanks. Can you just talk about the change in your go-to-market that you talked about at your Analyst Day, how much have you done and any qualitative or quantitative thoughts you can share on what you are seeing. And then similarly, with the compensation structure changes, have you seen any disruptions or any kind of turnover in sales that have been outside the norm? Thanks. George Kurian : I think first of all, the confidence in our employees, customers and reseller partners is exceptionally good. I think the turnaround has been seen positively by everybody and we are attracting the world\u2019s best talent to NetApp. I think in terms of the compensation plan, the coverage model and some of the things that we talked about at the Financial Analyst Day, we recently implemented that at the start of May, which is the plan for the new fiscal year, fiscal \u201818. And so we are going to play that out through the course of this year. I think we entered the year with a really strong capacity number in terms of quota bearing heads, which is what we had said that as part of transformation, we are going to redeploy investments from non-quota bearing roles to quota bearing roles and we feel really good. The momentum in the product portfolio demonstrated market share gains and the right amount of capacity to execute our game plan for this year. And as I mentioned, we intend to grow product revenue year-on-year this year, accelerating through the course of the year. Maynard Um : Great. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Maynard. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kurtz with Pacific Crest Securities. Your line is now open. Alex Kurtz : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I apologize if you have already touched on this, but when you look at your all-flash growth, can you help us quantify how much of that\u2019s coming from the installed base refresh over maybe the last nine months or so and how much of that is net new customer growth? George Kurian : We are gaining new customers, new workloads and existing customers. And the two of them are represented by the fact that we are based on public market data from IDC, for example, the fastest growing major SAN vendor, fiber channel storage vendor, which is a net new market for NetApp. We have converted a small percentage, as I mentioned less than 10% of our install base to all-flash arrays. So the majority of our growth is coming from outside our installed base. Alex Kurtz : Okay, alright. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Alex. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Your line is now open. Steven Fox : Thanks. Good afternoon. I am just a little confused on the gross margin guidance, so you are talking about doing 62% to 63% in the first quarter and then also for the full year even though you are talking about accelerating sales growth, can you just walk us through some of the puts and takes between Q1 and say the full year guidance? Thanks. Ron Pasek : I mean so we generally see Q1 as fairly flat to Q4. We have a little higher mix of services revenues, which usually helps gross margin. However, we do have NAND costs still increasing, so that\u2019s a little bit of a headwind. As I mentioned at Analyst Day, I think that will start to dissipate later in the year and certainly into next year. We are maintaining a fairly conservative range for the year, where we are trying some new things with compensation in the sales force. And we want to see them take hold. We will see how that goes. I think it can only be upside. Steven Fox : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Kelleher with D.A. Davidson. Your line is now open. Mark Kelleher : Great. Thanks for taking the question. You talked about reinvigorating your OEM program, can you maybe talk a little bit about what your plans are there? George Kurian : I think it\u2019s too early to comment. I think we do see the opportunity to access new markets and new geographies using both software as well as hardware. So we have succeeded in some of the smart city projects that are going on in Asia Pacific \u2013 in the Asia Pacific region, using a new type of integrator that combines NetApp storage with other components of a broad based smart city solution. That\u2019s one example. We will communicate more through the course of the year as news becomes available. But in the broad context, the combination of software assets from NetApp, like ONTAP Select or SolidFire software as well as the opportunity to create new solutions through new pathways makes us believe that OEM is no longer a place which declines, but rather flattens out or starts to grow moderately. Mark Kelleher : Okay. Thanks. Kris Newton : Thanks Mark. Next question? Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Jim Kisner with Jefferies. Your line is now open. James Kisner : That\u2019s James, not Jim, to make sure. So on the \u2013 just a quick clarification, my next sort of question, on \u2013 you mentioned, I think the excess and obviously the inventory helping product margin, I want to make sure that that was still up, helping non-GAAP product margin and maybe you could quantify how much that helped. And then just separately, on just the \u2013 congrats on the minus 7% better mature solutions declines, are there any particular pieces in that business that outperformed that really helped you with that, I guess, you said differently, what\u2019s the product line that did the best year-over-year that drove that result? Thanks. Ron Pasek : So on the \u2013 I was really trying to point out is we had that as a headwind in Q3. It certainly wasn\u2019t there in Q4. The main pieces of benefit were of course better sales execution and the removal of the promo for cDOT. George Kurian : I think with regard to the mature solutions, I think first of all, we had said that as \u2013 the three components of mature solutions were add-on storage, OEM and 7-Mode. And they are increasingly becoming a smaller part of our overall business. So the year-on-year declines in them are frankly, smaller than they would be. The preponderant majority of that business is OEM and add-on storage at this point. And therefore, those will not be, as I said subject to the same rate of declines. 7-Mode is now a much, much smaller percentage of our business. If you think about the shipments out of the factory, they are 95% clustered ONTAP. And so we think that mature overall, as we had said many times, will be a place of stability or modest \u2013 very modest decline going forward. James Kisner : Thanks very much. Kris Newton : Thank you, James. Next question? Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna. Your line is now open. David Ryzhik : Hi. Thanks so much. This is David Ryzhik for Mehdi Hosseini. Your anticipation for accelerating product growth throughout the year, does that include new products such as hyper-converged ramping. And the second part of my question is regarding cDOT migration, what is the strategy with legacy 7-Mode installations given that you are kind of signaling that your \u2013 that it\u2019s behind us, what is the strategy, if any? Thanks. Ron Pasek : So with respect to ramp of new products yes, in fact SolidFire continues to ramp in the year and some other new products that will come along. George Kurian : So we feel good about the portfolio we have to-date that have \u2013 we have just finished a very strong quarter. We think that many of the solutions that we saw this quarter have expanded potential and we will continue to demonstrate additive innovations to the portfolio over the course of the year, stay tuned. With regard to the customer base and the partner channel on clustered ONTAP, we have migrated a substantial percentage of that customer base as we have communicated, 2 clustering from 7-Mode. We have also trained our partner channel and trained our customers to achieve those migrations themselves. So we have given them tools, methodologies and allowed them to shadow us as we help them do the migrations. The remainder of those migrations will happen at the pace that customers take on IT projects. They will be a part of the broader IT agenda of customers. And so we feel very good. We have got the big percentage of our installed base migrated. We have seen real success with both clustered ONTAP and all-flash clustered ONTAP, called All Flash FAS and we think that we have established a compelling value proposition for customers to migrate over the remainder of the installed base. David Ryzhik : Great. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Srini Nandury with Summit Redstone. Your line is now open. Srini Nandury : Alright. Thank you for taking my questions. Congratulations on a good quarter. You mentioned on the call that you are taking out EMC once a day. What products are you displacing? Are those primarily Dell products or EMC or both? George Kurian : We are displacing the EMC products, primarily VMAXs and VNXs as we tear out old SAN environments and replace them with All Flash FAS. We are also looking forward to displacing old Isilon environments with ONTAP 9.2. So we... Srini Nandury : Alright. Thank you, George. Kris Newton : Thank you, Srini. Next question? Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Katy Huberty : Thanks. Good afternoon. Ron, how should we think about operating expense trend for the full year fiscal \u201818 in light of R&D for adjacent markets and some of the go-to-market investments you talked about at the Analyst Day? Ron Pasek : Yes. So what I mentioned at Analyst Day for the 3-year period, it would be roughly flat. I also mentioned we would see a slight bump in \u201818 as we will see given we need to give people raises. But other than that, it\u2019s really pretty much flat to what we would have expected. Just to clarify one additional thing, Katy, what we are clear was that we are just continuing to do transformation that we would be using that as a tool to disinvest and reinvest in the business so that the reinvestment is not all incremental. Kris Newton : Thanks, Katy. Next question? Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Amit Daryanani : Thanks a lot, guys. I guess just a question on the component shortages. And maybe I missed this, but could you quantify what headwind did component shortages or price increases have for you in the April quarter and how do you think of that headwind in July? And if I understand the structure of your \u2013 securing the NAND supply dynamic properly, is it fair to think you have secured the supply, but pricing could still fluctuate and still could have a margin impact? Ron Pasek : That\u2019s right. I was hinting at that last quarter. We do secure the supply for the remainder of the calendar year, but we only do pricing for the next 90 days in advance. So it was about 1 point headwind in the Q4 quarter. It was about 0.5 point as we enter Q1. Kris Newton : Alright. Thanks, Amit. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Rod Hall : Yes, thanks for the question. I just wanted to check on the competitive dynamic, a couple of questions actually on this. One is Dell/EMC significantly increased their channel program at the beginning of the year, especially focused on storage. So I wonder if you could comment on whether you have seen any impacts from that and just kind of how that\u2019s playing out in the market? And then I also wanted to talk a little about these price increases. Do you expect others to do the same? And what do you think the impact on market demand is going to be, your customers going to pause spending as we get toward the back end of this year as they think about NAND eventually clearing and pricing coming back down or do you think people will keep that ongoing? And then lastly, on NAND, I just want to ask that again. I mean, the data points in the quarter suggest that stabilization is not going to happen in the back end of this year as people have thought. Most \u2013 at least some of the suppliers are now pushing out supply/demand breakeven into middle or even into next year. So I wonder if you are thinking that things are going to stabilize at the end of the year. Maybe it\u2019s a little bit optimistic. I would just like to get your comments on that. George Kurian : Okay, that\u2019s a lot of questions, but let me take them in sequence. With regard to EMC channel programs, we have a strong group of channel partners that do a lot of business with NetApp that are focused on NetApp. I think the success of our All Flash FAS products, the success of our competitive programs, the success of FlexPod in an all-flash configuration are all indications of the strength of our channels and the focus that we have. I think EMC may sweep up some of the marginal partners, but they are not the core focus of our channel program. The second is with regard to the pricing dynamics in customers, we are uniquely positioned with clustered ONTAP to enable customers to move workloads between an all-flash configuration and a hybrid flash configuration that combines flash with disk seamlessly. So, we are able to provide customers a choice of both. We did see strength in our hybrid flash platforms this quarter as well, but it\u2019s too early to tell whether that was a reflection of pricing. It would be remiss of me to speculate on what other people would do. I think we felt that it was important for us to stay consistent to prior practice and future practice that we pass through to customers the increases in component costs as well as the decreases in component cost as they happen. Ron Pasek : And then with respect to NAND supply, remember, we have strategic relationships with suppliers that allow us and afford us different dynamics than perhaps other people in the marketplace. So what I said today and previously are still consistent. So, we see our supply being in good shape and should free up later in the year and into next year. Rod Hall : Okay, thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, Rod. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. Your line is now open. Nehal Chokshi : Thank you. The driver on the pullback of the year-over-year growth for the July quarter, I mean, you had 7% year-over-year growth for the April quarter and you are guiding at a midpoint of 2%. Is there a story behind why you are guiding for that pullback on that growth? And I do have a follow-up as well. Ron Pasek : Nothing other than what we indicated at the Analyst Day. So, we really are giving realistic and in some cases conservative estimates and we want to make sure we meet or beat every commitment we made, as we have the last four quarters. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. Is it possible that the year ago comps is a lot easier than it was for the April quarter and that\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s going into that conservatism as well? Ron Pasek : Actually, the year ago Q1 \u2013 Q1 of \u201817 was actually a pretty good quarter. It really was flat for product revenue. It was down slightly on services only, because we had a 13-week quarter versus 14 the year before. So, if anything, it\u2019s a more difficult compare. Nehal Chokshi : That\u2019s what I meant, okay, sorry. And then my follow-up is that it looks like revenue from direct pathways took a step back in terms of the year-over-year growth profile while indirect accelerated. So, is there a story behind what seems to be two different tales for these two different pathways for market? George Kurian : No, nothing substantive there. I think it\u2019s just mix and transactions, timing of transactions. I don\u2019t think there is anything systematic. I think we have had a good progress with our channel partners and we have seen strength in terms of total product revenue growth across both. FlexPod, in particular, we had a really strong year and second half of the year in particular with FlexPod through the FlexPod Advantage and All Flash FAS programs. So I would say that it probably reflects more the strength of the indirect channel through that model. Nehal Chokshi : Okay, thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Nehal. Next question? Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Simon Leopold : Great, thank you. First, I just wanted to clarify within the guidance, I think it seems to imply your operating expenses rise sequentially. And just looking at prior years, sales and marketing sometimes moves up, sometimes moves down on what is typically a seasonally lower revenue quarter. Could you help us understand any of the moving parts that might be influencing OpEx in your July guidance? And then in terms of the broader question, I wanted to ask about the longer term strategy in terms of all flash because you\u2019ve got hyper-converged product coming to market in three different all flash platforms. Is there some thought about trying to consolidate those platforms or looking for more synergies or are there synergies there and just not well appreciated? Thank you. Ron Pasek : Yes. So on the walk on OpEx from Q4 to Q1, it\u2019s simply the fact that we are giving people raises. We are down in Q1 \u201818 versus Q1 a year ago. And again, we are doing some disinvestments and reinvestments. So that is the really simple explanation. That\u2019s it. George Kurian : With regard to your second question, I would say we had very clear swim lanes and use cases that we described for our all-flash array platforms. And that allows customers to make ongoing purchase decisions with confidence in these roadmaps. With regard to offerings of both ONTAP and SolidFire, I would just tell you we have had a tradition of making ONTAP and SolidFire available as standalone systems as part of converged infrastructure, software and as a service model. And what you will see with SolidFire is its offering in a hyper-converged form factor. So it\u2019s consistent with practice. Our customers like the fact that they can operate a storage environment across all of these use cases. It gives them a huge return on both training as well as automation and management and monitoring infrastructure, unlike our competitors who have a different operating system for every single use case. Simon Leopold : Great. Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. Kris Newton : Thanks Simon. Next question? Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with Barclays. Your line is now open. Mark Moskowitz : Yes. Thanks. Good afternoon. Just want to build off of Rod\u2019s question from earlier regarding competitive dynamics, it seems like it could be more than just Dell EMC if we are not mistaken in terms of Pure Storage starting to gain momentum of FlashBlade and also HP Enterprise acquiring Nimble, it just seems like NetApp now is in the crosshairs of a lot of different targets, you are a bull\u2019s eye of some of these other players out there, is this part of the reason why you are being a little more cautious on the guide and not really providing a full year revenue outlook, because you could have a lot more vectors hurting you? George Kurian : Not at all, I think we feel real confident, right. If you look at the strategic portfolio, it accelerated through the year both in terms of its size as a percentage of our business as well as growth rates. Just take a look, last quarter, it was up 22% on product revenue; strategic product revenue this quarter, 24%. Last year, it was 14% at this time. So we feel real good about the product portfolio. I think it\u2019s \u2013 there is two things, right. I think one is we want to make sure that when we give you guidance, we can achieve those estimates and it\u2019s really that. And then the second is we continue to watch the macro. And as we get more color through the course of the year, we will certainly give you a better outlook as it becomes available. But it has got nothing to do with competitive dynamics. If you look at our market share numbers in all-flash arrays, we are outpacing all these guys. I would tell you that some of the competitor moves are desperation moves to catch us rather than us feeling worried about them. Kris Newton : Thank you, Mark. Next question? Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Eric Martinuzzi with Lake Street. Your line is now open. Eric Martinuzzi : Yes. I may have missed this earlier, but what was the headcount \u2013 what did you finish the headcount with for FY \u201817 and what\u2019s your expectation for headcount for FY \u2013 sorry, finish for FY \u201817 and your expectation for FY \u201818? Ron Pasek : So we do not plan to add any net new headcount in FY \u201818. We finished the year at 10,103 employees. Eric Martinuzzi : Got it. Thanks. Kris Newton : Thanks Eric. Next question? Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Erik Suppiger with JMP. Your line is now open. Erik Suppiger : Yes. Can you just expand on the Plexistor acquisition, how big was that? George Kurian : It\u2019s a small number of employees. It is factored into the operating margin guidance that we gave you. So it will not be dilutive to operating margins. And at this point, we are not disclosing the terms of the transaction. Erik Suppiger : Okay. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks Erik. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Jim Suva : Thank you very much. Maybe I am doing my math wrong or something, but can you help me out, is your EPS guidance range bigger now than it has been historically in the past and if my math is correct, can you help us understand why bigger range? Ron Pasek : Yes. What we did last year was had a bigger range to revenue, but it wasn\u2019t mirrored in EPS. So all I did was make them equal, so that it\u2019s more in line with the broader range we had established for revenue. Jim Suva : Got it. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. And your next question comes from John Lucia with JMP Securities. Your line is now open. John Lucia : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to clarify on the revenue growth acceleration throughout FY \u201818, is that total revenue, product revenue or both? Ron Pasek : Both. John Lucia : Okay. And just to be clear again, you are expecting acceleration every single quarter so that Q4 has the highest growth rate, correct? Ron Pasek : That would be our \u2013 well, not necessarily growth rate, but it would have our highest \u2013 it would be our highest revenue quarter for the year and that would be our traditional seasonal pattern, yes. John Lucia : Okay. And then with respect to the NAND supply, you said that NetApp is well positioned because you have the ability to sell the hybrid and bring the price down given the HCD components, are customers really adjusting their purchasing decisions, because of a slightly \u2013 a slight price increase, it seems like if a customer settles on an all-flash solution, it\u2019s kind of a long-term strategic decision that wouldn\u2019t be influenced or changed to go to a hybrid solution by short-term pricing increases, so if you could elaborate on that, that would be helpful? George Kurian : Yes. Flash still has \u2013 even with an increase in the cost of an SSD on $1 per gigabyte basis, flash still has compelling advantages from a total cost of ownership, right, density, power consumption, operational benefits. So there is a lot of other reasons why people would continue to choose flash. I think what we find is, we continued to have this benefit that when we position our solution to customers, they can buy into an architecture that ensures them against material moves in the price, right. Unlike our competitors who only have an all-flash storage system, we can go ahead and tell a customer, buy our clustered ONTAP architecture. And you know what, if the price of flash goes up substantially for a period of time, you can deployed a disk-based solution or a hybrid solution for those discretionary workloads that absolutely do not need an all-flash environment, right. And that\u2019s really how we position it. Flash continues to have material advantages over disk from a total cost of ownership perspective. That needs to be factored into the calculations. John Lucia : Okay. Thank you very much. Kris Newton : Thanks John. Next question? Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thanks. Ron, sorry if I missed this, but can you just comment on the OpEx seasonality through the course of the year? Thanks. Ron Pasek : Yes. I mean as I said, we see a little bump up in Q1 simply because we are giving people raises. Absent that, what you tend to see is it follow essentially variable comp, which would be higher in the second half of the year and that\u2019s really about it. Again, we are in a net zero headcount growth environment, so you shouldn\u2019t see any growth in headcount causing any cyclicality in OpEx. Wamsi Mohan : Okay. Thanks. Kris Newton : Thank you. Yes. Thank you, Wamsi. I will turn it back to George for closing comments. George Kurian : Thanks Kris. We successfully completed the first phase of our transformation. We delivered against all our commitments for fiscal year \u201817 and returned the company to growth with expanded earnings growth. We are well positioned for sustained growth going forward. The majority of our systems business is in the high growth all-flash array market and the market is in the early days of the shift from disk to flash. Our compelling hyper-converged infrastructure solution will leapfrog the first generation HCI products by bringing HCI to the enterprise with cloud integration and the ability to run multiple workloads on a shared infrastructure. And we continue to expand our opportunity through organic and inorganic innovation. Entering the next phase of our transformation, we will focus on three priorities; expanding our opportunity with continued emphasis on the growth areas of the market, the way we deliver our solutions and reaching new buyers, making fundamental changes to enable reinvestment in the business while continuing to drive the expansion of our operating margins, as we have demonstrated this year and continuing our robust and balanced capital allocation program. Thank you to all our partners and shareholders for supporting us during this period of transition. And I want to say a special thank you to the NetApp team for leading into transformation and accelerating our turnaround. I am proud of our progress and especially of you, our world class team. I look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference call. This does conclude the program. And you may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.",

Welcome to NetApp\u2019s First Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and answer-session and instructions will be given at that time. I will now turn the call over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Kris Newton : Hello and thank you for joining us on our Q1 fiscal year 2018 earnings call. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Ron Pasek. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com along with the earnings release, our financial tables and guidance, a historical supplemental data table and the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation. As a reminder, during today\u2019s call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2018 and our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons, including global political macroeconomic and market conditions and our ability to expand our total available market, enhance our product offerings, execute new business models, manage our gross profit margins, capitalize on our market position, maintain execution and continue our capital allocation strategy. Please also refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC, specifically our most recent Form 10-K for fiscal year 2017 and our current reports on Form 8-K, all of which can be found on our website. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP, unless otherwise indicated. I will now turn the call over to George. George Kurian : Thanks, Kris. Welcome, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. With focused market-leading innovation and disciplined execution, we delivered a strong start to fiscal year 2018. Revenue was above the midpoint of our guidance range and gross margin, operating margin and earnings per share were all above our guidance. NetApp is winning because we deliver solutions that enable our customers to harness the value of their data and thrive in a digital world. In addition to delivering solid results across the board, we further strengthened our leadership position by enhancing our all-flash array and converged infrastructure offerings, and augmenting our Data Fabric strategy. We expanded our strategic partnership with Microsoft Azure and introduced new hybrid cloud software solutions. The accelerating turnaround of NetApp underscores our unique technology leadership and expanding opportunity. As I have said before, NetApp is transforming to align our strategic focus, investments and execution with the changing needs of our customers. The first phase of our transformation put us on a solid foundation by shifting our business to the growth areas of the market, bringing our cost structure in line with our opportunities, and substantially improving our leadership capability and execution. As we shift to the second phase of our transformation, we are building on that foundation to deliver sustained and profitable growth. We are focused on three key priorities. First, to drive sustained top line growth, we will remain focused on the high growth areas of the market, as well as address new customers and new buying centers at existing customers. Second, to increase profitability as we grow, we will continue our disciplined approach to realign our resources against the biggest opportunities and to focus on productivity to expand our innovation. And third, we will maintain our focus on capital allocation, balancing shareholder returns with investment in the business for long-term growth. Like NetApp, our customers are transforming to grow revenue and improve productivity. Through new digital business models and the Internet of Things, companies are harnessing the power of their data to enable new customer touch points, uncover business opportunities, and optimize operations. These imperatives require advanced data management capabilities and the new class of hybrid cloud data services. To address these needs, NetApp is delivering a Data Fabric that simplifies and integrates data management across cloud and on-premises environments. With our solutions, services and partnerships, we empower our customers to harness the power of the hybrid could, build next-generation data centers and modernize storage through data management. In addition to driving technical innovations, we have aligned our go-to-market teams, to focus on the strategic solutions in our portfolio, aligned sales resources to acquire new customers and attack new buying centers, improved sales discipline to expand gross margin, and are leveraging our unique position to access customers through multiple pathways tailored to their needs. Our $55 billion market opportunity consists of legacy segments that are in decline and newer segments that are growing rapidly, driven by digital transformation. We have already transitioned our business away from the declining segments to the data-driven high-growth segments of all-flash arrays, converged infrastructure, and hybrid cloud. We will further expand our opportunity with the general availability of our hyper-converged solutions, later this calendar year. Let me discuss the results we have had in these high growth markets, before turning to innovation and customer success. We continued to substantially outpace the growth of the all-flash array market and competitors, both large and small in that space. In Q1, our all-flash array business inclusive of All Flash FAS, EF and SolidFire products and services grew 95% year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run rate of $1.5 billion. Our strength in flash is also driving our success in SAN and converged infrastructure markets. Our share gains in the SAN market reflect our acquisition of new customers and new share of wallet within existing customers. The All Flash FlexPod helped strengthen our number two position in the converged infrastructure market and contributed to the 26% year-over-year growth of FlexPod revenue reported in IDC\u2019s quarterly converged systems tracker for calendar Q1 2017. We are outpacing and winning against full-stack vendors with our best-of-breed solution. The success of our strategic direction is evident in the continued momentum in our strategic solutions which were 69% of net product revenue in Q1, up 22% year-over-year. The industry is in the early innings of the move from disk-based storage to flash as customers modernize existing datacenters and build next generation datacenters to lower the total cost of ownership while gaining greater speed and responsiveness from key business applications. We have a significant growth opportunity ahead as we penetrate our installed base and displace competitors\u2019 installations with our cloud integrated all-flash solutions. NetApp is leading this transition to flash by providing customers with solutions that deliver unrivaled scale, speed and data services. Validating the innovation leadership and momentum of our all-flash array business, Gartner again recognized NetApp as a Leader in its Magic Quadrant for Solid-State Arrays. In the quarter, we increased the storage efficiency of our All Flash FAS solutions with expanded in line deduplication across multiple pools of storage. Just last week at the Flash Memory Summit, we demonstrated future flash storage innovations of NVMe over Fabric and storage-class memory. NetApp is uniquely positioned to deliver these new innovations because our approach allows our customers to non-disruptively integrate these advancements into their ONTAP and SolidFire data management architectures. Customers are also choosing the All Flash FAS to replace legacy tier 1 SAN installations because of its performance and density combined with industry-leading data management capabilities. At a U.S.-based financial services company, we replaced a competitor\u2019s SAN installation with our All Flash FAS system, which provide a unified scale out architecture and the resilience needed for tier 1 workloads, and are also modular enough to accommodate the customer\u2019s future datacenter consolidation plans. We consolidated SAN and NAS workloads into a single platform, allowing the company to leverage ONTAP as its data management standard. New innovations further strengthened our leadership position in the converged infrastructure market. In Q1, we introduced FlexPod SF, a SolidFire-based converged infrastructure solution that enables digital transformation with high-end predictable performance, programmable agility, and scale out value for multi-tenant environments. Enterprises, cloud service providers and partners choose NetApp because we enable their hybrid cloud strategies through our Data Fabric architecture. Our approach to hybrid cloud enabled us to make a first-time ever sale to a global leader in the hospitality industry. The customer had spent a significant amount of time and money unsuccessfully trying to realize their cloud mandate with a competitive solution. After purchasing ONTAP Cloud and ONTAP Select licenses, they were able to move a tier 1 application on to ONTAP Cloud running in AWS over a single weekend, and it now runs faster than it had on the competitor\u2019s on-premises solution. This win positions us to not only be the data management platform of choice for their cloud workloads, but also to migrate their on-premises infrastructure from the competitor to NetApp. The NetApp Data Fabric, simplifies data management across the cloud and on-premises footprint to deliver consistent and integrated hybrid cloud data services, enabling customers to unleash the full power of their data. We continue to innovate in this space, and in Q1, we unreached our solutions, services and partnerships for hybrid cloud data services. We enhanced OnCommand Insight to provide hybrid cloud infrastructure and monitoring and analytics across the Data Fabric. We also expanded ONTAP functionality to deliver automatic and transparent tiering of inactive data to the cloud. At the start of Q2, we acquired Green Cloud, a private startup company that created a cloud services, orchestration and management platform for hybrid cloud and multi-cloud environments. Green Cloud augments our team and accelerates our leadership in hybrid services by providing NetApp with the scalable architecture, unique technology and expertise that enhances our ability to integrate and deliver cloud data services. Additionally, we announced the expansion of our collaboration with Microsoft to include hybrid cloud data services that will deliver enterprise-grade data visibility and insights, data access and control, and data protection and security for customers moving to Microsoft Azure. We will provide updates on this exciting collaboration later this calendar year. In a hybrid cloud data-driven world, we have an unprecedented opportunity to strengthen and grow our business. Our Data Fabric vision and architecture is being endorsed by not only customers and industry influencers, but also the world\u2019s leading hyperscalers. Our focus, discipline and emphasis on execution has returned NetApp to growth with expanding margins, increased shareholder value and improving momentum. We saw continued growth in Q1 and expect to accelerate that growth in Q2 and throughout the year. We are helping our customers change the world with data, and that is driving our success. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ron to walk through our Q1 financial performance and go-forward expectations. Ron? Ron Pasek : Thanks, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you that I\u2019ll be referring to non-GAAP numbers today. With that, let\u2019s get started. NetApp delivered another quarter of disciplined execution and strong financial performance, demonstrating the substantial progress we\u2019ve made toward transforming the business, driving sustained growth, and addressing the changing market. Q1 net revenues of $1.33 billion grew 2% year-over-year and were above the midpoint of our guidance range. Product revenue of $723 million increased 10% year-over-year. This was a third consecutive quarter of year-over-year product revenue growth, driven by our successful pivot to the growth areas of the market. The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance, and other services revenues of $602 million were down 5% year-over-year. This decline was driven by the following factors : Changes we made to the service pricing several years ago; renewal execution issues in FY 2017; and several years of product revenue declines. It is important to note that total systems under contract increased slightly year-over-year. Although, we generally don\u2019t provide services revenue guidance, we expect the year-over-year headwind for services revenue to lessen in the next several quarters and return to growth in the beginning of the next fiscal year. We are confident in these expectations as our product revenue has returned to growth, and we are seeing improvement in renewal execution from changes that we implemented at the beginning of this fiscal year. Gross margin of 63.8% was well above our guidance range. Product gross margin of 49.9%, increased approximately 3 points year-over-year due to improved sales discipline. Software maintenance gross margin was relatively flat year-over-year, while hardware maintenance and other services gross margin increased about 2 points year-over-year. Operating expenses of $637 million decreased 2% year-over-year and as expected increased 3% sequentially. As I discussed during our financial analyst day, the sequential increase was primarily due to merit increases. As a percent of net revenue, operating expenses of 48%, represented almost 2.5 points of improvement year-over-year, reflecting the benefit of our ongoing transformation efforts. Operating margin of 15.8% increased almost 4 points year-over-year and was above our guidance range due to higher revenue, higher gross margin, and lower operating expenses. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.4% and weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 278 million. EPS of $0.62 was $0.05 above the high-end of our guidance range due to higher revenue and improved gross margins. We closed Q1 with $5.3 billion in cash and short-term investments with approximately 8% held by our domestic entities. In Q1, we repurchased $150 million of our shares and paid approximately $54 million in cash dividends. Today, we also announced our next cash dividend of $0.20 per share, which will be paid on October 25, 2017. To reiterate, we are committed to completing by the end of May 2018 the remaining $644 million of the share repurchase program that we announced in February 2015. Deferred and financed unearned services revenue was down just over 1% year-over-year due to the same dynamics that drove the decline in services revenue, I discussed earlier. Our cash conversion cycle extended 3 days year-over-year, reflecting a 12-day increase in days inventory outstanding due to higher levels of SSD raw materials on hand, partially offset by a 10-day improvement in days payable outstanding as a result of our transformation initiatives. DSO at 36 days was relatively flat year-over-year. As I noted last quarter, we continue to exercise our deep business and technical partnerships with our NAND and SSD suppliers. We have enough on-hand and committed supply of NAND to meet our requirements now through the end of our fiscal year. Q1 cash flow from operations was $250 million, an increase of 10% year-over-year. We generated strong free cash flow of $214 million in the quarter; this represents about 16% of net revenues and is an increase of 11% year-over-year. Now onto guidance. We executed well against our plans in Q1 and are pleased with the significant progress we\u2019ve made toward transforming NetApp to succeed in the changing market. We\u2019re making tough decisions that enable key investments to expand our TAM and drive strong financial performance over the long term. While we still have work to do, we remain confident in our ability to continue to execute against the plans we outlined for fiscal 2018, on our prior earnings call. To reiterate, we expect our typical seasonal patterns with revenue dollars increasing each quarter. We also expect our year-over-year growth rate to accelerate in the back half of the fiscal year. We expect gross margin of 62% to 63% and operating margin of 18% to 20%. Further, we remain committed to delivering low double-digit EPS growth for the year and free cash flow in the range of 17% to 19% of revenue. Now onto Q2. We expect net revenue to range between $1.31 billion and $1.46 billion, which at the midpoint, implies approximately 4.5% growth sequentially and 3.4% growth year-over-year. We expect Q2 consolidated gross margin of approximately 63% to 63.5%, reflecting a higher mix of product revenues quarter-to-quarter. We expect operating margins of approximately 16% to 17%. And finally, we expect earnings per share for the second quarter to range from approximately $0.64 to $0.72 per share. In closing, Q1 was another strong quarter of execution, reflecting a leverage in our business model with 2% year-over-year revenue growth yielding a 35% increase in year-over-year EPS growth. We are pleased with the substantial progress we\u2019ve made to transform the business, drive sustained growth and increase shareholder value. With that, I will hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris? Kris Newton : We\u2019ll now open the call for Q&A. Please be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to one question, so we can get to as many people as possible. Thanks for your cooperation. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Joe Wittine of Longbow Research. Your line is now open. Joe Wittine : Hi, thanks. If I just have one here, how about a competitive question? Product sales of close to 10% again, how are you seeing the competition respond, specifically with discounting? Have they stepped it up yet or if not, do you expect that to be the next logical step? Thanks. George Kurian : It\u2019s always been competitive. We have substantial technology differentiation in big and early markets, all-flash arrays, converged infrastructure, hybrid cloud, and we\u2019re executing to our plan. Every deal is competitive, HP, Dell/EMC, Pure Storage, and some of the smaller vendors, everyone competes fiercely on the whole range of things at their disposal. The fact that we have grown substantially, gained share in virtually every category in our business, and have expanded gross margins substantially in both product and services is clear support for our thesis that we have a unique differentiated position of technology leadership, as well as partnerships, and customers are voting with their wallet in our favor. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Leopold of Raymond James. Your line is open. Simon Leopold : Maybe following up on competitive landscape. From our discussions with the channel and customers, we\u2019ve got the impression that you benefited for some time from maybe disruption at number of your large competitors, whether it was HP and its spin mergers or Dell/EMC and their integration; these two activities are going to lap at some point. Could you help us understand, how you see the competitive environment shaping up in terms of those two large competitors, as we look out over the next year or so and they are lapping their integration activities? George Kurian : I clearly think from a technology standpoint and direction standpoint, there are multiple avenues where we are sustainably differentiated. From the technology standpoint, all-flash arrays, converged infrastructure, storage, resource management, as well as the evolving market for hyper-converged, we have very, very good solutions that are clearly differentiated, both in -- the technology that\u2019s available today as well as those that are to come, both HP and Dell have major holes in their portfolio for the evolution of the all-flash array market. And clearly, we are demonstrating massive differentiation in terms of performance and execution in the converged infrastructure market which is frankly their home turf. None of these guys have a clear coherent hybrid cloud storage. And so we feel very, very good about our position in the market and are confident. We are in the early stages of the evolution of these markets and yes, they have their own execution challenges to get over, but clearly we feel that we\u2019ve got a really solid lead against them and they\u2019re going to have to come catch us, which is going to take them heck of a long time. Operator : Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of Susquehanna Group. Your question please. Dave Ryzhik : Hi, thanks. This is Dave Ryzhik for Mehdi. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to clarify in the deferred revenue commentary, Ron. It sounds like services becomes less of headwind. Now, do you expect services to exit fiscal 2018 at growth? And just digging a little deeper on the renewal execution. Was that pricing, did you guys aggressively price, because hardware maintenance declined, I think 8% year-over-year? I just wanted to dig a little deeper there? Thank you. Ron Pasek : Yes. Thanks, Dave. So we -- I touched on this last quarter as well. Just a reminder, our services revenue is made up of a waterfall and annuity if you will over the last three, four years of transactions. We did make some pricing changes, both at the beginning of FY 2017 and actually back into 2013; we lowered ASPs to become more competitive. However, as you saw that did not affect our services margins. In fact, the services margins have increased the last several quarters. Added to that, we had several years before Q3 of last year of product revenue declines, we have turned that around; that should help in the second half of this year. And we did have some service execution issues in this back half of FY 2017. So, we have largely focused on place on renewal execution issues. And that\u2019s why I am confident as we continue this fiscal year, the headwind will lessen, and I think you will see services revenue turn around and get back to growth in Q1 of 2019. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Milunovich of UBS. Your line is open. Steve Milunovich : Yes. Thank you. Regarding your all flash product. In terms of the quarter\u2019s shipments, is all flash over half of what you are delivering from an array standpoint and do you still feel that the margins are -- you are pretty neutral between all flash versus disk? George Kurian : That\u2019s correct. It\u2019s about the -- it\u2019s about 50%, and we feel very good about the trajectory and the margins of all flash vis-\u00e0-vis hybrid. Operator : Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Your question, please? Wamsi Mohan : Yes, thank you. I was wondering how the maintenance attached for the flash product compares to the overall portfolio. And is that part of the reason why the hardware maintenance was down a fair amount despite the easy compares, in addition to other things that you highlighted, Ron? Ron Pasek : So, Wamsi, no, the attach rate is no different on all flash versus spinning disk. And no, it had nothing to do with why service was down. It really was ASP which we did, we planned on doing, and to some extent renewal execution from last year which affects this year more than anything else. Wamsi Mohan : If I could, a quick clarification. It appears from your guidance that OpEx could be up year-on-year. Is that consistent with your expectations or is that a change from prior expectations? Thank you. Ron Pasek : Yes. OpEx in Q2 is up very slightly. It\u2019s three factors. One is foreign exchange, it was about $4 million as you bridge Q1 to Q2. The other is the acquisition George mentioned, which is Green Cloud that\u2019s additive to our OpEx. And then, we simply have more variable compensation in Q2. So, was your question, Wamsi, on year-over-year OpEx increase? Wamsi Mohan : Yes, year-over-year. Ron Pasek : Yes, it\u2019s just some calendarization and no structural issues. As I mentioned, full year OpEx is only up slightly, essentially just for merit increases. Operator : Next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi of Lake Street Capital. Your line is open. Eric Martinuzzi : Yes. Curious about your estimation of installed base penetration on the flash product that to me seems like probably the low-hanging fruit here in the success you are seeing on the product side. George Kurian : We are in the very early innings of our installed based. It\u2019s less than 10%. And as we said, we\u2019ve gained share in the SAN market which has been the predominant location for all flash storage. We feel very, very good about our position in the all flash NAS market. And as you know, we won many, many awards year-over-year for technological leadership. So, as we see the market for NAS transition as well, we have substantial room to go. Operator : Next question comes from Maynard Um of Wells Fargo. Your question, please? Maynard Um : Hi, thank you. Can you just update us on the changes to your go-to-market and to the compensation. I think it\u2019s now been a little more than three months, and doesn\u2019t look like, there was much of an impact, but curious what impact you\u2019re seeing or if it\u2019s too early to kind of see what the full impact of those changes are? George Kurian : I think, the things that you should focus in on is the improved results on product revenue and gross margin were due to the compensation changes we\u2019ve made. We\u2019ve also allowed resources to hunt versus farm our installed based, which is allowing us to accelerate our momentum against the competition by acquiring new accounts and new wallet share in existing accounts. So, we feel very, very good about the changes that we\u2019ve made. In terms of renewals, we brought renewed organizational focus as single owner for renewals execution across the company and we\u2019ve got a disciplined approach that makes us feel much more confident about our execution plan. We feel good about the progress year-to-date. We still have more work to do, but early signs are good. Maynard Um : And then, can you just walk us through some of your vertical markets, places where you\u2019re seeing strengths and softness? And what you\u2019re anticipating in terms of your guidance next quarter from U.S. government? Thanks. George Kurian : Broadly speaking, we don\u2019t have any specific commentary across the different vertical markets. We see a good balanced book of business and see strength across broad range. All of our Peters [ph] executed well. I mean, if you look at our public sector business, it is essentially mirrors the administration spending priorities. We saw strength in the Department of Defense and relative balance, and the civilian segment or public sector, we think that this will be a normal end of year flush budget. And we feel good about our market share position. We\u2019ve got a broad reach into the market, clearly differentiated technology and long-term relationships with the customers, and feel good about our position there. Operator : Our next question comes from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Katy Huberty : Ron, product margins were up year-on-year and sequential. So, can you just talk to what the drivers were? And when we think about the next few quarters, where could product margins go, assuming memory prices remain elevated and then where do you think that could go longer term in NAND prices ease? Ron Pasek : So, I think we were pretty clear that one other focus areas for us was product margins. We believe that we were not executing as well as we thought. We did make some changes to compensation as George indicated. I think at our Analyst Day, I didn\u2019t give specific guidance on where product margins would leave -- would end up. But I do think we\u2019re executing well. I think what you\u2019ll see is baked in some of the guidance we gave for the full year of the 62% to 63%. And ultimately, I think that when we have our Analyst Day next year, I\u2019ll give you guide on FY 2019. But I still think we have some ways to go. Operator : Next question comes from Andrew Nowinski of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Andrew Nowinski : Thanks for taking the question. A lot of them have been asked, but just a question on SolidFire. I think last year, it was 2% of your total revenue. I know you made some changes to the -- having trained the broader sales forces start selling now versus using specialists. So, I\u2019m just wondering if you could give us any traction on or any color on the traction SolidFire has had this quarter and what you think you can do going forward? Thanks. George Kurian : SolidFire has been integrated into NetApp go-to-market organization and into the product group. We feel good about the integration so far. We\u2019ve enabled our field sellers as well as our channel partners to be able to sell the technology. It\u2019s part of our strategic portfolio and we\u2019ve accelerated innovations in that portfolio this quarter. In Q1, we announced FlexPod SS, a converged infrastructure solution combining Cisco computer network together with SolidFire storage and data management, we\u2019re excited to bring that to the market and we started to see positive reviews from that. And as we\u2019ve said before, you\u2019ll see us bring a SolidFire base hyper converged solution to market later this calendar year. So, overall, steady as we go. We still have more work to do but we feel good about the work that we\u2019ve done so far. Operator : Our next question comes from Jayson Noland of Baird. Your question, please? Jayson Noland : Okay, great. I wanted to ask on NetApp HCI, George, GA. In calendar Q4, I assume you\u2019ve got some betas in the field. I guess, what are your expectations for the second half of this fiscal year? And is this solution competitive to Nutanix and VSAN or is it sort of a different part of the market. George Kurian : I think, first of all, we have multiple avenues to accelerate the momentum of NetApp. Clearly, we\u2019ve demonstrated that in the all-flash array category and the converged infrastructure category. We have more exciting announcements around the cloud and other areas of our business that you should come to insight to hear about. With regard to the hyper converged solution, as we said, our approach is to bring to the enterprise, an enterprise-grade hyper converged solution that deals with some of the challenges that first generation hyper converged solutions like VSAN and Nutanix has. This is the ability deliver a guaranteed mixed workload performance to have modular scalability and upgradability of your storage environment, and your compute environment as well as to deploy mission-critical workloads like databases and other things beyond VDI, which is where the primary first generation vendors are. So, we feel good. The early reviews of it have been positive from the industry analysts and from the customers and partners that we\u2019ve shared, which really more come to insight. Operator : Next question comes from Alex Kurtz of KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open. Alex Kurtz : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. George, if you guys continue to execute on the product front here, double-digit growth, could you see kind of revisiting the OpEx growth rates for the business and maybe stepping it up, given some of the dislocation of some of the larger OEMs you compete against? George Kurian : No, we\u2019re going to continue to stay disciplined. Right? We\u2019ve provided guidance for the year. We think that continuing to prioritize the markets that we compete in and our approach to access customers through partners is a good way to grow our business. We\u2019re seeing the early results and they\u2019ve proven good. We think that we can certainly accelerate the top-line in the second half of the year as we said through the course of the year, because of the momentum we\u2019re seeing. But we\u2019re going to continue to stay disciplined. Ron Pasek : I would just add that what we talked about at Analyst Day was that transformation was not an event that something we do ongoing. So, we believe we still have work to do; that\u2019s why we believe we can hold our cost structure roughly flat. Operator : Next question comes from James Kisner of Jefferies. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi guys. David [ph] for James. Quick question, so, obviously you\u2019ve had very good adoption of strategic revenue. I just wanted to ask question, you saw sequential decline in the proportion of products revenue that was strategic versus legacy. And also, it looks like this is the first time you\u2019ve seen a sequential decline in run rate for the all-flash array. Is there something going on with customer adoption or just who\u2019s ordering when in the year that is causing that? George Kurian : I think just a couple of things. In terms of the mature business, as we\u2019ve said consistently, mature does not go to zero. Right? There are three components to mature, add-on storage, the OEM business, and 7-Mode. And of those three, the only thing that really goes away over a period of time is 7-Mode, which is already a very, very small number. The mature business did -- we saw the add-on storage component of the mature business grow quite substantially because of the strength of our product revenue in the strategic site to which add-on storage gets attached. That\u2019s the first point. The second is, with regard to seasonality in the all-flash array business. It\u2019s a big business now. And so we saw the natural seasonality in our business on the sequential side. If you compare year-on-year, however, we\u2019re dramatically outpacing the market and our business is big numbers. And we intend to sustain that year-on-year momentum through the fiscal year. Operator : Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Amit Daryanani : Thanks a lot and thanks for taking my question, guys. I guess to start with, just on your product growth number that you\u2019ve had so far, a question get asked a lot of time on NetApp is, what\u2019s your ability to sustain this product growth as you get to the back half of the year in the Jan and April quarters when compares presumably get tougher? So, just maybe help us understand, what are the two, three big levers you have that can show positive product growth in the back half? Thank you. George Kurian : I think there are sort of three of four things that I would say, Amit. I think the first is, we have clear differentiated technology leadership and momentum in large markets like all-flash arrays, converged infrastructure and the hybrid cloud where we are in the early innings of a multiyear transition of very, very large enterprise infrastructures. And we\u2019re demonstrating our technology leadership by outpacing competitors of all sizes and shapes. The second is that our portfolio is going to expand through the course of the year. Without telling you more, I would ask you to come to NetApp Insight and see some of the exciting innovations that we have. We\u2019ve demonstrated some of them at Flash Memory Summit. Clearly, hyper converge is another arrow in our quiver, it\u2019s for the second half of the year. But, we have multiple ways to accelerate the momentum of our business through the fiscal year, and we feel very confident about that. Operator : The next question comes from Srini Nandury of Summit Redstone. Your line is open. UnidentifiedAnalyst: All right. Thank you for taking my question. This is Amit again. [Ph] George, can you comment on your conversations you\u2019re having with your channel partners, technical partners and customers on the upcoming HCI product and more importantly, do any of your customers currently have this product on beta trial or early access? Thank you. George Kurian : As I said, I think HCI is one of many avenues for growth of NetApp. Our approach to HCI is to deliver enterprise-grade data services and modular flexibility that allows customers to deploy production workloads and mixed infrastructures on an HCI is different from the first generation HCI vendors. And so, we have had early demos and feedback from partners who are excited about it. Clearly, we got to get in the market and start to accelerate momentum, once we are in the market, but we feel good so far, clearly differentiated approach just like we brought to the solid-state storage market where we have already for the enterprise customers used the solid-state technology, not the early adopter niche providers. And so, we feel good about where we are. Operator : Next question comes from Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your line is open. Steven Fox : Thanks. Good afternoon. Just one question for me please. You mentioned that mix is going to help your gross margin this quarter. Can you be a little bit more specific on what mix drivers are most important and then what you are thinking in terms of, directionally, about mix and margins in the rest of the fiscal year? Thanks. Ron Pasek : Yes. Sorry, Steven. I think what you\u2019ll see on mix is that a portion of product revenue -- product margin to total revenue margin will be up in Q2. Service revenue is basically flat, which are higher revenue and higher margin -- I am sorry, higher margin. So, the mix question really is just between product and services margin, and it\u2019s a slight headwind to margin in Q2, still above the 63% but a slight headwind. And what I said was, as you go to through the year, product revenue continues to grow, so all things being equal, it is a little bit of a headwind to margin on the total margin basis. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Suva of Citi. Your line is open. Jim Suva : Thank you very much. The details have been great so far. I have one question. In your prepared comments, you talked about some success, what I believe was Azure, cloud provider  Azure. Can you help us understand, when you look at the relationship long-term, do you expect it to kind of mirror [ph] your portfolio as far as product versus software versus services or is it more leaned towards one of those three buckets, or how should we think about that and the profitability as such? Thank you so much. George Kurian : I think it\u2019s early to comment about the specifics of the Microsoft relationship. We will have more news later this calendar year. We are really excited about the collaboration because it is multi-faceted. On the cloud side, it\u2019s developing new cloud data services based on NetApp ONTAP innovation that will be offered on the Azure cloud. And it will allow us to not only enable our customers to be successful in hybrid cloud architectures and deployment, but also will bring multiple competitors workloads to NetApp infrastructure on-premises as well as to the public cloud. On-premises, we have agreed to engineering collaboration to deliver an integrated solution architecture that combines Azure and Azure stock with NetApp ONTAP, so that customers can unlock greater value from their data and speed the migration of enterprise apps to that next-generation architecture. And we are also working with Microsoft on integrating our data fabric technology, technologies like our FabricPool, automated storage tiering technology, or to enable our Cloud Control, backup archival and compliance solution for Office 365, so it\u2019s a broad-based multidimensional relationship, and we think that it will be a substantial differentiator for us in the market and is going to be sustainably differentiated for multiple years on a very, very broad basis. So stay tuned. We are really excited to tell you more as the services come to market. Operator : Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Sherri Scribner : Hi. Ron, I was just curious on the gross margin along the full year guidance, 62% to 63%. Clearly, you are above that and guiding to higher than that in second quarter. So, the first half well above that rate. I know you said product gross margins would pressure the margins in the second half of the year; over the past couple of years, you haven\u2019t seen that much pressure. So, I guess my question is, is that number a conservative or do you really expect gross margins to be below that 62%, which is where it would be to get to that 62%, 63% for the full year? Thanks. Ron Pasek : Yes. No, I think what I was trying to say, Sherri, is that it is simply the mix of product margin versus services margin in the second half is much higher that puts a little pressure on the overall margin rate. But the product margins that you are seeing in Q1 and what\u2019s implied in Q2 should hold. So, I think what we are saying is it\u2019s just a mix issue between the products and services margins. That\u2019s it. Operator : Next question comes from Mark Kelleher of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Mark Kelleher : Yes, thanks for taking the questions. Most of mine have been asked. But Ron, I was just looking at the balance sheet, the commercial paper notes were up. Can you just touch on that, what\u2019s that, that was up pretty significantly? Ron Pasek : Yes. So, -- and I touched on this at the Analyst Day; there was a question about whether we would be in more debt to complete the share repurchase program that we have in place. And we did in fact acquired about $400 million more in commercial paper. And that\u2019s simply to complete that commitment. We have about $644 million left which we should be done with rest of that by the end of May of 2018. Operator : Next question comes from Mark Moskowitz of Barclays. Your question please. Mark Moskowitz : Thank you. Good afternoon. Just want to come back to services attach. Can you help us understand, if your system install activity is doing quite well, is that really implying that your services or maintenance attach is a lot less per customer, and is that as incentive to win more business or is that reflective of all-flash arrays just don\u2019t require as much spares and maintenance? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Ron Pasek : Yes. So, Mark, when you sell a new system, be it flash or anything else, you sell a three-year service contract. You recognize the revenue ratably every month over the life of that contract. So, yes, our attach rate on these systems is actually quite good. But it doesn\u2019t move the services number to any great extent because it\u2019s a huge number to move. So, most of the variance you are seeing is as I said, pricing changes we made several years ago, and then renewals on other things coming up for renewal that are older systems where we have improved our execution but did have some execution issues in the second half of last year. Operator : Next question comes from Nehal Chokshi of Maxim Group. Your line is open. Nehal Chokshi : Yes, thanks for the question. So, look, you guys put up 10% year-over-year growth on the product revenue, that\u2019s off really difficult comps and the prior quarter hit 12% year-over-year growth on the product revenue. So, this seems to be very strong growth and yes, you have the installed based, you had three years of year-over-year decline, so that\u2019s a little bit of challenge. But once that normalizes out, why shouldn\u2019t you guys be more confident that you can do much better than the low single-digit year-over-year growth that you have been talking about? George Kurian : We feel very good about our position. As we said, we have differentiated technology partnerships and pathways to market across three or four very large markets that are in the early innings of their development, all-flash arrays, converged infrastructure and hybrid cloud. I think what we are focused on is executing, executing flawlessly. You\u2019ve seen us post good numbers. We\u2019ve got do that through the course of this year, and we see accelerating momentum as we said, through the second half of this year. And you know what, we\u2019ll provide more guidance as we see the execution plans play out. But so far, we feel extremely good. And as we said, we are substantial and differentiated technology leadership against competitors, both big and small, and they\u2019ve got a long way to catch us. Operator : Our last question comes from Rod Hall of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Rod Hall : Great. Thanks guys for fitting me in there. I just had two. I noticed that your inventory levels are down just a little bit on last quarter. And so, I wanted to just check in on your -- where you\u2019re at with memory hedging, NAND hedging. Do you have enough supply to kind of keep you hedged on the margins for a couple of more quarters or where do we stand at? And then I also wanted to come back to the sales execution point, the new I guess sales comp or incentive program. What surprised you there? Clearly, this margin was surprisingly good. Were you just surprised about how quickly the sales team took out those new programs, or can you give us a little bit more color about what the positive surprise there was? Thanks. Ron Pasek : So, let\u2019s start with inventory. So, inventory has a normal seasonal pattern; it should decrease from Q4, because that\u2019s our highest quarter. What I tried to articulate in my prepared remarks is we did -- if you look at inventory year-over-year, Q1 this year versus last year, it could go up and simply and mostly because of positions we did take on the end supply. So that was conscious and something we thought the right thing to do. I\u2019ll start on the compensation. So, I think typically what we see is, when we pay people to do things, they do them. And I think in this case, we had what we said is we had paid some of sales management to focus on gross margin and this year we\u2019re paying all sales management to focus on gross margin; it\u2019s having a good effect and the intended effect. Rod Hall : NAND question, guys. Could you just say how far out you\u2019re hedged at this point? Is it a couple of quarters, is it further\u2026 Ron Pasek : What I said in my remarks is that we have secured supply to now the end of our fiscal year. So, until April of next year. George Kurian : The last time we updated you guys, it was till the end of our calendar year; this time, it\u2019s till the end of our fiscal year. So, we\u2019ve got good technological and commercial relationships with the leading NAND suppliers and we\u2019ve got supply assured till the end of our fiscal year. With regard to the question on sales compensation execution. Listen, we\u2019re pleased with the results and our sales team\u2019s done a real good job. We\u2019re one quarter in, we\u2019ve got to do that a few more quarters in a row, and then we\u2019ll be very confident. So, we feel good about the start. Kris Newton : Thank you very much, Rod. I\u2019ll pass it back to George for some closing remarks. George Kurian : I\u2019m excited by what fiscal year 2018 brings. Customers and industry leaders are also excited by our strategic direction. And increasingly, they are choosing NetApp as their partner for data-driven digital transformation. We delivered a strong start to the year and introduced substantial innovation across our portfolio, and we will introduce even more exciting innovations at our Insight User Conference in Las Vegas in October. We are building on a strong foundation and are with that question the best positioned and the best executing company in the industry. We have technology leadership that\u2019s differentiated and sustainable in several large markets like all-flash rays, converged infrastructure and the hybrid cloud that are in the early innings of their evolution across the enterprise IT landscape. And we have accelerating momentum on the top-line and leveraging our business model that is using solid results on the bottom line. With our scale, talent, technologies and partnerships, we have the unique position to lead the industry and I am even more confident than ever in our future. I want to thank the NetApp team for your laser focus, commitment to transformation and the execution results that we are delivering together. I look forward to talking with you again next quarter.

Eric Martinuzzi - Lake Street Capital Markets LLC Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP Operator : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to NetApp's Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. I would now turn the call over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Thank you for joining us on our Q2 fiscal year 2018 earnings call. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Ron Pasek. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com, along with the earnings release, our financial tables and guidance, a historical supplemental data table, and the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation. As a reminder, during today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2018 and our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons, including global political macroeconomic and market conditions and our ability to expand our total available market, enhance our product offerings, execute new business models, manage our gross profit margins, capitalize on our market position, maintain execution, and continue our capital allocation strategy. Please also refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, specifically our most recent Form 10-K for fiscal year 2017 and our current reports on Form 8-K, all of which can be found on our website. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP, unless otherwise indicated. I'll now turn the call over to George. George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.: Thank you, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. I am very pleased to report another strong quarter with revenue above the midpoint of our guidance range and gross margin, operating margin, and earnings per share all above our guidance. We saw a solid demand environment in all geographies and strong customer interest in our industry-leading solutions. I am proud of our continued progress in transforming NetApp to deliver sustained profitable growth. Our strong performance reflects our customers' commitment to NetApp and their clear and growing preference for the value of our Data Fabric strategy. We are undoubtedly out executing our competition on all fronts. In the second quarter, we launched innovative new products and grew our business in new areas. It's been particularly exciting to see our cloud strategy pay off with our expanded relationship with Microsoft Azure and the industry's first Azure enterprise NFS service. In the new era of IT, driven by digital transformation and defined by the ubiquitous hybrid clouds, IoT and machine learning, NetApp is uniquely positioned as the leader in helping organizations liberate and unleash their data for maximum business impact. We enable customers to meet the exponential data growth of the digital era where they must manage a complex hybrid world with data in the data center, the cloud and in edge computing, and externally linked applications and platforms. Unlike competitors' approaches, which are siloed and do not embrace the cloud, we help organizations unify their data across the widest range of cloud and on-premises environments to realize its full value for competitive advantage. Data is at the heart of company's digital transformation, and we are winning because we are enabling customers' success through data. No one matches our expertise in data management, our leadership in growing market segments and our open ecosystem approach. Our advantage is the result of decades of software-based innovation, strategic focus and the ability to partner effectively. Before giving you an update on the set of strategic solutions that are tightly aligned to customers' IT imperatives, I want to give a brief update on the dynamics in our mature solutions. Consistent with our plan, the headwinds for mature solutions continue to lessen. In the second quarter, product revenue from mature solutions declined 3% year-over-year. The transition from 7-mode to Clustered ONTAP is behind us. Our add-on hardware business is growing, and we have a renewed focus on hardware and software OEM opportunities. In the coming quarters, the headwinds for mature solutions could abate and could possibly provide some support for additional top line growth. As a part of our transformation, we have aligned tightly to our customers' IT imperatives as they harness the power of cloud, build next-generation data centers and modernize their existing storage infrastructure. This has resulted in a differentiated strategic solutions portfolio focused on the growth areas of the market. And we continue to bring innovative solutions to more customers in more ways. As I noted last quarter, we have already transitioned our business away from the declining segments to the data-driven high-growth segments of all-flash arrays, converged and hyper-converged infrastructure and hybrid cloud. The success of our strategic direction is evident in the continued momentum in our strategic solutions, which were 69% of net product revenue in Q2, up 23% year-over-year. Customers are moving to all-flash arrays as they modernize existing data centers and build next-generation data centers to lower total cost of ownership while gaining greater speed and responsiveness from key business applications. This shift creates enormous new opportunity for us as we penetrate our installed base and displace competitors' equipment with our cloud-integrated all-flash solution. We continue to substantially outpace the growth of the all-flash array market and competitors, both large and small. In Q2, our all-flash array business, inclusive of All-Flash FAS, EF and SolidFire products and services, grew about 60% year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run rate of $1.7 billion. Our strength in flash is also driving our success in SAN and converged infrastructure markets. Our clustered storage solutions have substantial and structural technological advantages over competitors' SAN products. This is enabling us to gain share in the SAN market, both in new customer acquisitions and in greater share of wallet within existing customers as we displace legacy competitive SAN installations. The all-flash FlexPod again helped to strengthen our number two position in the converged infrastructure market and contributed to the 20% year-over-year growth of FlexPod revenue reported in IDC's Quarterly Converged Systems Tracker for calendar Q2 2017. We continue to outpace and win against full stack vendors with our best-of-breed solution. In Q2, we delivered new innovations that further strengthened our leadership position in the all-flash array market. The latest version of ONTAP offers 40% increased performance over earlier versions, helps companies increase capacity savings by 30% and offers stronger security and new compliance capabilities. This expands upon the performance leadership of the world-record SPEC SFS performance benchmark that we set earlier in the quarter. The new EF570 all-flash array designed specifically for performance-intensive workloads such as big data analytics, technical computing and video surveillance, leads both the SPC-1 and SPC-2 benchmarks for price performance and is the first enterprise all-flash array to support NVMe over InfiniBand for ultra-low-latency applications. The newest SolidFire Element OS helps customers align business goals to IT service levels with new user-defined quality of service policies to further simplify performance management in rapidly evolving private clouds. NetApp's SnapMirror integration supports data movement from Element OS systems to ONTAP systems across the Data Fabric. These SolidFire innovations are incorporated in NetApp HCI, the first enterprise-scale hyper-converged infrastructure solution which began shipping at the end of Q2. We enable customers to overcome the limitations of inflexible first-generation HCI products that strand resources, throttle the performance acquired by next-generation applications and are not able to consolidate workloads. Customers are excited that we are delivering on all of the promises of HCI and we are seeing strong demand for this offering. More and more customers, partners and service providers are choosing NetApp because of our hybrid cloud strategy. Our recent industry-first announcement with Microsoft Azure is clear evidence of the strength of this strategy. This enterprise NFS service in the cloud will be delivered natively in Azure and powered by NetApp. Users will access this service directly through the Azure console and continue to get the scale, performance and reliability offered by NetApp's leading data services. NetApp is unique in its approach to collaborating with the hyperscalers and has defined the best-in-class model for helping our joint customers deploy hybrid cloud. We have partnerships with all the leading hyperscalers, which enable us to deliver NetApp enterprise value through their massive cloud infrastructures. These relationships allow us to monetize customers' use of the cloud and increase our opportunity to expand our market share in the on-premises market. I could not be more excited about the possibilities created by this part of our business. We are building on a solid foundation that is generating profitable growth today and positions us for continued growth in the future. We remain focused on three priorities. We are aligning to the high-growth areas of the market and reaching more customers in more ways. We are continuing our disciplined approach to realign our resources against the biggest opportunities and to focus on productivity to expand our innovation. And we are maintaining our focus on capital allocation, balancing shareholder returns with investment in the business for long-term growth. Our second quarter results are a strong indicator that the transformation of NetApp remains on track and is accelerating our success with customers. It's clear that our strong execution and Data Fabric strategy are enabling us to build deeper and more strategic relationships with companies around the world. At our recent Insight User Conference, thousands of customers and partners shared their excitement for our strategic direction and long-term vision. We expect our improved momentum to continue throughout the year. We are the data authority for the hybrid cloud, planning for the future, leveraging our technologies and scale to create new businesses, expanding our total available market and creating shareholder value. Before turning it over to Ron, I'd like to thank the NetApp team for your focus, commitment to transformation and the exceptional results that we are delivering together. Ron? Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.: Thanks, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers today. Now let's get started. NetApp again delivered strong operating results across the P&L, underscoring robust customer demand for a broad portfolio of innovations. Our sharp focus, market-leading innovation and disciplined execution are clearly yielding positive results. Q2 net revenues of $1.42 billion grew more than 6% year-over-year, including 1 point of tailwind from currency, and we're above the midpoint of our guidance range. Product revenue of $807 million increased 14% year-over-year. Q2 marks the fourth consecutive quarter of year-over-year product revenue growth, demonstrating our successful pivot to the growth areas in the market. The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenues of $615 million declined 2% year-over-year and increased 2% sequentially. As expected, the year-over-year headwind in services revenue decreased in the second quarter. Although we generally don't provide services revenue guidance, as I said on our last call, we continue to expect the year-over-year headwind from services revenue to lessen and ultimately return to growth early next fiscal year. We are confident in these expectations given our strong product revenue growth and the progress we are making in service renewal execution. Gross margin of 64.3% was well above our guidance range. Product gross margin of 51.8% increased 3.6 points year-over-year, reflecting the benefit from improved sales discipline, some onetime items and currency. Software maintenance gross margin was relatively flat year-over-year, while hardware maintenance and other services gross margin increased about 2 points year-over-year. Operating expense of $642 million increased 1% year-over-year and 1% sequentially due primarily to higher variable compensation and currency. As a percentage of net revenue, operating expenses of 45% represented over 2 points of improvement year-over-year, reflecting improved leverage from our ongoing transformation efforts. Operating margin of 19.1% increased almost 4 points year-over-year and was above our guidance range due to higher revenue and better than expected gross margin. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.4% and weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 275 million. EPS again exceeded guidance. At $0.81, it was $0.09 above the high end of our guidance range due to higher revenue and improved gross margins. We closed Q2 with $6 billion in cash and short-term investments with 16% held by our domestic entities. This increase in domestic cash was temporary, reflecting the additional $800 million of bonds we issued in late September in order to retire the bonds we had coming due in December. After Q2 quarter-end, on November 3, we retired early the $750 million in bonds. In Q2, we repurchased $150 million of our shares and paid approximately $54 million in cash dividends. Since 2013, we've returned over $6.5 billion to shareholders through our share repurchase and dividend programs. Today, we also announced our next cash dividend of $0.20 per share, which will be paid on January 24, 2018. To reiterate, we are committed to completing by the end of May 2018 the remaining $494 million of the share repurchase program that we announced in February 2015. Deferred and financed unearned services revenue was down 1% year-over-year showing improvement from Q1 fiscal 2018. Our cash conversion cycle of negative 10 days improved 19 days year-over-year, reflecting a 21-day increase in days payable outstanding, partially offset by a two-day increase in days inventory outstanding. DSO at 37 days was flat year-over-year. As I said in the past, we continue to exercise our deep business and technical partnerships with our SSD suppliers. We have enough on hand and committed supply of SSDs to meet our requirements well into next fiscal year. Q2 cash flow from operations was $314 million, an increase of 99% year-over-year. We generated strong free cash flow of $285 million in the quarter, which represents 20% of net revenues and is an increase of 179% year-over-year. Now the guidance. For Q3, we expect net revenues to range between $1.425 billion and $1.575 billion which, at the midpoint, implies a 6.8% increase year-over-year. We expect Q3 consolidated gross margins of approximately 62.5% to 63.5%, reflecting a higher mix of product revenue quarter-to-quarter. We expect operating margins of approximately 20%. And finally, we expect earnings per share for the third quarter to range between $0.86 and $0.94 per share. Looking at the second half of fiscal 2018, we remain confident in the guidance we provided on our prior call. To reiterate, we expect our typical seasonal patterns with revenue dollars increasing each quarter. Though we overachieved in Q2, we continue to expect our year-over-year growth rate to accelerate in the second half of the year. We expect gross margin to be at the high end or slightly above the 62% to 63% range we've previously communicated and operating margin to be at the high end of the 18% to 20% range that we guided. Further, we remain committed to delivering low-double-digit EPS growth for the year and free cash flow in the range of 19% to 21% of revenue. As I outlined during our Analyst Day in April, we are planning the long-term business for low-single-digit revenue growth in order to keep our operating expenses in line. However, as we articulated, there are many reasons we could and should outperform our long-term revenue plan. Based on our first half results and Q3 guidance, we expect mid-single-digit revenue growth this year with the upside flowing straight through to operating margin. In closing, we are proud of our Q2 results. We delivered over 6% year-over-year revenue growth yielding a 35% increase in year-over-year EPS, clearly demonstrating the leverage in our business model. With our sharp focus, market-leading innovation and disciplined execution, we continue to drive sustained results. With that, I'll hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris? Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: We'll now open the call for Q&A. Please be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to one question so we can get to as many people as possible. Thank you for your cooperation. Operator? Operator : Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Steve Milunovich of UBS. Your line is open. Steven Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Good afternoon. 14% product growth, obviously, is very impressive. I know there's a number of factors that go into that, George. But you comment on the fact that you were able to implement a new sales plan this year which you weren't able to do last year and to what degree your go-to-market changes, including sales and marketing, are impacting your growth rate? George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.: I think we're very, very pleased with the performance of our sales team. We saw exceptional execution across all of the different geographies and all of the different segments of the business. And we are extraordinarily \u2013 see very, very good momentum. We have a differentiated product portfolio. We have strength in all of our different channels of distribution. Our Data Fabric strategy is resonating with customers and the sharp focus of our field organization gives us extraordinary confidence in the business looking forward. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Erik Suppiger of JMP Securities. Your line is open. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Yes, thank you. Could you give us some metrics around the HCI platform, what kind of growth and maybe adoption rate you're seeing? George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.: We introduced the hyper-converged platform in October just this past month. We are excited at the demand that we've seen for the product. It has exceeded our expectations. We also booked some orders and we're focused on converting the rest of our pipeline this quarter. So we've got really good momentum. It's too early to break it out. And we see a lot of customer interest. We have a differentiated offering, delivering on the promise that hyper-converged gave customers with an enterprise-grade solution. Erik L. Suppiger - JMP Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Thank you, Erik. Next question? Operator : The next question comes from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Aaron Christopher Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities : Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to dive a little bit deeper into the continued growth that you've seen in the flash business, which has been very impressive. George, you've talked a lot about your ability to kind of gain incremental wallet share and customers. So I think it would be helpful to understand, as you look back over the past few quarters, how much of your momentum in all-flash is coming out of your existing installed base versus, let's say, net new customer or wallet share wins, and how maybe that's changed over the last few quarters. Thank you. George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.: We continue to see very, very good momentum displacing competition to gain wallet share. One of our competitive programs has seen continued increases in the number of competitive displacements per day. This quarter, we saw more than two competitive displacements per day, which is up substantially from the numbers we reported the last quarter. The majority of our flash footprint is net new wallet share in customers at the expense of legacy frame SAN arrays from our competitors like HP, IBM and EMC. We still see substantial room to run. We are still in the early innings of flash adoption in our customer base. We have an extraordinarily differentiated flash portfolio, as I mentioned in my comments. We have several world-record performance benchmarks, a deeply differentiated software portfolio, and we continue to see strong momentum going forward. Aaron Christopher Rakers - Wells Fargo Securities : Thank you. Congratulations. George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.: Thank you. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Thank you, Aaron. Next question? Operator : Next question comes from Simon Leopold of Raymond James. Your line is open. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thank you very much for taking the question. I understand it is early in the HCI market. But, as you have said, you've got a differentiated approach. So, how should we think about your expectations in terms of how to weave the HCI contribution in over, let's say, fiscal 2019 or calendar 2018? I want to take a longer-term perspective on how to place it into the overall business. Thank you. George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.: We're not providing guidance for fiscal 2019. As Ron mentioned in his prepared remarks, we are raising the guidance for the second half of the year. So, as we see continued acceleration in the business and, for the full year, as we said, we would guide to mid-single digits, up from low-single digits. I won't break out the hyper-converged. I'll just say it's part of that up-leveling of the number. And we feel very good about the offering we have in the market and the momentum we're seeing. Simon M. Leopold - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thank you. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Thanks, Simon. Next question? Operator : The next question comes from Mark Moskowitz of Barclays. Your line is open. Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. Trying to keep it to one question here; I want to get a sense if you can help us out because we're probably expecting some investors to say this is as good as it gets. And obviously, your tone and tenor and guidance suggest otherwise. George, how should we think about the enterprise NFS opportunity? Is that something that could be additive to the business model in calendar 2018? Or is that more of a 2019 phenomenon? George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.: That's a 2019 phenomenon. The enterprise Azure NFS service, we are very, very excited at the prospects to expand our reach to new customers in more ways and partnering with one of the world's leading hyperscale cloud service provider. It's in private preview next month and will be generally available for customer adoption next fiscal year. So, this year, we're not counting that in the materiality of our business. We will give you more color in our next Analyst Day in spring. But I do think it will be an additional growth driver for the company. I think the way I look at it we are riding several long-term secular trends : data growth and the criticality of data in a digital business; major technological transitions like solid-state storage, converged infrastructure and the cloud. We have a differentiated strategy for customers, the Data Fabric strategy, which is very, very difficult for people to replicate. As you know, we've been working on this for five years. We also have a vastly differentiated innovation portfolio with many years of differentiated software innovation that positions us to build the Data Fabric and deliver it in compelling products. And our execution has been really strong. So we feel we have a lot of headroom to continue to take the business, and we are going to double down on it. And we see strong momentum heading into the second half of the year. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Thanks, Mark. Next question? Operator : The next question comes from Tim Long of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you. Could you talk a little bit about \u2013 you mentioned having adequate flash supply. Can you talk a little bit about what it's meant to the pricing of your products and the impacts on revenues and gross margins and how you see that evolving over the next year as the commodity comes more into supply/demand parity? Thank you. Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.: Yeah. We do have adequate supply for both SSDs and DRAM, by the way. Definitely more of a headwind on the DRAM pricing, that's definitely something everyone's suffering from right now, but moderated increases on SSDs. I think what we're seeing now is it's widely anticipated sometime in the first half of the next calendar year, we should see supply free up. That slipped a little bit from what we thought before. It looked like beginning of next year it will start to free up, but now it's delayed a little bit. So, at this point, it hasn't really affected either our gross margins or our revenue, and I don't anticipate that it will in the future. As we said in the past, typically, what we've done when we've gotten commodity price increases is pass them on to customers, those increases. And by the same token, when we see those commodities decrease, we pass along the price decrease as well. Timothy Patrick Long - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Thank you. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Thank you, Tim. Next question? Operator : The next question comes from Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your line is open. Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC : Thanks. Good afternoon. Ron, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the operating leverage to the gross profit line. By my numbers, it looks like you've pulled tremendous conversion margins down on the upside from sales. Can you just talk a little bit more detail what caused that? And then you did reference that that could continue to occur. What would be the forward-looking statement and why you get continued gross margin, conversion margins like you've been seeing? Thanks. Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.: So, different than last year where we typically were under-spending on OpEx throughout the year. What we're seeing this year is we're overachieving on gross margin. I mentioned that was a focus area of the company. It's an area we've had a lot of effort and work put into. We were particularly focused on product margins and have made pretty good progress, I think we have a ways to go, so that's where that continued leverage would come from. As well, I think what you're seeing is we're holding OpEx largely in line with what we told you. For the year, the only increase we had at beginning of the year was merit increases for employees. At this point, we have a little bit of headwind on OpEx just from FX and variable compensation. But essentially, you have gross margin growing at a higher rate than revenue on a dollar basis, and you have OpEx being held below both of those growth rates. So that's where you're getting the operating leverage. Steven Fox - Cross Research LLC : Great. Thank you. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Thanks, Steve. Next question? Operator : Next question comes from Brian White of Drexel. Your line is open. Brian J. White - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Hi, George, I'm wondering if you could talk about what you saw in the federal market in the quarter and also the enterprise market at large. Cisco just had a call, enterprise product revenues are down 5% year-over-year. They highlighted delays at big customers. So maybe if you could tease that out for us. Thanks. George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.: We saw good momentum in the public sector market. The book of business, as you know, we have a broad-based book of business because we are the unquestioned market leader in the public sector market. It reflects the spending priorities of the administration. So, defense and intelligence were strong, reflecting the budget allocations that they received. But we were \u2013 overall, we feel confident that we gained share. We saw the normal year-end budget flush across all of the different segments in public sector. Our enterprise book of business was also very good. It was very strong across all of the geographies. We saw strength in \u2013 particular strength in the Americas and in Asia Pacific, but good balanced book of business across the board. Brian J. White - Drexel Hamilton LLC : Great. Thank you. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Thank you, Brian. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Suva of Citi. Your line is open. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thank you. It's Jim Suva from Citi. I have a question and it has to do with \u2013 you'd mentioned ability to secure memory pricing, NAND and DRAM, I'm sure you're talking about, are secure memory. Were you talking about the availability to get it or have you locked down pricing? My understanding is it's probably being locked down supply and then as the fluctuations in price changes, you probably adjust that in your product portfolio, but maybe I'm wrong with that. And then you mentioned something about a onetime gross margin benefit, like, what was that? Was it memory related and how much of it and how should we think about that going forward? Thank you. Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.: Yeah, Jim. So it is in relation to locking down supply. We do start to agree on price as we get closer to the quarter, but not that far out. It's anything \u2013 six months out, we're not agreeing on price. It's just supply. And then we just had some manufacturing variances in the quarter. Some were related to memory, but there were other purchase price variances we saw. That's it. You can't count on those necessarily reoccurring. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: But can you quantify those variances for this quarter? Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.: On a total gross margin basis, it was roughly about a 0.5 point. Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you and congratulations to you and your team on their execution. Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.: Thanks. Thank you. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Thank you, Jim. Next question? Operator : The next question comes from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Congrats on the quarter. Follow-up as it relates to gross margins. There were some pretty meaningful swings in the balance sheet, inventory down sequentially eight or nine days. And as you mentioned, days payable were up significantly year-on-year, which helped the cash conversion cycle. Just wondering if that relates to some of the actions you've taken to fight the memory pricing and if that had any benefit on gross margins that you see as sustainable? Or what else drove those swings on the balance sheet? Thanks. Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.: Okay. So, Katy, I think what I tried to intimate last quarter is inventory was a little bit high. Some of that was due to SSDs. We knew we worked that down, we're doing that. We're back to the levels we were roughly on inventory days and turns where we were roughly eight year ago. So that's more like where we should be. I don't think you can equate any of that to gross margin directly, and so I think they're quite disparate. The DPO is something we worked on and have been working on, actively part of the transformation efforts around working capital management. So, you should see that going forward to continue. The goal is to be roughly zero cash conversion cycle. Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Thanks, Katy. Next question? Operator : The next question comes from Srini Nandury of Summit Gladstone (sic) [Summit Redstone]. Your line is open. Srini Nandury - Summit Redstone Partners LLC : All right. Thank you for taking my question. George, at the Supercomputing Conference I'm currently attending, the rage seems to be all about NVMe over Fabrics. It looks like SAN is coming back and people we talk to note that network storage is coming back given that HCI is still being used in limited use cases and storage efficiency is not being realized. Can you comment about the return of SAN, please? Thank you. George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.: Yes. We have got NVMe over Fabrics deployed in our EF-Series, EF570 Series product. We have NVMe over InfiniBand in that product for ultra-low-latency use cases especially in financial trading applications or in real-time analysis or fraud detection types of applications. We have NVMe support in our FAS series of products, where the NVMe is used as a low-latency cash. And we see that this is exactly the trend that enables people to get the benefits of shared storage, efficiency, single point of management, consolidation of footprint while getting the benefits of low latency and host connectivity. And so we do see that over time, as NVMe becomes more mature, it will become a big enabler. It will be a good enabler to network storage like you mentioned. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Thank you, Srini. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Kelleher of D. A. Davidson. Your line is open. Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wonder, you talked about hyper-converged. I want to talk about converged products. FlexPod, you said, was up very strong, up 20% year-over-year. Your partnership with Cisco has always been strong. A couple of weeks ago, you announced a new product, NetApp plus Fujitsu plus Extreme Networks. How do you position that converged product against FlexPod and how do you see our partnership with Cisco evolving? Thanks. George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.: Cisco continues to be a really strong partner of NetApp. Our strength in flash combined with the capabilities of the UCS and intent-based networking from Cisco is driving meaningful growth in the FlexPod business. As you noticed, 20% in the converged infrastructure business is substantially ahead of any other full stack vendor in the market. And so we are gaining share from competitors of both of our companies. Fujitsu and NetApp have had a long-standing relationship of more than 20 years of joint engineering, as well as we have gone to market together in many parts of Europe together. The NFLEX solution with a simple converged infrastructure solution that combines compute from Fujitsu with storage from NetApp and is targeted at the EMEA market. It is for customers who are looking for a simple preconfigured factory-built solution, which is different than what we have with FlexPod, which is much more flexible and customizable. And it's targeting places where Fujitsu has built customer relationships and loyalty. So it expands our reach and it provides us with another opportunity to compete more broadly in parts of the world that we didn't address as successfully before. Mark Kelleher - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Great. Thanks. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Thank you, Mark. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Thanks. I guess, if I just look at the Jan quarter guide on revenues, it suggests at least at the midpoint the revenue growth should accelerate to almost 7% on a year-over-year basis. I'm wondering if you could maybe just unpack that and talk about, if I think about 7% growth in Jan, how much of that is FX driven versus organic for you guys. And from an organic basis, I think you mentioned HCI, but I'm curious what else is driving that acceleration in organic growth for you? George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.: First of all, I think the 7% number is correct. As we mentioned before, we see, in the normal seasonality of the business, the revenue growth rate to accelerate through the second half of the year, and this is consistent despite the fact that we've had a strong first half and it reflects our continued momentum. It reflects the broad book of business that we're seeing, reflective of the mature solutions just posted a 23% year-on-year growth, growth; the strategic solutions just posted 23% year-on-year growth. We continue to see that broad portfolio continuing to see accelerate. Mature is almost flat now year-on-year, just down 3%, so the headwind for mature is going to decline. We continue to see gains in SAN and we have hyper-converged. So we feel very good about our portfolio and our execution in the marketplace. With regard to FX, I'll have Ron comment on that. Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.: Amit, FX is actually a little bit of a headwind going into next quarter, a little less than 1 point, so it's not helping at all. Amit Daryanani - RBC Capital Markets LLC : Perfect. Thanks and congrats on the quarter, guys. George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.: Thank you. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Thanks, Amit. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi of Maxim Group. Your line is open. Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC : Thank you. And my congrats on a great quarter and great guidance as well. Relative to the midpoint of your guidance, I believe that implied that product revenue would be up about 8% year-over-year, whereas it was up 14% year-over-year. And it sounds like the driver of that outperformance was strategic driven. So, within strategic, how much of that do you think you believe we can attribute to the complete portfolio of hybrid cloud data management software capabilities that, at least in my opinion, NetApp is pretty uniquely presenting to end customers? And okay, I'll just leave it at that for now. George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.: I think, first of all, the 7% number was aggregate revenue, not product revenue. We're not going to break out the guide of product versus services. But the 7% number that you impute is aggregate revenue. So we see continued acceleration of our business through the second half of this year. With regard to our portfolio of innovation, we are winning both on-premises deployments as well as net new customer logos because of our Data Fabric strategy. I think that is aligned with customers' spending priorities and it is the best investment protection argument that any vendor in the marketplace can offer customers, which is, you can start with us on the cloud and move your data on premises. You can start with us on premises and take your data with you seamlessly to wherever you want to go. So, the overall value proposition that we've spent years developing is clearly resonating as customers deploy the hybrid cloud. In addition, our individual solutions that underpin the Data Fabric are also very strong. We've got a compelling offering for SAN. The converged infrastructure portfolio is really strong and expanding with both Fujitsu and the hyper-converged. And our portfolio of hybrid cloud solutions continues to expand with the hyperscalers. So we feel very good about our position in the market and we're going to double down on it. Nehal Sushil Chokshi - Maxim Group LLC : Okay. Thank you. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Thank you, Nehal. Next question? Operator : Next question comes from Andrew Nowinski of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co.: All right. Thanks and congrats on a nice quarter. Just had a follow-up question on your product gross margin; it continues to expand. It was up another 190 basis points this quarter. Do you feel like you can still get that into the mid-50s where it's been historically? And then how should we think about product gross margin going forward as it relates to your Q3 and annual guidance? Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.: So, Andy, great question. I was \u2013 we talked about this at Analyst Day. This year that's not the target we're aiming for. When we have our Analyst Day next year we'll give guide \u2013 that very well could be part of the discussion. But, at this point, I'm not seeing that this year. Andrew James Nowinski - Piper Jaffray & Co.: Got it. Thanks. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Thanks, Andy. Next question? Operator : Next question comes from Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.: What's that? Operator : Your line is open. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, thank you. Just following up on the product gross margin; can you maybe comment on the competitive pricing environment? It seems like the competitive pricing environment is more moderate than it's been historically. Maybe some detail on what you're seeing. Thanks. George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.: It's always competitive, Sherri. I think every transaction is competitive. I think we have a differentiated software portfolio and a long-term strategy, as well as I do want to congratulate our field organization on sales discipline that allows us to apply pricing discipline selectively where we need it, right? But every transaction remains competitive. We have a portfolio of both all-flash and hybrid flash solutions, and one of the things we have noticed is that some customers are choosing hybrid flash since the price increases in solid-state. And so our unique approach where we have a single software architecture that can span both gives us a differentiated competitive position as well. And so we've been using that to be disciplined in the marketplace. Sherri A. Scribner - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Thank you, Sherri. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi of Lake Street. Your line is open. Eric Martinuzzi - Lake Street Capital Markets LLC : A question \u2013 I didn't see it anywhere. I know you retired \u2013 you spent $150 million on the repurchase in the quarter. What's the current share count? Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.: The diluted share count for the quarter was 275 million. Eric Martinuzzi - Lake Street Capital Markets LLC : Right. But the \u2013 so you retired what, like 3 million or so? I'm just looking for a kind of \u2013 what's the right share count to use for Q3? Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.: I don't typically guide that but \u2013 hold on a second. Yeah, we bought back about 3.5 million shares in the quarter. Eric Martinuzzi - Lake Street Capital Markets LLC : Okay. Thanks. Ronald J. Pasek - NetApp, Inc.: Sure. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Thanks, Eric. Next question? Operator : Next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of SIG. Your line is open. Mehdi Hosseini - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP : Yes, thanks for taking my question. I want to go back to a couple of quarters ago when we were talking about the installed base and opportunities associated with it. I think you have characterized the installed base as offering you opportunity in the range of $12 billion to $15 billion and all-flash array currently accounts \u2013 or the upgrade is only limited to less than 10%. And in that context, my question is where are we in upgrading the installed base? And how should we think about contribution of HSI (47:11) in that upgrade, should we assume a much accelerated upgrade, or is this something to be determined? George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.: First of all, thanks for your question. The percentage of our installed base that is on solid-state is just about 10% now. And so we have a long base of footprint to go upgrade. And as you know, with our Clustered operating system, the process to upgrade our installed base to solid-state is pretty seamless. You can move from disk to flash in a seamless mechanism. And so we have a good opportunity ahead of us as flash continues to become more and more affordable relative to disk. With regard to hyper-converged, I think that that's an opportunity for net new customer acquisition, net new workload capture and primarily at the expense of direct-attached storage or alternate storage solution from our competitors, and so we do see hyper-converged being additive to our installed base. We are seeing that today in the use cases for hyper-converged as opposed to converged system like FlexPod, they are different. So we think that that's adding an upside (48:34). We'll tell you more as we get more into the hyper-converged market. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: Right. Thank you, Mehdi. Next question? Operator : Yes, we have a follow-up question from the line of Steven Milunovich of UBS. Your line is open. Mr. Milunovich, please make sure your line isn't muted, lift your speaker phone, lift your handset. Kris Newton - NetApp, Inc.: All right. Well, it sounds like we don't have Steve. I'm going to pass it back to George for some closing remarks and then we'll let everyone go a little early. George Kurian - NetApp, Inc.: Thank you everyone, and thank you, Kris. The transformation of NetApp to deliver sustained profitable growth is on track and yielding positive results. Our Data Fabric strategy is clearly resonating with customers. We are out executing and out innovating the competition as we help companies harness the power of the cloud, build next-generation data centers and modernize their existing infrastructure. In the second quarter, we introduced a number of industry-leading innovations that position us for continued growth and expand upon our leadership position. I am more confident than ever in our future and look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

Welcome to NetApp's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. I would now turn the call over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Kris Newton : Thank you for joining us on our Q3 fiscal year 2018 earnings call. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Ron Pasek. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com, along with the earnings release, our financial tables and guidance, a historical supplemental data table, and the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation. As a reminder, during today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2018 and our expectations regarding the repatriation of cash, future revenue, profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons, including global political macroeconomic and market conditions and our ability to expand our total available market, enhance our product offerings, execute new business models, manage our gross profit margins, capitalize on our market position, maintain execution, and continue our capital allocation strategy. Please also refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, specifically our most recent Form 10-K for fiscal year 2017 and our current reports on Form 8-K, all of which can be found on our website. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP, unless otherwise indicated. I'll now turn the call over to George. George Kurian : Thank you, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. In the third fiscal quarter, NetApp delivered strong results, with all key financial metrics in line with or above our guidance. We again saw a solid demand environment and customer momentum, landing wins and footprint expansions with leading organizations in all geographies. Before discussing our continued progress, I want to thank the NetApp team and all of our partners for their high level of execution and commitment to delivering against our goals. I also want to let you know that we will hold a Financial Analyst Day in New York City on April 5, where we will share more detail on the evolution of NetApp as the data authority for the hybrid cloud. Now I will discuss the results of the quarter. It is rewarding to see the success of our improved execution as we transform NetApp to deliver sustained and profitable growth. Our momentum is fueled by our alignment with customer's interest in leveraging data for business impact and by their preference for our scale, innovation and strategic focus. In the third quarter, we expanded our cloud infrastructure and cloud data services offerings, most notably introducing NetApp Cloud Volumes for Amazon Web Services and support for VMware on AWS. With our Data Fabric strategy and industry leading solutions, we are creating new customer and business opportunities. Organizations that are undergoing digital transformation, leveraging the Internet of Things and technologies, like analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence to radically improve their business performance. Data is the heart of these digital transformations. NetApp is uniquely positioned as the leader in helping organizations liberate their data for maximum business impact. In the data-driven digital era, customers require solutions for a complex world, where data resides in the data center, in multiple clouds, at the enterprise edge and in externally linked applications and platforms. Our competitors are struggling to adapt to this new era of IT, and lacking a deeply cloud-integrated strategy will continue to fall behind. With the NetApp Data Fabric, we help customers simplify and integrate data management across multiple clouds, data centers and Edge to accelerate digital transformation and address their top IT imperatives, modernizing storage through data management, building next-generation data centers and harnessing the power of the hybrid cloud. Our focus enables us to accelerate growth by prioritizing investments and execution against the biggest opportunities. This success of our strategic direction is evident in the continued momentum in our strategic solutions, which was 70% of net product revenue in Q3, up 26% year-over-year. As we indicated on our last call, headwinds from mature solutions have abated. In Q3, mature solutions contributed 30% of net product revenue, flat year-over-year. The shift to flash creates enormous new opportunity for us as we consolidate and displace competitor's legacy equipment, gain share in new workload deployments and upgrade our install base. Our cloud-integrated all-flash solutions help customers modernize their IT environment and consolidate second and third platform workloads to meet the growing demands of performance and data intensive applications, like analytics, machine learning and artificial intelligence. In Q3, our all-flash array business, inclusive of All Flash FAS, EF and SolidFire products and services, grew almost 50% year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run rate of $2 billion. Our strength in flash is also driving our success in the SAN and converged infrastructure markets. With our highly successful competitive takeout program, we, again, averaged two predominantly SAN competitive displacements per day. This is enabling us to gain share in the SAN market, both in new customer acquisitions and in greater share of wallet within existing customers. As customers build cloud architected data centers to deliver cloud services for next-generation applications in either private or service provider models, they are increasingly turning to the simpler deployment models of converged and hyperconverged infrastructure. Driven by the strength of the all-flash FlexPod, we grew more than 50% year-over-year in the converged infrastructure market and are gaining share for IDC's quarterly converged system tracker for calendar Q3 2017. With the recent announcement of NFLEX converged infrastructure with Fujitsu, we expect further share gains by expanding our reach to the customers with whom Fujitsu has built relationships and loyalty. Momentum with NetApp HCI, which we began, shipping at the end of Q2, is progressing to plan. Our initial focus on expanding share of wallet with existing customers by addressing new workloads and buyers is working. At a global automotive company, we won a seven figure HCI deal, supporting a three-site VMware server virtualization environment. We won against the leading first generation HCI player because of the strength of our solution, data fabric integration and track record for customer success. We continue to see strong demand for this offering, driven by customer excitement for our enterprise grade approach, with the ability to flex, storage, and compute separately and to support mixed workloads confidently. More and more, customers and partners want to work with us because of our cloud strategy. Our rich portfolio of cloud data services enables customer's cloud, hybrid cloud and the multi-cloud strategies, the private preview for our industry first announcement with Microsoft Azure for Azure filed by NetApp, is oversubscribed with customers who are strategically focused on leveraging the Azure cloud. Early customer feedback has been very positive due to the simplicity and performance of the solution. As planned, Microsoft is leading the primary engagement with customers, enabling us to reach outside of our base to cloud-only buyers. In Q3, we announced NetApp Cloud Volumes for AWS, currently in private preview. This new service available in the Amazon marketplace offers high levels of performance and availability to speed enterprise applications, including analytics, DevOps, backup and disaster recovery. We have also seen a high level of customer interest in this offering and expect both Azure filed by NetApp and NetApp Cloud Volumes for AWS to be in public preview before the end of this fiscal year. Our cloud data services allow us to monetize customer's use of the cloud and increase our opportunity to expand our market share in on-premises deployments. As I said last quarter, I could not be more excited about the possibilities created here. We will have more details about how we see this part of our business unfolding, and if contribution to our business model at our Financial Analyst Day. We are building on a solid foundation that's generating profitable growth today and positions us for continued growth in the future. As we move through the second phase of our transformation, we remain focused on three priorities. First, aligning to the high-growth areas of the market and reaching more customers in more ways. The size and growth of our strategic product revenue attest to our success here. Second, continuing our disciplined approach to realign our resources against the biggest opportunities and to focus on productivity while expanding our innovation. As we pivot towards new markets and engage new customers, we continue to realign resources and prioritize investments to stay focused and ensure we are well positioned for the future. And third, maintaining our focus on capital allocation, balancing shareholder returns with investment in the business for long-term growth. We'll gain added flexibility from Tax Reform and we'll have more on this topic at our Financial Analyst Day. Our strong Q3 performance reflects our customers and channel partners confidence in NetApp and their clear and growing preference for the value of our Data Fabric strategy. We are building deeper and more strategic relationships with companies around the world. Our expertise in data management, leadership in growing market segment and open ecosystem approach is unmatched. We have a fundamental strategic advantage, created by decades of customer understanding, software-based innovation, focus and the ability to partner effectively, and we continue to out-execute the competition on all fronts. As you see in our guidance, we expect our momentum to continue in Q4. As the data authority for the hybrid cloud, we are planning for the future, expanding our total available market and creating shareholder value by leveraging our technologies and scale to create new businesses and customer relationships. I will now turn the call over to Ron. Ronald Pasek : Thanks, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers, unless otherwise noted. Our Q3 results speak to our successful pivot to the growth areas of the market, supported by our industry-leading innovation and execution. I'm proud of our team's hard work and sharp focus, delivering consistently against our commitments. Net revenues of $1.52 billion grew 8% year-over-year, driven by strong product revenue and a two-point currency tailwind. Product revenue of $920 million increased more than 17% year-over-year, reflecting the strength of our strategic products, as well as a 3.5 point currency benefit. This is the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year product revenue growth. The combination of software maintenance and hardware maintenance and other services revenue of $603 million declined about 3% year-over-year and 2% sequentially due to lower revenue from renewals. However, we saw healthy growth in deferred and financed unearned services revenue, which increased 1% year-over-year and 3% sequentially. The maintenance attached rates to new product sales remains consistent and we saw healthy growth in our installed base. Gross margin was 62.6%, product gross margin of 50.2% increased 4.5 points year-over-year, reflecting the benefit from reduced promotions, some onetime items and currency. Both of software maintenance, gross margin and hardware maintenance and other services gross margin were relatively flat year-over-year. Operating expenses of $644 million were flat sequentially and increased 11% year-over-year. The year-over-year increase was due almost entirely to higher variable compensation expense, associated with our over-performance and to a lesser extent, merit and currency. Excluding these items, OpEx would have been flat year-over-year, reflecting our continued strong discipline. As a percentage of net revenue, operating expense of 42% were roughly flat compared to the same period last year. Operating margin of 20.4% was flat year-over-year as well. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 276 million. EPS was $0.99. We benefited from a lower tax rate and higher other income from onetime currency gains on balance sheet items, excluding these items, EPS would have been $0.92. Now I'll briefly discuss the implications of the new U.S. Tax Reform Act on FY '18. We have lowered our full year effective tax rate to 18%, reflecting 4 months of benefit of the new tax rate. As a result, we made a year-to-date true-up, yielding a Q3 effective tax rate of 15.7%. In addition, we recorded a discrete GAAP tax expense of about $860 million due to the new U.S. Tax Reform Act, which includes the transition tax related to the deemed repatriation of our foreign earnings. This charge resulted in a GAAP net loss of $506 million. We closed Q3 with $5.6 billion in cash and short-term investments. To reiterate what I said on our last earnings call, the domestic cash balance at the end of Q2 was temporarily higher due to the additional $800 million of bonds that we issued in late September to retire the bonds we have coming due in December. In Q3, on November 3, we early retired the $750 million in bonds, resulting in the decrease of onshore cash. Finally, as a result of tax reform, we plan to repatriate over $4 billion of foreign cash over the next 12 months. We remain committed to the same capital return philosophy that I outlined during last year's Analyst Day, and will provide-specific capital allocation plans during this year's Analyst Day in April. Our cash conversion cycle of negative 11 days improved 28 days year-over-year, reflecting a 30-day increase in days payable outstanding and a six day decrease in days inventory outstanding, partially offset by a six day increase in DSO due to some timing issues. We had another outstanding quarter of cash generation, with cash flow from operations of $420 million, an increase of 79% year-over-year. We generated strong free cash flow of $388 million in the quarter, which represented 25% of net revenues and is an increase of 104% year-over-year. In Q3, we repurchased $150 million of our shares and paid approximately $53 million in cash dividends. Today, we also announced our next cash dividend of $0.20 per share, which will be paid on April 25, 2018. We remain committed to completing, by the end of May 2018, the remaining $344 million of the share repurchase program that we announced in February 2015. Now onto guidance. For Q4, we expect net revenues to range between $1.525 billion and $1.675 billion, which at the midpoint, implies an 8% increase year-over-year, including a 2 point currency benefit. We expect Q4 consolidated gross margins of approximately 61.5% to 62.5%, reflecting a higher mix of product revenue sequentially. We expect operating margins to range between 20% and 21%. While we don't explicitly guide OpEx, the implied Q4 year-over-year increase is driven by currency, variable compensation, merit and a small severance charge. And finally, we expect earnings per share for the fourth quarter to range between $0.95 to $1.03 per share. Now let's step back and look at our implied FY '18 results. Based on our Q3 year-to-date results and the mid-point of our Q4 guidance range, you can see tremendous leverage in our business model. On a year-over-year basis, our projected 6% revenue growth and 8% gross margin growth yield an 18% increase in operating income and a 25% increase in EPS. We are well positioned to deliver on our commitments, and expect continued progress in Q4. I look forward to seeing you in April at our Financial Analyst Day. With that, I'll hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris? Kris Newton : We'll now open the call for Q&A. Please be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to one question so we can get to as many people as possible. Thanks for your cooperation. Operator? Operator : Thank you, ma'am. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Your question please. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you. Ron, your product revenue showed some strong quarter-on-quarter growth, but product gross margins came in 160 basis points weaker. I know last quarter you had a 50 basis point purchase price variance. Can you bridge the moving pieces here, is this more discounting, is it competitor response, is it just the mix in the quarter, or did the ATI ramp have anything to do with that? Thank you. Ronald Pasek : Sure. Wamsi, I mentioned when I guided last quarter, that we did have some one-time benefits in Q2. Those didn't recur obviously in Q3. And we did have a little bit of higher discounting, which we normally see seasonally in Q3. That's really it. Wamsi Mohan : And do you expect that to persist on ongoing basis? Looks like your guides relatively flat on gross margins? And how should we think about that trajectory, given some of the commentary around the software contribution of ONTAP Cloud and potentially the increasing mix of that over time? Ronald Pasek : Yeah. I'm only going to talk about Q4, but it's implied in the total margin guide and you're right, that we're roughly flat for product margins quarter-to-quarter implied in that total margin guide. I think you've got to go out and you have to wait until Analyst Day to have us give implications for some of the monetization of our Cloud business. So I'm not going to talk about that - this early. Wamsi Mohan : Thanks, Ron. Kris Newton : Thank you, Wamsi. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jayson Noland of Baird. Your line is open. Jayson Noland : Okay, super. I wanted to ask on hardware maintenance. That was down a little again on a fairly easy comp. Any more color you can add there? And then just generally, how should we model that going forward? George Kurian : Yeah. So we were down a little bit, but as I said, we saw an increase in deferred revenue, which is a precursor to see that part of the business return to growth. And I have said this year, as we went through the year, the headwind would lessen. That's still what we would like to see. And going out to next year, we're going to give you a little more color at Analyst Day about what you should model next year. But as I said, remember, the installed base is growing, increasing significant product revenue growth, and that's starting to accumulate in the installed base for both point-of-sale and ultimately renewals. Jayson Noland : Okay. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, Jayson. Next question? Operator Next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski of Piper Jaffray. Your question please. Andrew Nowinski : Great. Thanks for taking the question, and great quarter. So I wanted to ask about your U.S. commercial revenue. It was up, it looks like about 8.5% year-over-year, which is the highest it's been since FY '12, and your strategic revenue growth also accelerated this quarter off a pretty difficult comp. So can you just give us any color as to what's driving the strong demand specifically in that region, in the commercial segment, as well as you know, were there any new product like HCI - helped that growth rate in the quarter? George Kurian : The strategic product revenue growth continues to reflect both our alignment with customer's spending priorities and the fact that we are gaining share in all of the fast growing markets at the expense of competition. So we feel very good about our progress. I think with regard to hyper-converged as we mentioned, we are very excited about the momentum. We're off to a strong start. Customer demand is reflecting the position and value of our solution, and we are focused on gaining share in that market as well. Andrew Nowinski : Great. Thanks. Kris Newton : Thanks, Andy. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Your question please. Aaron Rakers : Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I can appreciate that you're having an Analyst Day in early April, but I'm just curious, how you guys think about your capital allocation. You're bringing $4 billion of cash back onshore. In the past, you've talked about driving to as much as a 3% dividend. So I'm just curious - can you give us any qualitative or even quantitative color on how you think we should think about capital allocation? Or may be taken another way, of how much cash you really believe the business requires to run optimally? Ronald Pasek : Yeah. So I'll just reiterate what I said almost a year ago, which is - we do want to increase the dividend significantly. That's likely to be something we announced in Analyst Day. As you know, we nearly done with our current share authorization repurchase. Undoubtedly, we'll probably announce another significant share repurchase. And what I also talked about was de-levering and that's probably something we'll do a little bit of. We still want some debt in our capital structure. And just to reiterating what we said, this doesn't change how we think about in organic growth. So just having cash onshore doesn't change our idea of what makes sense from an inorganic standpoint. Aaron Rakers : Okay. Thank you very much. Kris Newton : Thanks, Aaron. Next question. Operator : The next question comes from Joe Wittine of Longbow Research. Your question please. Joe Wittine : Hey, guys. Nice quarter. While your results, obviously, indicate you're taking share from the legacy competition, I guess we got to ask again because you're largest competitor is again doubling down on investing and storage resources. So curious on your take there, George and specifically, whether you see any risk that competition could intensify to the point of impacting gross margin? Thanks. George Kurian : I think the competition has always been fierce. I think that our largest competitor's remains a formidable one. They have fundamental product portfolio challenges and the lack of cloud story. So it's not just a matter of hiring people or throwing incentives at the channel like they've been that's going to turn around their business. They've got to fundamentally rationalize a completely confusing product portfolio. They lack a competitive flash offering with a road map to the future, and they've got to get a cloud story. So lots of work to do on their side. They'd rather be in my shoes than in theirs. In response to refuse to lose, we'll just say, we refuse to stop quitting. Kris Newton : Thanks, Joe. How about the next question? Operator : The next question comes from the line of Sherri Scribner of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Sherri Scribner : Hi. Thank you. I was hoping you could provide a little more detail on the competitive environment specifically for the hyper-converged product? I know you mentioned that the product is doing well. But curious how you're stacking up against Nutanix and SimpliVity? And then just generally the competitive environment you mentioned it's competitive. But we've heard some things about AMC not doing well, would be helpful to get some additional color? Thanks. George Kurian : The hyper-converged market, I think, will have different use cases over a period of time. We are focused on the enterprise use cases of hyper-converged, where customers want to deploy an infrastructure for enterprise applications, which have guaranteed performance, scalability and predictability and our architecture is resonating for those use cases. We are positioned to scale, compute and storage separately from each other. We use industry standard, networking interfaces and all of those have led us to be off to a very good start. We have more work to do to expand the range of customers. But the points of differentiation that we have articulated prior to the product launch are proving out in the transactions that we're competing for. Kris Newton : All right. Thanks, Sherri. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Kurtz of KeyBanc Capital. Your line is open. Alex Kurtz : Yes. Thanks for taking the question, guys. Ron, just on discounting comment earlier in the Q&A. And I think the expectation in the market that memory and NAND costs are going to see some improvement this year. What's your view on those dynamics playing out in product margins over the next couple of quarters? Ronald Pasek : We've talked about this, you know, as you saw last year when NAND prices rose, we chose to raise all this price. And in most cases, try to pass that on to our customers. By the same token, should we see significant decreases in NAND prices, we would probably do as well price decreases. However, remember, DRAM is getting quite expensive, so we balanced it with that. Absent timing issues, you really don't see an impact because of NAND memory. We really kind of make it neutral. George Kurian : I think if you see decreases in NAND pricing, I think from a product mix shift, we'll be testing customers deploy more all-flash arrays. I think given the substantial differentiation that we have in that segment, it allows us to capture new footprints and competitive - accelerate competitive placements even faster than we are today. So we are excited of the prospect of NAND pricing coming back in line through this latter part of the summer. Alex Kurtz : Thanks. Kris Newton : Thanks, Alex. Next question Operator : Next question comes from Rod Hall of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Rod Hall : Hi, guys. Thanks for the questions. Sorry, I just want to quickly come back to the discounting point. You said it was seasonal. Could you just articulate why that seasonality tends to be the case? May be just kind of give us a little bit of background? And then I also wanted to ask, we know there's a lot of potential demand from AI workloads for FAS, and wonder if you can comment on what you're actually seeing in the market? Are you seeing traction on those kind of workloads today in your numbers? Do you expect to see a lot of growth from that area over the next, let's say, 12 months or so? Thanks. Ronald Pasek : So it's seasonal in the sense that last quarter is the large, US public sector quarter. We typically see little higher margin elevation in there, and it received a little bit in Q3. That's really all we see- and we saw and we actually forecasted that. That was baked into the guide I gave. George Kurian : With regard to artificial intelligence and machine learning, one of the fundamental underpinnings of an AI environment is having a large amount of data that you can use to train the algorithms that are being developed for machine learning. And with our technology, we are seeing customers start to build out those environments either on-premises alongside GPU stacks from people like NVIDIA or on the cloud as part of our cloud services portfolio. And so we feel well positioned to capture those deployments as they come, because we are the only vendor that can do that either on-prem or on the cloud, and we're excited at that possibility. Rod Hall : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Rod. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Amit Daryanani : Thanks for taking my question, guys. I guess, maybe just to clarify, Ron. When you talked about the 18% tax rate, was that a fiscal '18 statement? Or does that apply to fiscal '19 as well is a right way model it, so I just wanted to clarify that. And I guess, just from a question perspective, George, you talked about partnerships with hyperscale customers like Microsoft and Azure and Amazon AWS. I think it's fairly unique that you guys to do this versus your peers at least. So can you maybe talk about what sort of revenue or TAM opportunity do you see over here? And in these instances the customers do end up using your products, what are they displacing or what are you offsetting at that point? Ronald Pasek : So to the first part of your question. Yeah, the 18% was for FY '18 only. We'll give you more information on what likely is to transpire with our future tax rate at our Analyst Day. George Kurian : With regard to the question on the cloud data services, yes, we are clearly differentiated in the market because we are the only technology provider that can give the customer the choice of where to deploy their technology, either in their data center, in a co-location provide facility on their edge or in the cloud. With regard to the work we're doing, we are very excited. These solutions are in private preview, meaning, pre-commercial. It will be available later this year in the commercial form. And so for Q4, we see acceleration of our momentum without any contribution from these cloud data services. We will tell you that we could not be more excited about the possibilities that these afford in terms of overall customer success and contribution to our business model, but we'll share more of those details at Financial Analyst Day. With regard to what are they displacing, there are sort of two or three categories of choices that customers make. For new workloads that are being deployed on the cloud, where they need scale and efficiency, they are typically displacing a service that hyperscaler offers. So for example, EFS from Amazon, customer will choose our storage services and data services because they're just much mature and much more high performance and scale better. With regard to the use of the cloud, the second use might be to displace an on-premise environment and those could be from either a competitor of ours or from us, as they decide to move workloads. And the third is to have a hybrid deployment, either across clouds or between a public cloud and the on-premises world, where we are increasingly winning on-premises market share at the expense of competitors who cannot offer a cloud offering. So all of those of three, and we really feel like this will be a meaningful contribution to our business, particularly for our customers. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, Amit. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. Your line is open. Ananda Baruah : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on a really solid quarter and on increasing momentum. I guess, George, this could be for George or Ron, or George and Ron. Just with regard to the April guide, it seems like - and I'm backing into this. But it seems like the strategic product revenue seasonality or guidance - sequential guidance for April is a little bit softer than what that was for the last two Aprils where you did kind of 15%, 16% growth. And given your tailwinds, I wouldn't have expected that. So the question is, is there anything going on in an environment that would cause April seasonality for strategic to be a little softer than the last two years? George Kurian : I don't think you should see that. I think when we look at the April quarter, we continue to see strength in our product business. I think the overall product revenue should continue to stay in the range of year-on-year growth that you see in the current quarter. I think the mix between mature and strategic depends on the quarter. I think in the mature certain categories in mature are tied to the performance of our OEM business, which can vary quarter-to-quarter. So I don't think you should - we don't see any slowdown in our strategic momentum whatsoever. Ananda Baruah : Thanks, George. That's really helpful. Appreciate it. George Kurian : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, Ananda. Next question? Operator : The next question comes from Jim Suva of Citigroup. Your line is open. Jim Suva : Thanks very much. I have a clarification question then the main question. The clarification question is I think I've heard you say you'll talk about stock buyback, dividend, capital funds at your Investor Day. If that's true, I guess the question is why is this something unique or complicated and needs more time to iron it all out while other companies' reports have already given such guidance? And the question I have is on the deferred revenues. Can you talk a little bit about kind of what's going on there as far as any impact of it to the cash flow statement as we see those changes in the flow through the cash flow? Thank you. George Kurian : We always planned to articulate the capital return at Analyst Day. It coincides with the disclosures and meetings we have internally. But again, we gave you a guidance on that subject 10 months ago, and we're going to be consistent with that guidance. So you're right, anytime we increase deferred revenue that usually means we get cash up front. So, that - all things being equal, that would help cash flow, which it did last quarter a little bit as deferred increased to 1% year-over-year. So that's right, that's exactly how we think about it. But we made more progress in other aspects of cash generation, mostly you can see them demonstrated in the cash conversion cycle, where we elongated DSO. We had a really good turns there for days of inventory. We're quite low, and a little bit worse than DSO, but it's a focus here for the company, and we've been negative in the cash conversion for the past two quarters. Jim Suva : Thank you so much for the details and clarification, Kris Newton : Thank you, Jim. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Moskowitz of Barclays. Your line is open. Mark Moskowitz : Yes, thanks. Good afternoon. Kind of continue with that thread about the hump of the analyst meeting. I guess, the guidance seems a little conservative versus what investors it appears were expecting for the April quarter. Is there any sort of dimension here you want to kind of unpacked in terms of how much of that is conservatism versus how the channel respond to the Dell EMC or just waiting until April 5th when you guys unpack each more of the cloud opportunity? Just play kind of hide and seek here. George Kurian : So I think if you look at consensus, we actually guided the top line above consensus before the call. I'll probably spot on EPS, so I don't know view it as conservative at all. And then second question was? Kris Newton : All right. I think Mark, the second part of your question was - is part of the reason why we're waiting to see the impact of Dell EMC? Ronald Pasek : No. no it's just - we've been consisted with the guidance we've given all year. We've met or been in the range or beat them at every quarter. And we don't consistently try to be conservative. We're trying to be realistic. And we try to deliver consistent results and that's exactly what we've been doing. George Kurian : We don't feel any concern from the Dell EMC move. As we said, I think they have always been a formidable competitor, but they have a lot of fundamental issues unrelated to scale and distribution. They have fundamental product issues and alignment with customer road maps that take a long time to fix. So I don't think that we're, in any way, concerned about EMC. We're going to continue to watch them, but we're not worried about the sentiment that they are creating. We feel good about our position, very good. Kris Newton : All right. Well, thanks, Mark. Next question. Operator : Next question comes from Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your line is open. Steven Fox : Thanks. Good afternoon. Just I had a question on the OpEx line. So obviously, we're going to wait until the meeting for specifics on that. But as you mentioned, excluding some comp issues and currencies, you're pretty flat on that, and you're still reworking how OpEx is sort of allocated between growth and mature areas. So can you give us a sense of - obviously, not going into to the numbers. Just sort of how far long you are on that journey and what kind of opportunities you need still to be pursuing over the next 12 months? Thanks. Ronald Pasek : So I think at the highest level, what we said last year at Analyst Day is that for FY '19 and '20, we plan to self-fund our merit increase where you saw a bump up this year in FY '18. There's a little bit of headwind next year as it relates to FX. But that's still the commitment that we're driving to get the leverage out of the business model. Steven Fox : And so there are still ongoing shift going on within the business and over the next year prospect is similar to what we saw so far? Ronald Pasek : Yeah. We - exactly, we've been really clear that transformation is not an event. It's something we're doing ongoing. You can see that this quarter we had a small separate charger that's part evidence of that transformation. We continue to make changes of that you don't see in our total results, but internally, there's lots of trade-offs, lots of investment and disinvestment and we'll continue to do that and will for probably forever. Steven Fox : Great. Thanks for the color. Kris Newton : All right. Thanks, Steven. Next question. Operator : Next question comes from Steve Milunovich of UBS. Your line is open. Steve Milunovich : Great. Thank you. George, could you talk a bit about the go-to market this year? I think this is the first fiscal year that unable to implement the changes that Andrea is been able to implement the changes that he wanted to make. What are those changes in sales and marketing? And are you seeing the effect? George Kurian : I think we've been very pleased with the breadth and the performance of the theaters and geographies, as we mentioned in my prepared remarks. We're seeing strengths across segments, geographies and there's really good momentum of our strategic product portfolio. So we want to thank our sales leadership and our sales teams for that. I think we continue to focus in on where - how to align our resources against the biggest opportunities. As we rollout new innovations with cloud providers and hyper-converged to make sure that we've got our best resources aligned against the biggest customer segments and opportunities, that's a work that we'll continue, as Ron said, through next year. But overall, we're very excited at the momentum. 26% year-on-year growth in strategic products is a really good benchmark. And for mature to reach stabilization, gives us a lot of confidence looking forward. And we're really excited to finish the year and a step into the next year. Steve Milunovich : In the past, I think you have said that you're under penetrated to some degree in the largest accounts. Are you seeing some success there? George Kurian : Yeah. As the Run to NetApp campaign, which is one of our competitive programs, continues to be very strong. I think the resellers, who sell to the enterprise, also have given us really good feedback on the momentum of our portfolio. And finally, as we bring the cloud service providers into the market with our technology, we will be able to access buying centers and wallets in those accounts that are not available to traditional infrastructure providers. So we feel very, very good. We're well positioned, and we continue to gain share and stay focused on that. Kris Newton : All right. Thanks, Steve. Next question? Operator : The next question comes from Srini Nandury of Summit Insights Group. Your line is open. Srini Nandury : All right. Thank you for taking my question. George, a bigger picture perspective, are virtual storage devices being replaced by HCI devices and more importantly the HCI devices from you or from your competitors is going to the new workloads or going to existing workloads? Thank you. George Kurian : There's a certainly an element of HCI workloads that are replacing SAN environments. An HCI environment is a way to displace a more traditional cyber channel environment with an Ethernet-based simplified storage landscape. The HCI environments today are being deployed. Traditionally Gen 1 HCI was for a standalone VDI, Virtual Desktop Infrastructure use case. There was not as much for mixed workloads. But as we bring enterprise-grade HCI into the market, people are deploying multi-use workloads on top of HCI. So we feel that it's a new set opportunities for us to go capture and that we're very pleased with the start that we've had. We've got more work to do, but we're off to a really good start. Srini Nandury : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Srini. Next question? Operator : Next question comes from Mark Kelleher of D.A. Davidson. Your line is open. Mark Kelleher : Great. Thank you for taking the questions. I was wondering, as your cloud data services ramps, can you tell us what the impacts you expect on the maintenance lines or software and the hardware lines as we go forward? Is there anything changed in how that attach rates, right? And then if I could slip a quick clarification into, Ron, the receivable spike, you mentioned some timing issues. Could you just say what those were? Thanks. Ronald Pasek : Yeah. Let's start with your last question first. So, I think, what we had last quarter was fairly linear shipments, but we had certain customers that were early payers that occurred earlier in the quarter than usual. So that left a little bit of a timing issue. It's not something - we don't have an escalation and elongation in receivables. So it's particularly well into caught up list related to what customers decided to pay. George Kurian : With regard to the maintenance lines, it depends on the agreement that we have with the specific cloud provider. In the case of our partnership with Microsoft, Microsoft does the level one and level two support, and NetApp does the level three support. The solution starts out with the hardware, but should quickly transition to a software-only model. So it will be a very attractive business to us. In the case of the solution, for example, with Amazon, we deploy the infrastructure of software, sell it through the Amazon marketplace and we get some maintenance revenue stream. We have not seen any difference in the maintenance attach rates between our cloud services and on-premises technology, I think, so far. So we feel good about the business. We'll tell you more as it becomes - as we head into Analyst Day. Mark Kelleher : Great. Thanks. Kris Newton : Thanks, Mark. Next question? Operator : Next question comes from Lou Miscioscia of Pivotal Research Group. Your line is open. Lou Miscioscia : Okay. Thanks, George. One of the insights, a couple of years ago, you talked about going on a limb or maybe you talk about your daughter actually anticipating that. So when we look forward, I think that the street numbers are pretty modest for growth, especially product growth, going out to fiscal 2018. And a couple of quarters ago, you did talk about double-digits and obviously, you now delivered that. As we look forward, given that you've talked so well about your product positioning and obviously your competition having problems, I think you can get a double-digit product growth next year? George Kurian : Listen, I think we'll tell you more about our outlook heading into next year. I think if you look at what we had told you for fiscal 2018, we had said that we were planning the business for low single-digit, but we had a lot of confidence to believe that we could outperform that number and we have been, right? So this is a fifth consecutive quarter of product revenue growth year-on-year, and the numbers are very strong. I think that what you'll see from us is the ability to continue to stay disciplined on the operating expense line, while delivering strong top line performance. And we'll give you more details of that for what it means from fiscal 2019 onwards on Analyst Day. But I'll just tell you that our confidence in our ability to drive product revenue growth to help accelerate the top line of the company is even stronger today than a few quarters ago. Mature has started to stabilize, as we said, and the strength of our strategic product portfolio, both in terms of the markets we compete in as well as the new markets that we are stepping into, is evident. And I'll just leave it there, so thanks. We're excited. Lou Miscioscia : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Lou. Next question? Operator : Next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of Susquehanna. Your line is open. David Ryzhik : Hi. Thanks very much for taking the question. This is David Ryzhik for Mehdi Hosseini. So it took you guys six quarters to get to a $1 billion run rate in all-flash. What do you think you can get to in six quarters in HCI? And going back to all-flash, just wondering, any metrics you can share around E-series, whether that grew - outgrew your overall all-flash? And specifically, if you can touch on the EF570 the NVMe over fabric? Thanks so much. George Kurian : So let me take on each of those. The NVMe over fabric technology, that's available in the E-series EF570. For NVMe over InfiniBand, we started to see some really good customer applications for it, targeting extremely high-performance analytics workloads for real-time analytics platforms, either in cloud service providers or in large-scale enterprise customers. So we're - we feel good about that offering. I think the E-series broadly, the branded business did well. The OEM business depends on the quarter and the performance of the OEMs, as we've said, consistently. I think with regard to the overall product portfolio that we talked about, again, we feel very good about the mix of business. I think with regard to the adoption of HCI, it's a little different than flash where are flash is essentially replacing one operational environment with another. In the case of HCI, there are some environments where the decision-making body for buying a hyper-converged infrastructure is different from the one that buy standard storage, right. So it may take a little bit longer to ramp, but the market is growing very quickly, so we'll have to wait and see. There's a lot of opportunity. We've got a good solution and we're going to compete like hell. David Ryzhik : Thanks so much George. Kris Newton : Thank you, David. Next question. Operator : Next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi of Lake Street. Your line is open. Eric Martinuzzi : Yeah. The question is with the deal sizes, which is really more a reflection of maybe customer confidence. I'm wondering if you're seeing just because we've got so many different levers going on here, you're signing of new customers, you got installed base, but are you seeing deal sizes creep up? George Kurian : I think in the solid state business, given the track record and the capability that we have, we continue to see bigger and bigger footprints coming our way at customers, where they are now displacing entire landscapes and standardizing on our flash technology as the platform. I think in other cases, where it's still early like in the cloud, for example, we are in private preview, so we haven't yet started charged commercially. But you see people doing proofs of concepts and getting ready for commercial availability. Eric Martinuzzi : And that's true both U.S.A. and international? George Kurian : Correct. Eric Martinuzzi : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Eric. Next question. Operator : Next question comes from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Good afternoon. Just a couple of quick questions. Ron, some of your partners talked about strong demand or budget flash at the end of the quarter and as a result, the tight component environment caused them to miss some business, which given that dynamic. Wonder if you saw either of those dynamics? And then secondly, George, curious what you're hearing from your customers around Tax Reform, the impact of higher earnings flow-through and more cash onshore accelerated depreciation? Are your customers thinking that they can accelerate some of their IT spend and strategic projects around hybrid, Edge, AI, et cetera? Thank you. Ronald Pasek : So Katy, as the first part of your question, we do not have a problem with components, particularly NAND or DRAM. We have already accessed checked out in my prepared remarks because it's really become a non-issue at this point. And you can see our performance for the last six quarters has been consistent in that respect. George Kurian : With regard to the question you had about the impact of tax reform, I think we see that the improving economic outlook and consumer confidence is allowing customers to plan longer term. And so we are seeing people getting more definitive about what they want to do. I also think that they are getting much clearer about what they want to do in the cloud and what they want to do consequently on-premises. So those are the two clearer driving factors we see. And in certain cases like deployment of flash technology, there's a really hard return on investment that they can capture very quickly and those are all driving momentum in customer transactions. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Katy. Next question. Operator : Next question comes from Edward Parker of BTIG. Your line is open. Edward Parker : Yes. Thank you. So, I guess, just following up on Katy's question, I just wanted to get your take on the broader demand environment. Are you specifically seeing more spending on on-premise infrastructure and renewed investments? I know you've talked a lot about getting a lot of share and displacing customers, but you think you're getting an extra lift just an overall improving demand environment, probably for 2017 and then into 2018? Interested in your thoughts. Thanks. George Kurian : I mean, I think, we operate in a broad range of geographies, so I'd be hesitant to give you an answer on one thing. I think the overall IT landscape that we see reflects the geographic economic outlook, right? So in a country, where things are looking bullish, people are spending more. In countries where the economic landscape isn't as strong, people are not spending as much. I think that's the general pattern we see. I think with regard to the U.S., I think clearly, the economic outlook is a little better. That's giving people more confidence and you're seeing that. I think with regards to our own product portfolio, we are overweight relative to everybody else in our industry of scale in the places where customers are spending. So we have all-flash, converged, hyperconverged, and cloud as big bets, and they are clearly in the areas where customers are spending. And we have a differentiated portfolio in each of those segments. So we get to see a lot of transactions that are high priority for customers to spend. I don't think that's the case for other players in the market or broadly speaking, for the portfolio at large. Kris Newton : All right. Thank you, Edward. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Simon Leopold of Raymond James. Your line is open. Simon Leopold : Great. Just wanted to see if we could drill down on - specifically on one of the geographies. EMEA look like it had some pretty decent sequential and I imagine some of that is seasonality. But some of our checks are indicating enterprise spending has improved in that region. Just want to see if maybe you can elaborate a little bit on the trends of that particular market in the quarter in your outlook? Thank you. George Kurian : We had good execution in a number of countries in EMEA. Certainly, Germany, improvements in Southern Europe, and stabilization in the UK. The UK market, I would say, is still trying to figure out the implications of Brexit. There's a lot of contingency planning. And so that does hold up certain large transactions. We're winning our share of the smaller transactions. But I think we were very pleased with the strength of many, many parts of the European segment for us. Simon Leopold : And your thoughts on the coming year? George Kurian : I think it will still broadly reflect economic performance in those geographies. I would hesitate to characterize a single European outlook. I do think we feel good about our position in Germany, both because of the economy and as well as the strength of our local execution. We are by far the market share leader in Germany. I think we continue to see opportunities for further improvement in France and certain parts of Southern Europe. And then in the U.K., we're waiting for further clarity on exactly how whether it's going to be a hard Brexit and how and when, right? So we'll tell you more at Analyst Day as that data gets clearer to us. Today, it'd be premature to comment about the U.K. Simon Leopold : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Kris Newton : Thank you, Simon. Next question? Operator : Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Nehal Chokshi of Maxim Group. Your line is open. Nehal Chokshi : Yes, thanks for taking the question. Excellent quarter in my opinion. For the fiscal second quarter, was there an FX tailwind on product revenue, similar to what you saw for the January quarter? George Kurian : Yeah. There was a little bit of help. I think it was about a one point help last quarter. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. So that's fair to say that on a constant currency basis, product revenue did indeed accelerate? George Kurian : Yes. That's correct. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. Great. And if I may, a follow-up question. What percent of conversations are now being led with hybrid cloud? And what percent of close still some element of hybrid cloud in it? George Kurian : I think it's certainly expanded substantially. I think most of our discussions with customers start with some flavor of cloud, whether it's a public cloud or service provider cloud, there's clearly an element of cloud in virtually every discussion. I think with regard to the transactions themselves, they may start on-premises, but because of our road map to the cloud, right. So we think that these conversations are materially different than a year ago, and we're certainly benefiting from that. Nehal Chokshi : Great. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, Nehal. And I'll pass it back to George now for some closing remarks. George Kurian : Thanks, Kris. Q3 marked another great quarter for NetApp. We are winning in the cloud and on-premises deployments as well as gaining new customers because of our Data Fabric strategy. We are gaining share in the high growth, all-flash array market, the SAN market and the converged infrastructure market. We're gaining momentum in the HCI market, and we are uniquely positioned to monetize the growth of the cloud. We feel very good about our position in the market and we're going to double down on it. Our continued strength drives my confidence in our future. Thank you. And we hope to see you in April at our Financial Analyst Day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

As a reminder, during today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the first quarter and full year fiscal 2019 and our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns, all of which involve risks and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons, including global political, macroeconomic and market conditions and our ability to expand our total available market, introduce and deliver new and differentiated products and services without disruption, manage our gross profit margins, capitalize on our market position in cloud strategy, maintain execution, and continue our capital allocation strategy. Please also refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, specifically our most recent Form 10-K for fiscal year 2017 and our current reports on Form 8-K, all of which can be found on our website. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP, unless otherwise indicated. I'll now turn the call over to George. George Kurian : Thanks Kris and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. The fourth quarter marked a great finish to a strong year with all key financial metrics in line with or above our guidance. We again saw a solid demand environment with key customer wins and footprint expansions in all geographies. Our momentum with customers continues to accelerate and we are increasingly viewed as a critical strategic partner for data driven digital transformations. Fiscal year 2018 was an important milestone in NetApp's transformation. We successfully pivoted to the growth areas of the market and improved operational discipline to deliver sustained and profitable growth. Through a focus on execution we grew total revenue by 7% while improving both gross and operating margins from fiscal year 2017. Most notably, product revenue grew 15% and we expanded product gross margins by 350 basis points. Growth in revenue from strategic solutions was strong and revenue from mature solutions stabilized as expected. Our Data Fabric strategy and industry leading solutions enable us to win new customers, expand share within existing customers and create new business opportunities. In fiscal 2018 we lead in all-flash arrays, entered the hyper converged infrastructure market with a differentiated enterprise grade offering and began capturing the shift to cloud with unique industry-leading partnerships. Clear innovation leadership coupled with strong go to market execution has enabled us to gain share in all key product categories and in every geography. Organizations are undergoing data-driven digital transformations to radically improve their business performance. These customers require solutions for a complex world where data resides in the data center, in multiple clouds, at the enterprise edge, and in externally linked applications and platforms. NetApp is uniquely positioned to help organizations derive business value and competitive advantage from their data regardless of its locations. We empower customers to take advantage of capabilities in the cloud across multiple hyperscalers, operate with hyperscaler cloudlike infrastructure and modernize traditional IT with flash and connections to the cloud. The Data Fabric connects customers to all the leading public cloud solutions and provides industry-leading data services across public cloud, private cloud, and the enterprise. Our competitors are struggling to adapt to this new era of hybrid cloud and without any semblance of a cloud strategy or cloud integration, they continue to fall behind. The strength of our strategy is alignment with customer's direction and our consistent execution is evident in the growth of our strategic solutions. In Q4 strategic solutions were 74% of net product revenue up 25% year-over-year. As expected, the headwinds from mature solutions have abated. Mature solutions contributed 26% of net product revenue in Q4 up 4% year-over-year. While we are encouraged by the stabilization in our mature business, we continue to look to our strategic solutions to drive product revenue growth in fiscal 2019. This shift to flash, which is still in its early innings is creating enormous new opportunity for us, as we consolidate and displace competitors' legacy equipment, gain share in new workload deployments, and upgrade our installed base. Our cloud connected all-flash solutions help customers modernize their IT environment and power artificial intelligence and compute in memory intensive applications. In Q4 our all-flash array business inclusive of all-flash FAS, EF and SolidFire products and services, grew 43% year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run rate of $2.4 billion. At the start of fiscal 2019 we expanded our innovation leadership in the all-flash market with the introduction of the AFF 800, the first available end-to-end NVMe platform and the industry's first support of high density 30 TB SSDs. We are helping data-driven customers thrive as they look to deploy new workloads like advanced analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, with the fastest, most cloud connected enterprise all-flash systems. Our strength in flash is also driving our success in SAN and converged infrastructure markets. With our highly successful competitive takeout program we averaged two predominantly SAN displacements per day during fiscal 2018. This success is driving share gains in the SAN market from both new customer acquisitions and wallet share gains at existing customers. As customers look to accelerate their digital transformations they are increasingly turning to the simpler deployment models of converged and hyper converged infrastructure to build cloud. Driven by the strength of the all-flash FlexPod we are gaining share and grew 16% year-over-year in the converged infrastructure market per IDC\u2019s quarterly converged systems tracker for calendar Q4 2017. This represents the fifth consecutive quarter of year-over-year share gain in the converged infrastructure market. Our relationship with Cisco remains strong and we've expanded our reach with our Fujitsu partnership. We began shipping NFLEX converged infrastructure solutions in Q4 and are excited by the opportunity to engage with Fujitsu's loyal customer base. In the HCI market we are winning against first generation players because of the strength of our enterprise grade HCI solutions, data fabric integration and track record for customer success. Customer demand for our HCI offering is driven by our ability to support heterogeneous workloads at scale with guaranteed quality of service and an efficient approach to flexing storage and compute separately reducing over provisioning and license costs. As customers undergo digital transformations, the public cloud offers many advantages, including rich applications, on-demand compute power and infrastructure efficiencies. An increasing number of customers are driving a cloud first IT strategy. Even customers without a cloud first agenda are mindful of future proofing their environments for cloud deployments which strongly benefits NetApp. With our strategic partnerships and cloud integrated data services portfolio, NetApp is uniquely positioned to help customers integrate, optimize, and protect their data on all the leading clouds. We enable our customers to leverage the innovation, time to capability, scale and efficiencies of the cloud while providing consistent data services and integration across hybrid and multi-cloud environments. Our approach to cloud is winning us new customers and driving richer and more strategic customer engagements across all our offering. Only NetApp has partnerships with all the leading hyperscalers and a complete cloud data services strategy for customers. We are grateful for and excited by the opportunity to work with customers in new ways and to have our data fabric be endorsed by the leading hyperscalers as a fundamental part of their data services offerings. NetApp cloud volumes for AWS is now generally available. We on-boarded customers for revenue in Q4 ahead of plan as your NetApp files for Microsoft Azure is in private preview with a growing pipeline of customers and we're off to a strong start in fiscal 2019 with the announcement of NetApp cloud volumes for Google cloud platform. The cloud volume user experience will be integrated into the Google cloud console and is in private preview now. Fiscal 2019 is a foundational year for this part of our business. As it grows we will provide you insight into how it is progressing. Our cloud data services allow us to monetize customers' use of the cloud and increase our opportunity to expand our market share as we help customers modernize their on-premises deployments. The breadth of our partnerships and momentum in the cloud give us an even stronger story for on-premises customers. Additionally, we are able to participate in new opportunities for born in the cloud applications and the uptake of advanced analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning on the hyperscalers the addition of Google to our cloud partnerships is a further endorsement of our cloud leadership and enhances our ability to provide even greater value to customers. The opportunity created by this part of our business is incredibly exciting. In summary, what a difference a year makes. We improved the consistency of our results, expanded our market opportunities, and successfully accelerated our momentum over the course of fiscal 2018. We are undoubtedly in the best position since beginning the transformation of NetApp. Our business is overweight in the growth parts of the market. We have industry-leading partnerships with all the top hyperscalers and we are acquiring new customers and addressing new workloads. We have made great progress and will continue to capitalize on our momentum in fiscal 2019. We laid out a compelling plan at our recent Analyst Day for growth with expanding margins and increased shareholder value. With our strong momentum, I am extremely confident in our ability to successfully deliver this plan. I want to thank the entire NetApp team for their relentless commitment to execution, customer success, and innovation. NetApp employees, partners, and customers all help contribute to a fantastic year. I'll now pass it over to Ron to go through our financial results and expectations moving forward. Ron? Ron Pasek : Thanks George, good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers today unless otherwise noted. As I mentioned at our analyst Day, our team is extremely proud of the progress we've made. Our Q4 and full year results highlight our successful pivot to the growth areas of the market with our industry-leading innovation and execution. As George noted, we are seeing accelerating momentum through the transformation of NetApp, best highlighted by our product revenue growth and gross margin expansion. We expect continued progress in fiscal 2019 and are well positioned to deliver on our commitments to customers and shareholders. Before discussing our full-year results and guidance, I'll provide detail on our performance in the fourth quarter. Net revenues of $1.64 billion exceeded the midpoint of guidance growing 11% year-over-year including a three point currency tailwind. We achieved over $1 billion in product revenue which increased 19% year-over-year reflecting the continued strength of our strategic products, as well as the four and half point currency benefit. This is the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year product revenue growth. The combination of hardware maintenance and other services and software maintenance revenues of $630 million were flat quite year-over-year and increased 4% sequentially, reflecting improved execution on renewals and continued growth in product revenue. The maintenance attach rate to new product sales remains consistent and we continue to see healthy growth in our install base. Gross margin was 63% above the high-end of our guidance range. Product gross margin of 51.5% increased 2.6 points year-over-year reflecting improved sales discipline and some currency benefit. Both hardware maintenance and other services gross margin and software maintenance gross margin were relatively flat year-over-year. Operating expenses of $699 million came in higher than expected. The increase was due almost entirely to higher variable compensation expense associated with our over performance. Excluding variable compensation expense and to a lesser extent currency and salary increases, OpEx would have been flat year-over-year. We remain committed to strong OpEx discipline and with the annual reset of variable compensation expect OpEx dollars to be down year-over-year for the full-year fiscal 2019. Operating margin of 20.4% was within our guided range. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were $273 million down $3 million sequentially, reflecting the completion of our previous $2.5 billion share repurchase commitment. EPS of $1.05 was above the high-end of our guided range and increased 22% year-over-year demonstrating the considerable leverage in our business model. The EPS upside was predominately driven by healthy growth in product revenues and expansion in product gross margins. We closed Q4 with $5.4 billion in cash and short-term investments. Similar to Q3 we saw healthy growth in deferred and finance unearned services revenue which increased 4% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. During the quarter we repurchased $344 million in our shares and reduced our outstanding commercial paper by nearly $250 million. As we discussed at our financial Analyst Day, the Board authorized a new $4 billion share repurchase program. We have also doubled our dividend and remain committed to increasing it further over time. Today we announced our fiscal Q1 cash dividend of $0.40 per share which will be paid on July 25. Our cash conversion cycle of negative 15 days improved 30 days year-over-year reflecting a 34-day increase in days payable outstanding and a seven-day decrease in days inventory outstanding, partially offset by a 11-day increase in DSO. DSO was impacted by a strong finish to Q4. We had another outstanding quarter of cash generation with cash flow from operations of $494 million, an increase of 35% year-over-year. We generated strong free cash flow of $446 million in the quarter which represented 27% of net revenues, an increase of 36% year-over-year. Now turning to our full-year 2018 results. Net revenues of $5.91 billion increased 7% compared to fiscal 2017 aided by a 2-point currency tailwind. Gross margin of 63.4% was up more than a point compared to the previous year and above our guidance range of 62% to 63%. Operating margin of 19% improvement was 2 points versus fiscal 2017 and was within our guidance range. In fiscal 2018 improved execution yielded strong product revenue growth, margin leverage and significant earnings and free cash flow growth. I am pleased to report that we met or exceeded our commitments across all of these metrics. EPS of $3.47 increased 27% from 2017, again demonstrating the operating leverage in our business model and disciplined execution. We generated free cash flow of $1.3 billion in fiscal 2018 which represented 23% of net revenues and is an increase of 64% year-over-year. We continue to deliver on our capital allocation strategy with nearly $800 million in share repurchases and over $200 million in dividends. We returned 76% of free cash flow to shareholders in fiscal 2018. Now on to guidance, as we outlined at our recent Analyst Day in fiscal 2019 we expect revenues to grow mid single-digits with linearity consistent with our normal seasonal patterns. We are forecasting gross margin of approximately 63% and expect operating margin in the range of 20% to 21%. We are committed to delivering EPS growth in excess of 15% and expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 18%. Additionally, we expect to continue to generate meaningful free cash flow in the range of 19% to 21% of revenues. As a reminder, we are transitioning to 606 revenue recognition in Q1 which we expect to be immaterial to our total results. Now on to Q1 guidance, we expect net revenues to range between $1.365 billion and $1.465 billion which at the midpoint implies a 6.8% increase year-over-year including a 1.3 point currency benefit. We expect Q1 consolidated gross margins to be approximate 64%. We expect Q1 operating margin to be approximately 18%. While we don't explicitly guide OpEx the implied Q1 year-over-year increase is driven by currency and merit compensation increases. Note that the Q1 year-over-year OpEx increase will be more than offset throughout the remainder of the year resulting in OpEx being down year-over-year for the full-year fiscal 2019. During Q1 we conducted a workforce realignment of less than 2% of employees as we continue to focus investment dollars toward the best market opportunities and key growth initiatives. We expect earnings per share for the first quarter to range between $0.76 and $0.82. In total, I'm confident about our growth opportunities, especially as it relates to our compelling cloud strategy. Additionally, I'm very pleased with the opportunity we have to continue margin improvement in fiscal 2019 and throughout the long-term plan we communicated at our Analyst Day. With that, I'll hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris? Kris Newton : We'll now open the call for Q&A. Please be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to one question so we can get through as many people as possible. Thank you for your cooperation. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Unidentified Analyst : Hi this is RK [ph] on behalf of Rod. Thanks for taking my question. Are you seeing NAND pricing start to come down and to what extent do you expect that to boost your all-flash array sales? And also for your latest NVMe product, could you talk about how it\u2019s differentiated from the competitor offerings and whether it's intended just for high performance applications or for more mainstream workloads? George Kurian : Let me start by telling you about our NVMe solution. We are the first to ship an end-to-end NVMe solution in the market. We had NVMe solutions that provide investment protected connectivity between the hosts and the storage system over InfiniBand and fiber channel that allows customers to leave in place the network footprints they have already deployed and take advantage of even lower latencies. We also have NVMe connected within the system either as storage devices or as caches and we are differentiated by the fact that we have an end-to-end offering. The fact that our performance from a IOPS perspective is substantially higher, from a throughput perspective it's four times higher than any other competitor in the marketplace and from a latency is industry leading at 200 microseconds and less. So we feel very good about the capabilities that we\u2019ve introduced in the market. With regard to NAND pricing I'm going to let Ron comment. Ron Pasek : Yes, we do see supply getting a little bit better and therefore prices leveling out and starting to go down a little bit. We're anticipating through the [indiscernible] we may see some price decrease, so we want to see those before we taken any actions. Kris Newton : Thanks RK [ph]. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. Andrew Nowinski : Great, thank you very much and congrats on the very nice quarter. You talked about new workloads moving on to the NetApp platforms and one of your competitors is talking about a large direct [indiscernible] storage replacement opportunity in the market which makes sense given the increasing network speeds allowing customers to leverage the benefits of shared storage without incurring a performance penalty. And it looks like, I guess given that you just expand your NVMe portfolio I\u2019d imagine you\u2019re also seeing similar trends, I'd love to hear your thoughts on that opportunity? George Kurian : Clearly the lower the latency in the network fabric, customers can replace direct connected storage devices with shared storage and still get the benefits of high performance. I think the combination of NVMe connected storage as well as advancements in software like with our Plexistor technology will allow us to continue to give customers the benefits of shared storage for an ever increasing range of workloads. In particular the NVMe solutions that we\u2019ve introduced for both InfiniBand and fiber channel allows us to go after the highest performance end of the fan market by redefining a fan landscape and it allows us to gain ever further market share using our flash portfolio, so we feel really good about the overall opportunity. Andrew Nowinski : That\u2019s good. Thanks. And then if you\u2019re allowing a followup I guess just real quick on the gross margin, you clearly outperformed in Q4 and it looks like you expect the momentum to continue to improve in Q1 but your annual guidance suggests that product margin could deteriorate a little bit in the second [and the latter half] [ph] I guess is that just conservatism or is there something more specific that would drive that down from where it's at in Q1? Thanks. Ron Pasek : So remember Andy, the weighting of product revenue to services revenue in Q1 is much, much higher so that weighting makes Q1 a little bit higher throughout than the rest of the year. What you're seeing from Q4 to Q1 is essentially product margins staying where they were in Q4 roughly and the benefit of the higher service revenue and higher service margin. Andrew Nowinski : Very good, keep up the good work guys. George Kurian : You bet. Kris Newton : Thanks Andy. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Katy Huberty : Thank you. I want to followup on gross margins. Ron, you mentioned sales discipline improved and that was a factor in better product gross margins in the April quarter, but I also think you benefit from less OEM mix and the volume increase. So can you just break down the factors that were in play as it relates to April margins? And then you mentioned product mix is the boost in July. Is there anything else driving you to the higher margins in July? Thanks. Ron Pasek : So, if I look at the bridge from Q3 to Q4, for product margins, most of the improvement was better sales discipline. We had a little bit of [indiscernible] FX. You also remember that we actually did quite well in the quarter. We outperformed particularly on the product revenue side and that wasn't at the expense of discounting, so we held our discounts constant and over performed revenue. The other part of your question is on Q1 with respect to just product margins specifically or I'm not going to guide it per se, but\u2026 Katy Huberty : Yes, I mean how would you expect the product margins to trend in the July quarter? Ron Pasek : We don\u2019t guide it, but you can assume based on the guide in total, that it\u2019s roughly flat. Katy Huberty : Okay. Thank you. George Kurian : We continue to see opportunities to expand product gross margin. I think we\u2019ve had really good progress through the course of this past fiscal year. You'll see us continue to press on those levers and other levers going forward. I think the differentiation of our software is strong. The material addition of the cloud business to the portfolio further differentiates our offerings and as we head into this fiscal year we feel really positioned well to extract the full value of that differentiation. Kris Newton : Thanks Katy. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Joe Wittine with Longbow Research. Joe Wittine : Hi, congrats on another great quarter. I want to ask on competition first, it's being reported that Dell may rationalize its storage portfolio, so George I'm wondering how you see this playing out. Perhaps comment on how much of your competitive advantage over call it the last five or six quarters or so may have been driven by an overly complex portfolio at the key competitor to the extent you can? George Kurian : Listen, I think our strategic portfolio\u2019s progress speaks for itself. It has been north of 20% in terms of year-over-year growth for seven out of the last eight quarters. So we feel very, very good about the differentiation of our portfolio and its expanded differentiation through the work that we've done with the hyperscalers. I think what Dell has to do in terms of not only rationalizing their portfolio, but then to develop a coherent cloud strategy is years of work, and so not only does it yield as they rationalize yields for us to take our platform as they transition and give us expanded opportunity, but they\u2019re years behind of on everything from flash to cloud. So we feel really good, we're heading into this new fiscal year with by far the best momentum and the most unique position in the market that we\u2019ve had in as long as I\u2019ve been at NetApp which is quite a while. Joe Wittine : And Ron, quickly could you just address the right way to model your interest in other line here in a rising rate environment? Thank you. Ron Pasek : Yes, so we had, you saw the benefit this quarter we have most of our \u2013 except for the reduced amount of commercial paper in essentially fixed bonds. But we have our cash in short term variable rate, so we actually would as we have more cash in that, we will continue to have net interest income. That\u2019s how you should think about it. Kris Newton : All right, thank you. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst : Yes, thanks for taking my questions. The question is for both George and Ron. I'm looking at your quarterly product revenue and you've done a great job of accelerating the year-over-year growth throughout the year and looking into fiscal year \u201919 I want to get a better feel for how you see these performance execution? If I were to look at your FY\u201919 revenue guide it implies that there is a deceleration. I was under assumption that with cloud HCI revenue kicking in, it would help sustain the growth and compliment the acceleration of some of the more mature products, but I don\u2019t see that implied in the guide. So I'm sorry for a long question, you could turn into multi parts, but back to your guide, how should we think about product revenue on a year-over-year growth and if there's a deceleration would new revenue streams help offset that?. Ron Pasek : So [indiscernible] what I try to imply with the Q1 guide which is about 6.8% year-over-year growth is there is about 1.3 point currency tailwind helping that, which puts it back to about 5.5%, which is in line with what we indicated at Analyst Day. We have that benefit initially in the fiscal year for FX, but as you go through the years I mean great stay where they are that equalizes, so it looks like a deceleration but absent FX it's really not. We don't guide product revenue so we really can't talk through the year, but you know what's different this year about last year is we are coming out as I say no growth here into \u201916, into \u201917 and accelerated growth through the year, you're going to see more of a normalized growth consistent through the year, so a little different than what we're coming out of last year. George Kurian : May be where we are in the fiscal year, we are early in the fiscal year. We have as we have done in the past planned the business conservatively from an operating expense standpoint. As we develop more visibility through the year we will share that in terms of updating you all. Over the last couple of years what we have established as a pattern of operating the company is that if we outperform in the top line as we have done, those outperformance typically flows through the bottom line in terms of increased returns to shareholders. And so you\u2019ve seen us take that philosophy, we are very bullish on the strength of our product portfolio. Having the strategic products which is the place that we are focused on for growth, grow at 25% last quarter year-on-year and to have north of 20% for seven straight quarters, seven out of eight quarters, just shows the strength of the portfolio, so we'll tell you more as the year plays out. Our philosophy is to build a plan that we can meet or beat and provide you more updates as we see more visibility through the course of the year. Kris Newton : Thanks. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Lou Miscioscia with Pivotal Research Group. Lou Miscioscia : Okay, great. So what you can share because I know you're not really guiding to product line, but obviously strategically has done very well what we expect the same type of growth and as we obviously looking at mature which is now stabilized would you even expect maybe low single digit growth there or more likely flat, just trying to understand that if possible? George Kurian : So as we\u2019ve said in prepared remarks we continued to focus on the strategic portfolio to drive growth. We are pleased that the results and they represent the strength of the portfolio. As we head into the second half of this year, you will see the additions of the cloud data services business come into play as well as an expanded set of capabilities in hyper converts. So we feel good about the prospects for the strategic portfolio product and we'll tell you more as the year pans out. With regard to mature, we have as expected seen the stabilization of the mature products. The mature products as we said before, depend on 7-Mode which is our legacy technology, the OEM business and add-on storage. 7-Mode is essentially no longer being sold and so you should expect that to be zero going forward. The OEM business and add-on storage are lumpy on a quarterly basis, but over the course of the year should be no longer a headwind at least to the business; whether it yields growth is dependent on the opportunities we capture. I think that we feel good about modeling it as at least flat for this coming year. Lou Miscioscia : Okay, thank you. Could you share how much 7-Mode was for the fiscal year that just ended? George Kurian : Immaterial, small numbers. Lou Miscioscia : Thank you. Good luck on the year. Kris Newton : Thank you, Lou. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Merrill Lynch. Wamsi Mohan : Yes, thank you. Quick clarification on the product gross margins, did NAND pricing have any impact on the quarter-on-quarter product gross margins I think you mentioned will be roughly flattish until fiscal 1Q as well, are you anticipating any puts and takes from NAND pricing within that? Ron Pasek : No, it was immaterial, product gross margin either from Q3 to Q4 or what I looking at into Q1 as well. Wamsi Mohan : Okay, great thanks Ron. And then you alluded to OpEx increase in the quarter really all driven by increase incentive comp from the outperformance, just wanted to understand your fiscal \u201919 commentary, do you expect absolute OpEx dollars to be down X potential outperformance or is that an all in comment? Ron Pasek : So we plan to make the plans, right? So if I look at the absolute OpEx dollars year-to-year they are actually going down now that we have that higher than expected Q4 results and therefore higher than expected compensation. There is some, so you get a reset of variable comp and then there's a little bit of headwinds due to FX on the OpEx side. All-in-all the full year is basically flat. Wamsi Mohan : Okay, great thanks a lot. George Kurian : We don\u2019t try to model outperformance in the base plan we build for the year, right? We target the base plan for OpEx to be that we achieve the annual operating plan of the company. The outperformance would be reflected in operating expense that is accrued to reflect the outperformance and will vary quarter-by-quarter depending on the performance year-to-date. Wamsi Mohan : Okay, thanks for the color George. Kris Newton : Thank you, Wamsi. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Sherri Scribner : Hi, thank you. I actually wanted to follow up on that question and thinking about the operating expenses declining as you guided to for the fiscal \u201919, what are the additional opportunities you have to reduce OpEx at this point? It seems like you guys have been through the process of taking out a lot of those expenses and if you're assuming that revenue is going to grow mid single digits, I guess I'm trying to understand how OpEx is going to be able to be flat to support that? Ron Pasek : So thanks for the question Sherri. We continue our transformation. There are a number of different initiatives we have going forward for the next several years really and they're different across each functions. In most cases we use that to fund other investments we are wanting to make, so you don't see the results of that necessarily. Occasionally yields restructuring charges as I mentioned in the call for Q1, but it\u2019s rather small. But we're continuing to disinvest and reinvest and that\u2019s how we're able to hold up that\u2019s roughly flat. Sherri Scribner : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks Sherri. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Milunovich with UBS. Steve Milunovich : Thank you. I wanted to ask you about America's commercial, I think it decelerated to about 3% growth year-over-year was there anything particularly going on there? And then on AFA side what percentage of your capacity and of your revenue of your leadership [ph] is off last at this point? George Kurian : The Americas commercial business continued to be good balanced book of business. We saw strength across all the different parts of the Americas theatre [ph] and strength in Canada. Latin Americas' performance varied by country. So, we feel good about the balance of business across the Americas. And it's reflective of us gaining share in terms of both net new customers as well as net new workloads in existing customers. I think the relative comparison of the Americas commercial business to other parts of the world we saw FX benefits for example helping us in Europe this fiscal year. With regard to AFA, of the capacity that we shipped 20% is roughly speaking the AFA capacity. It varies quarter-on-quarter, but I would just say it's in that ballpark. And from a config system perspective in terms of dollars, we have more than 50%, a good percentage more than 50% of systems are shipped out of the factory are now all flash arrays. So that lends support to our belief that strategic products are now the majority of our business and the strength of the strategic products growing at 25% year-over-year last quarter should lend support to the continued growth of NetApp. Steve Milunovich : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks Steve. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Ananda Baruah : Hi good afternoon guys. Congratulations on the strong quarter. Just one from me if I could, you guys did the higher end of the revenue guidance, do you feel like for the fourth quarter, do you feel like you've continued to gain momentum or you feel like the environment is gaining momentum in fiscal year \u201819 over the last couple of months and if so, if there's anything specific to point to from a product area or from an application area that will be great. Thanks a lot. George Kurian : You know, I would tell you that, IT spending broadly speaking reflects the economic landscape and I think that clarity on the economic outlook supports project based spending. I think we've also seen greater clarity in the enterprise in certain parts of the world around their applications for the cloud, so rather than hold projects waiting to decide about the cloud I think we're seeing people either move forward with cloud projects where we get the benefit or they say listen, I'm going to retrofit and upgrade my data center and modernize it because I'm not going to put that application on the cloud, so those are both secular trends that we saw through the course of the year. I think in terms of our own business, we continue to see people trying to look for data as a resource to expand business performance. So we've seen projects where in the medical sector data being used to help doctors make diagnoses faster, spend more time with the patient and similar corollaries for business effectiveness across various different verticals. And in terms of share, our performance has been very strong across all product categories and all geographies. Clearly, the focus is on the strategic products, all flash arrays, converged systems, hyper converged and cloud data services and there we are of course outpacing the market, but in aggregate that performance was balanced across all geographies, so we feel very good. Ananda Baruah : Okay, great and you feel like it\u2019s getting more pronounced as we move forward here through the beginning of the year, so momentum did you see the momentum building? George Kurian : We certainly had a strong finish to our year. I would say that our confidence is very good heading into this fiscal year, better than it has been at any time in my tenure as the CEO. So I feel very good about our position. Is that more reflective of the broader landscape? I tend to wait to see that. I'd let other vendors report and see. I don't want to characterize my perspective as reflective of the broader landscape, but we feel very good about the projects we're getting involved in and the expansion of our business opportunities. Ananda Baruah : Thank you, George. I really appreciate it. Kris Newton : Thanks Ananda. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Srini Nandury with Summit Insights Group. Srini Nandury : All right, thanks for taking my question. It's a big picture question again, how do you see the network storage evolve or next couple of years with the arrival of NVMe and what does this mean to the hyper conversion offerings in the market, do you think that it see device and speed and we could see the growth of networks that's going forward? Thank you. George Kurian : I think that network storage will always be a part of customers landscapes and there is always put and take as network speeds get better and better people can consolidate storage into shared storage environments that are network connected for manageability, efficiency and scaling and so NVMe is just another step in that path, right albeit a step-up in terms of lower latency. I think the real benefit of NVMe comes into play as really high performance storage media come into the market like storage class memories where you couple a super low latency network fabric with an even lower latency memory, but it's helpful even in today's environments. I think with regard to hyper converged, we still see that offerings like hyper converged are really allowing customers to rapidly deploy new application environments and get trying to project value much more diminished than traditional systems. We've never said that hyper converged will be all of computing and all of the storage, but there is a class of the market where a well designed modular hyper converged solution like we have which support separation of computer and storage and the addition of technologies like NVMe even into hyper converged offering with the common management plane is of real benefit to customers and there will be a part of that will always be there. Kris Newton : Thanks, Srini. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research. Steven Fox : Thanks. Good afternoon. You mentioned a couple times now that you gained share across all regions or all geographies. I was just curious if there's any differentiating factors by region that contributed to that growth? And then secondly with your all-flash array growth, I was wondering if there's any difference that you would highlight between Americas growth versus overseas growth? Thanks. George Kurian : I would say that in terms of the theatre performance or the geographic performance it was well balanced and even across all the major geographies and it reflects two themes, one is focus on execution from an innovation and go-to-market perspective and the quality of themes that we've built together with our partner distribution models in those geographies. I think those were consistent themes. I think there are of course regional differences, I think in the Americas and in parts of the world like Australia, New Zealand our cloud story is extraordinary helpful to customers. In other countries like in Germany or certain parts of Europe, our strength in certain verticals like manufacturing or financial services is perhaps of more importance. Right? So there are different considerations for each geography when you get down into the details, but overall we feel very good. In terms of all-flash array performance, we saw strength in multiple geographies. I think the Americas clearly is the largest part of our all-flash array business like it is of our overall business and performed really well, but we did see strength in all the geographies. Steven Fox : Great, thank you so much. Kris Newton : Thanks, Steve. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citi. Jim Suva : Thank you very much and congratulations Ron and George to your team. I have one question for each of you and I\u2019ll ask at the same time, so you can take in whichever order is preferred. So George on the competitive landscape with Hewlett Packard Enterprise had pretty good storage, Dell doing the huge release, have you seen like more competitive pricing, it's always a competitive market or have you seen just a more healthier markets because recent data point show that kind of most of you are kind of doing a fair amount better. And then the question for Ron. Ron, when you mention OpEx going down obviously it's going to go down I believe in both dollars as well as percent of sales just given where the math looks out. But can you help us gauge, the magnitude or even importantly the timing of linearity when we should expect that progress and progression to occur? And again thank you and congratulations to you and your team. George Kurian : Thank you. With regard to the competitive landscape, it's always been competitive. I think there are on any specific mix of players may shift or a period of time and the mix of transactions but it's always better competitive. I think there are on any specific transactional basis, there will be somebody who is trying to lead with price or discount heavily to keep footprint. I think what you seen from us this past quarter as you seen from us throughout the course of last year it continue to demonstrates sales discipline and extract the value of our software and increasingly the differentiation that we have in the cloud. Right, the cloud is a unique angle that we bring into transactions that make it very difficult for our traditional competitors to compete with. And I continue to see that as an opportunity to continue to differentiate us going forward, especially as our cloud data services become generally available and becomes even more of a comparative weapon for us. Ron Pasek : And Jim with respect to OpEx you\u2019re right, dollars are coming down slightly and the ways you think about it and if you look at the guide of Q1 it\u2019s up slightly year-over-year but as I said in my prepared remarks, transformation occurs throughout the year. As well as some of the compares later in the year have in FY\u201918 a lot of variable comps which right now we don't see, we planning for a 100% over that, so you're going to see some reductions all things meaningful later in the year just because of that. Kris Newton : Thank you, Jim. Next question? Jim Suva : Great, thanks so much for the details. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi with Lake Street. Eric Martinuzzi : My question is for Ron and it has to do with your outlook for the free cash flow of the business in FY\u201919, you talked about free cash flow as a percent of revenue in the range of 19% to 21%. And given the fact that the topline of the growing mid single digit, the gross margin is going to be roughly the same this year OpEx down slightly. You just finished the year and I think it was 22.6%, so I'm just wondering what's keeping that throttle back for FY\u201919? Ron Pasek : Yes, that was a good question. It\u2019s very, very slight and we actually talked about this at our financial Analyst Day. We talked about the build out of some of our cloud services and that would be an increase to CapEx above and beyond what you normally see that\u2019s the only headwind to free cash flow in FY\u201919. Eric Martinuzzi : And what\u2019s the linearity of that investment? Ron Pasek : It\u2019s a little frontend loaded in the front half of the year, so you should see that equalize as the year goes on. Eric Martinuzzi : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Eric. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Coster with J.P. Morgan. Paul Coster : Yes, thank you for taking the question. It's really about the cloud data services business and can you share with us any revenue run rate numbers associated with that business, can you can you kind of elaborate on maybe be the engagement level that you seeing sort of the private preview or any other data you\u2019re getting back to your partners there. And finally on the subject do you in time anticipate patience with go to [indiscernible] partners even in 2018? Thank you. Kris Newton : I\u2019m sorry Paul, your second part of the question broke up. Paul Coster : Yes, are there any customer engagements statistics you can share with us or any other data that\u2019s illustrative of the take up of your offerings through those three cloud service providers? George Kurian : We are in the foundational part of the year, in terms of operationalizing those cloud services. So we are entirely focused on getting those services up for commercial readiness and off the three hyper scalars we are generally available meaning in full commercial availability with AWS. We are in private preview with both Microsoft and Google, and we will provide you more details of the availability as we go through the course of the year. I think that we are very excited at the customer interest and the uptake. We have several hundred customers in these private previews well above our plan and in fact we're oversold and not taken anymore at this point which proves the relevance of the capabilities that we bring to those customers. I would say that the majority of those customers are net new to NetApp, meaning not existing customers, so we\u2019ve seen a lot of new logos for net new workloads or net new customers to NetApp which we are excited about. And in terms of the engagement models, with regard to the partners we are readying a cloud focus partner program. We will make announcements of that at our upcoming partner conference. There will be some of our traditional partners who will have the capability to participate, but it will also require us to recruit some new partners and so we're going to focus on that this year. I'm very excited. We are already winning on-premises footprints before the commercial availability of the cloud services because of our roadmap. I'll give you an example of an all-flash array win that we had against one of our pure play competitors where the fact that the customer had a roadmap to Azure and wanted to have a solution for Dr. in Azure allowed us to win not only their future cloud business but also of their entire data center upgrade to an all-flash array. So we will get you more details and visibility as the services become more operational, but we're excited about where we are, really excited. Paul Coster : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Paul. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Unidentified Analyst : Hi guys. This is Victor [indiscernible] for Simon Leopold. I wanted to drill down a little bit on the traction that you're seeing with your customers around your hyper converged solution because your approach embraces a slightly different architecture compared to what you know most would recognize as traditional ACI under the strict definitions. So first I guess, how would you describe your customers reception from what you seen so far to the approach of scaling the computing storage separately and secondly do they see the desegregation of the computer storage as an advantage versus your competitors or are they just more focused on the performance versus some of the incumbents that you see in the market? George Kurian : We are focused on the enterprise segment of hyper converged. Traditionally hyper converged infrastructure was sold more into a departmental environment for a single application, typically for virtual desktop infrastructure and then in some cases for non-production single purpose use cases, where a departmental owner was making the project decision. We are much more focused on the future growth of the hyper converged market which is in the enterprise as even the hyper converged vendors would tell you and in those cases our value proposition is clearly resonating. Right? The customer wins that we have had against the competition and there have been notable ones, have been about this value proposition of a modular system that scale, storage and compute efficiently and lowers the cost of over provisioned resources, licenses and simplified upgrade cycles. It allows them to run mixed workloads in customer after customer where we've beaten one of the incumbents in HCI, it is because of our ability to support production class mix workloads. So we feel very good about our positioning and the initial value prop. We are not targeting the entire hyper converged market, but a very specific large segment of it where we think we've got a winning architecture. Unidentified Analyst : Excellent, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks Victor. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with RBC. Amit Daryanani : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I guess the question is really on capital allocation, any sense on how should we think about the new buyback tranches that you have announced, the pace of it relative to the way you guys did the last tranche, how is it helpful and then how do you think the dividend growth as you go forward as well in the model? Ron Pasek : So, as we indicated as our financial Analyst Day, I\u2019m not really giving any timeline. We'll give you the details after the fact, so if we do a repurchase in Q1 we will certainly tell you about that, but we\u2019re not going to telegraph the timing. Amit Daryanani : Got it. And I guess if I just followup, Ron I think you mentioned ASC 606 in totality or mutual impact or immaterial I think is as what you said, in July gross margins is there any benefit from that transition for you? Ron Pasek : No, again in total I\u2019m only guiding the total gross margin, so no benefit. When we report you should see as I indicated at Analyst Day, you would see product margins slightly higher and services margins slight lower partly because of the allocation methodology. So again, I\u2019m not guiding at that level but I did indicate that at financial Analyst Day. Amit Daryanani : Got it. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Amit. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Kurtz with KeyBanc. Unidentified Analyst : Hi guys, this is [indiscernible] on for Alex. I was wondering what trends you guys are seeing in the high end scale-out system market and I was wondering if pricing stabilized there in these multi terabyte type deals? George Kurian : I would tell you that these large transactions are always competitive. I think the differentiation is really in software and the ability to scale-out system. I think in our situation for scale-out file systems the technology that we brought out in ONTAP 9 which is called FlexGroup gives us linear scaling and performance advantages over most of the competition and so we feel very well positioned. We have taken back several footprints from Isilon in that segment of the market and frankly they're trying to chase us now to try to scale up their solutions. With regard to [indiscernible] storage we've seen increasing momentum though it's a small business for us, we've seen increasing momentum through the course of the year. Our unique offering there is to allow customers to build a hybrid architecture that spans availability zones within your own enterprise boundary as well as some of the public hyperscalars and that is unique in the market and is allowing us to win deals against the competition. The number of competitors in objects storage continues to diminish and some of the players become pure cloud offerings or end up in unviable positions in the market. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks Steve. Next question? Operator : Thank you. And our final question will come from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. Nehal Chokshi : Yes, thank you for taking my question. So if I look at the midpoint of your guidance, I think that implies product revenue would decline about 20% Q over Q which is a little bit more than your past two July quarters. And then when I also put that into context that your DSOs was up 11 days year-over-year and you did note that was due to a strong finish which indeed was, and congratulations on that, but the concern is here as that, is this less than seasonal guidance due to concern regarding having drained a pipeline or is it just your general conservatism? Ron Pasek : We did do better than we thought in Q4. I wouldn\u2019t say we drained the pipeline, still we could see in Q1 year-over-year is a - even it\u2019s after currency it is 5.5% growth, so we\u2019re happy with that. And you know as George indicated there is - we want to make sure we give numbers that we can, we know we can meet or beat, so there is some general conservatism. Nehal Chokshi : Okay, thank you. Kris Newton : All right, thank you Nehal and before we go George has a couple closing remarks. George Kurian : Thank you everyone. It was a fantastic finish to a great year. We are well positioned to continue our momentum by enabling our customers' data driven digital transformation and addressing their biggest IT imperatives, inspiring innovation in the cloud, building clouds to accelerate new services and modernizing IT architectures with cloud connected Flash. We will continue to drive results in fiscal year \u201919 by remaining focused on our transformation priorities, aligning to the high growth areas of the market and focusing on reaching more customers in more ways. Maintaining our disciplined approach to enabling investment in big opportunities by deemphasizing areas with less return potential and finally continuing to balance shareholder returns with investment in the business for long term growth. I'm really excited for fiscal year \u201919. We\u2019re entering the New Year, clearly the best position in my tenure and I am confident in our ability to achieve the goals that we laid out at our Analyst Day. Thank you for your time today and I look forward to speaking with you next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

Welcome to NetApp\u2019s First Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. I will now turn the call over to Kris Newton, Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Ms. Newton, you may begin. Kris Newton : Thank you for joining us on our Q1 fiscal year 2019 earnings call. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Ron Pasek. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com. In Q1, we adopted the new accounting standard ASC 606, a historical financial results have been restated to confirm for the new accounting revenue recognition rules. Reconciliations of our previously reported GAAP results to the restated 606 GAAP results as well as 606 GAAP to non-GAAP results for fiscal 2017 and 2018 by quarter are included in our Q1 earnings release, which is posted on our website, along with our financial tables and guidance, a historical supplemental data table, and the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation. As a reminder, during today\u2019s call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future projections, such as our guidance for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2019, our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns, and our ability to grow and expand our opportunities, all of which involve risks and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons, including global political, macroeconomic and market conditions and our ability to expand our total available market, introduce and deliver new and differentiated products and services without disruption, manage our gross profit margins, capitalize on our market position in cloud strategy, maintain execution, and continue our capital allocation strategy. Please also refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC and available on our website, specifically our most recent Form 10-K for fiscal year 2018 and our current reports on Form 8-K. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP and 606, unless otherwise indicated. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to George. George Kurian : Thanks, Kris. Welcome, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We delivered a very strong first quarter and are starting fiscal year 2019 in a stronger position than we\u2019ve been in for years. Revenue, gross margin, operating margin and earnings per share were all above our guidance. This performance reflects our success with customers, who increasingly view us as a critical strategic partner for their data-driven digital transformation. Enterprises see the value of our Data Fabric strategy and are signaling strong confidence in NetApp by making long-term investments in our software IP to enable the Data Fabric across their entire enterprise. The world is being transformed by digital technology. To succeed in this data-driven economy and radically improve business performance, customers need real-time insights and secure access to their data, regardless of where it resides. The NetApp Data Fabric empowers our customers to do so, while taking advantage of capabilities in the cloud across multiple hyperscalers, operate with hyperscaler cloud-like infrastructure, and modernize traditional IT with flash and connections to the cloud. These capabilities underpin the biggest market transitions as customers shift to cloud, new forms of converged infrastructure and flash, and we continue to expand our opportunity by innovating with the Data Fabric, broadening its reach by delivering the next-generation of flash-empowered SAN and integration with the hyperscalers, as well as increasing its value with new applications and services such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and analytics. We continue to deliver software-differentiated innovation and maintain strong momentum across our key priority areas, all-flash arrays, new forms of converged infrastructure, and cloud data services, which represents the biggest opportunities for NetApp to grow and reset the landscape of our industry. The market transition to flash, which is still in the early stages, creates enormous new opportunity for us as we consolidate and displace competitors\u2019 legacy equipment, gain share in new workload deployments, and upgrade our installed base with our cloud connected all-flash solutions. At the start of Q1, we expanded our all-flash array innovation leadership with the introduction of the AFF A800, designed for high-performance in cloud to power artificial intelligence and data-intensive applications like machine learning. The AFF A800 supports the industry\u2019s first end-to-end NVMe architecture, combining NVMe\u2019s solid state drives with NVMe over Fiber Channel to deliver lightning fast response times. Based on the new SPC-1 benchmark results, performed under real-world conditions with deduplication and compression-enabled, the AFF A800 is the top performing enterprise all-flash array among the industry\u2019s leading storage providers. With the latest version of ONTAP, which we shipped during the quarter, we continue to expand our SAN technology leadership by delivering NVMe over Fiber Channel capability as a non-disruptive software upgrade on current-generation AFF platforms. NVMe over Fabric gives customers the performance of server-attached storage with all the benefits of shared network storage. Our leadership in this area allows us to further expand our opportunity by displacing direct attached storage over time. In Q1, our all-flash array business, inclusive of all-flash FAS, EF, and SolidFire products and services grew 50% year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run rate of $2.2 billion. Validating the innovation leadership and momentum of this part of our business, Gartner again recognized NetApp as a leader in its Magic Quadrant for Solid-State Arrays. Another way we\u2019re expanding our opportunity is through participation in the rapidly growing area of artificial intelligence. Earlier this month, we announced ONTAP AI, a solution combining NVIDIA DGX supercomputers and the AFF A800 to create a seamless data pipeline across edge, core, and cloud for deep learning deployments. The unique scope and reach of the Data Fabric enables customers to lay down the right foundation to collect and bring together all their distributed data and then apply artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to it. By helping customers unify all of their data for AI, we empower them to deliver better business outcomes. Enterprises are choosing our converged and hyper-converged solutions to build out their private clouds, because they\u2019re simple, standardized, and rapidly deployed. FlexPod continues to be a platform for customer innovation and investment protection. In the first quarter, we announced new FlexPod solutions to simplify the delivery of cloud infrastructure and deliver focused industry-specific applications. With NetApp HCI, customers are able to accelerate digital transformation by developing a next-generation cloud architected infrastructure that manages data and services as one integrated resource, supporting both public and private clouds. A European-based financial services firm chose NetApp HCI to be the foundation for its private cloud. Our ability to provide a future-proof platform to host current workloads and support future multi-cloud requirements, enables us to win against Nutanix. With cloud like simplicity, NetApp HCI offers enterprises the ability to run multiple applications with predictable performance, as well as scale compute and storage resources independently to avoid costly and inefficient over-provisioning, capabilities that the first generation HCI vendors cannot match. Our cloud data services partnerships with Microsoft, Amazon, and Google are unique to the industry and are game changing for NetApp\u2019s long-term opportunity. Not only are we able to participate in enterprise workloads that are moved to the cloud, we can address born in the cloud workloads and customers, and our entire portfolio is made stronger by being cloud connected.  Five years of delivering ONTAP as software in the hyperscaler marketplaces has given us the unique understanding of the requirements in the cloud. We have identified how to deliver high-performance, highly scalable cloud data services with a robust feature set and support for protocols the cloud does not natively provide. Because of the leverage in our R&D we have been able to bring hundreds of engineers to bear on this problem without negatively impacting innovation in other areas of our business or expanding our OpEx stack. Only NetApp has partnerships with all the leading hyperscalers and a complete cloud data services strategy for customers. In July, Microsoft announced the public preview of Azure NetApp Files, an Azure native service powered by NetApp technology, enabling enterprises to overcome the challenge of deploying file-based workloads to the cloud. Also in July, we announced expanded availability for NetApp cloud volumes for Google Cloud platform to help customers deploy workloads, such as DevOps, video rendering, databases and commercial high-performance computing. In Q4, we began onboarding customers with NetApp cloud volumes for AWS. To bring to life, why a customer would choose NetApp in the cloud, I\u2019ll share with you two examples : one, that is a cloud-only solution; and the other a customer of our on-premises solutions expanding into the cloud. The first is a large genomic information company that shows NetApp cloud volumes for AWS and plans to go live with NetApp Services in other clouds. They selected us, because our high-performance, shared storage service enabled them to gain dramatic improvements in processing and complete analyses that they could never finish before, all while lowering their compute costs. They are recommending that their customers, pharmaceutical companies and hospitals adopt cloud volumes. With cloud volumes, they offer consistent performance and advanced functionality, while allowing their customers freedom of choice on the cloud. The second example is a global fashion brand taking its first steps into the cloud. Because of our multi-year relationship with the customer, we were able to help them understand the value of our cloud data services, while reducing their sense of risk. In addition to the purchase of SaaS backup services from NetApp, they expanded their footprint of on-premises all-flash arrays. Fiscal 2019 is a foundational year for the SaaS part of our business. And I\u2019m pleased to report that based on Q1, our annualized monthly recurring cloud data services revenue is approximately $20 million. We are transforming our business to reflect the way customers want to consume our technology. The world is steadily moving from being compute-centric to data-centric, and customer consumption patterns are shifting from data center equipment to hybrid cloud services. Our competitors are struggling to adapt to the new cloud era and continue to fall behind. With demonstrated leadership in key market transitions, we are reshaping our industry. We will share more industry changing news with you at our Insight Conference this October. Our results are evidence that we have the right strategy and are driving success with focused innovation and relentless execution. As we continue to grow and transform, we will maintain our focus on efficiency and shareholder value. At our last Analyst Day, we laid out a compelling long-term model and capital allocation plan. And as you can see by our strong Q1 results and capital returns, we are on track to deliver against this plan. I\u2019m honored, excited and humbled by the opportunity ahead. I want to thank the entire NetApp team and our partner ecosystem for all they do to help drive our success. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ron to walk through our Q1 financial performance and go-forward expectations. Ron? Ron Pasek : Thanks, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, we adapted the new revenue recognition rules ASC 606 this quarter. Our historical financial results have been restated to conform to the new accounting rules. Reconciliations of our previously reported GAAP results to the restated 606 GAAP results, as well as our 606 GAAP to non-GAAP results for fiscal 2017 and 2018 by quarter are included in our Q1 earnings release. As a reminder, I\u2019ll be referring to non-GAAP results unless otherwise noted. Our Q1 results reflect the increasing strategic importance of NetApp to our customers, as they undertake digital transformations and embrace multi-cloud architectures. We expect continued progress throughout fiscal 2019 towards the long-term business model we laid out at our Analyst Day. Before discussing guidance, I\u2019ll provide detail on our performance for the first quarter. Net revenues of $1.47 billion grew 12% year-over-year, driven by product revenue of $875 million, which increased 20% year-over-year. Product revenue came in higher than expected, reflecting the continued strength of our all-flash array business, as well as roughly $16 million from strategic enterprise agreements, which we did not include in the Q1 guidance. Enterprise license agreements or ELAs or enterprise-wide deals where NetApp is a key strategic partner in implementing the customer\u2019s broader digital transformation. From a revenue recognition perspective, the new 606 standard requires the software product components of ELAs to be recognized upfront. Under the old 605 standard, these software licensing agreements were recognized ratably across the life of the deal, typically three years. The increase in ELAs reflects our strategic presence within large global accounts and there\u2019s strong confidence in the value of the NetApp Data Fabric. While a clear positive for our business momentum, the structure of these ELAs, coupled with the upfront revenue recognition, makes their financial impact lumpy and difficult to predict. We did, however, include about $30 million of revenue from ELAs in the guide for Q1. Moving forward, we will continue to take a conservative approach in predicting the timing and size of these strategic deals. As such, we will not be including ELAs in our guidance for Q2 nor the remainder of fiscal 2019. Moving down the P&L, software maintenance revenues of $229 million increased 3% year-over-year, reflecting traction of our cloud data services portfolio and continued growth in our installed base. Hardware maintenance and other services revenues of $370 million were flat year-over-year. As a reminder, we said that the combination of software and hardware maintenance revenues should not be a headwind in fiscal 2019. Gross margin was 66%, above the high-end of our guidance range. Product gross margin of 56% increased 6 points year-over-year, reflecting the benefit from the software portion of the ELAs and continued sales force discipline. Excluding ELAs, product margin was approximately 51%, up 1.5 points year-on-year. Hardware maintenance and other services gross margin was up 2 points year-on-year due to the benefits from ongoing transformation efforts. Operating expenses of $650 million were in line with our expectations. We remain committed to strong OpEx discipline and expect operating expenses for fiscal 2019 to be roughly flat year-over-year. Operating margin of 22% was above our guided range. We had a strong start to the capital allocation plan we announced at our Analyst Day. During the quarter, we repurchased 6.7 million shares at an average price of $74.37 per share for a total of $500 million. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were $269 million, down $4 million sequentially and $9 year-over-year. EPS of $1.04 was up 75% year-over-year, predominantly driven by the healthy growth in product revenues and expansion in product gross margin. We closed Q1 with $4.8 billion in cash and short-term investments. Similar to Q4, we again saw healthy growth in deferred and finance unearned services revenue, which increased 4% year-over-year. During the quarter, we paid out $105 million in cash dividends. Our fiscal Q2 cash dividend of $0.40 per share is payable on October 24. As highlighted at our Analyst Day, we remain committed to increasing our dividend over time. Our cash conversion cycle of negative 20 days improved to 28 days year-over-year, reflecting a 23-day increase in days payable outstanding and an eight-day decrease in days inventory outstanding, partially offset by a one-day increase in DSO. DSO decreased by 20 days sequentially from Q4. We had another outstanding quarter of cash generation with cash flow from operations of $326 million, an increase of 30% year-over-year. We generated strong free cash flow of $262 million in the quarter, which represented 18% of net revenues and as an increase of 22% year-over-year. Now on to guidance. To clarify, we remain confident in our mid single-digit fiscal 2019 revenue growth forecast before any benefit from Q1 ELAs or any additional ELAs we may realize throughout the year. In addition, we are raising our guidance for fiscal 2019 margins and EPS to reflect the better than expected Q1 results. Gross margin guidance increases to 63% to 64%, up from 63%, and operating margin guidance increases to approximately 22%, up from 20% to 21%. In fiscal 2019, we are now committed to delivering EPS growth in the mid-20s the versus the original guidance of greater than 15%. Our fiscal 2019 effective tax rate of approximately 18% remains unchanged. We expect to continue to generate meaningful free cash flow in the range of 19% to 21% of revenues, enabling our disciplined approach to investing in growth, as well as our continued commitment of returning significant capital to shareholders. We also remain confident in our long-term three-year growth forecast for revenue and profitability. Now on to Q2. As a reminder, Q2 guidance excludes any benefit from ELAs. We expect net revenues to range between $1.45 billion and $1.55 billion, which at the midpoint implies a 6% increase year-over-year, including more than a half a point of currency headwind. We expect Q2 consolidated gross margin to range between 63% and 64%. We expect fiscal Q2 operating margin to range between 20% and 21%. We expect earnings per share for the second quarter to range between $0.94 and $1 per share. In summary, I\u2019m confident regarding our growth opportunities, especially as it relates to our compelling cloud strategy. Additionally, I\u2019m very pleased with the disciplined execution of our team. We are well-positioned to continue to deliver on the commitments we\u2019ve made to our shareholders, partners and customers. With that, I\u2019ll hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris Newton : I\u2019ll now open the call for Q&A. Please be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to one question, so we can get to as many people as possible. Thanks for your cooperation. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Rod Hall : Yes. Hi, guys, thanks for the question. I guess, I wanted to dig into the product gross margins, which are quite a bit stronger than we expected them to be? And see if you guys can tease out maybe what some of the moving parts there were? So in other words, with NAND price declines, did that help the margins? Are there mix effects going on? Just maybe give us a little bit more color on what drove those strong margins? Thanks. George Kurian : So, Rod, I think it\u2019s a couple things. Obviously, it was benefit of the ELAs this quarter, that was about 2 points when you do the bridge year-over-year. We also had a little bit of favorable FX, and we had a little higher software mix this quarter. The NAND pricing definitely did help a little bit, but it gets offset when you have to take the hit to resell. So there might have been some benefit initially, but then you have to write the inventory down as the standard decreases. Rod Hall : Could you also just say on that front, are you passing NAND pricing through pretty much, or what\u2019s your thinking on that as we go on through the rest of the year? George Kurian : Our intent will be to eventually pass on the price decreases, yes. Rod Hall : Great. Okay, I appreciate it. Kris Newton : Thanks, Rod. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. George, when you look into January and April call of next year, I\u2019m not I asking for any guide. I just wanted to see what your views are in terms of the continued upgrade that is going on within your enterprise customers? This has proven to be a multi-year upgrade cycle? And I want to see how much \u2013 how do you see this upgrade cycle sustaining beyond the October quarter that you just guided to? Thank you. George Kurian : We see that enterprise IT spending, as you have noted, is benefiting primarily from the strength of the global economic outlook. IT spending, we\u2019ve always believed is correlated with economic outlook. Within that, we benefit from a few different specific situations relative to our business. From a portfolio of technology perspective, we have shifted our investment and our portfolio and consequently our revenue mix into high-growth areas of the market. We see that we can benefit uniquely when customers spend either on the public cloud or on-premises unlike competitors that we have that remain only on-premises. And finally, as businesses become more data-intensive and builds more data-intensive environments like machine learning, high performance storage, and data services are benefiting from spending intentions. So, we think that this will continue for a period of time. I think, at the macro level, IT spending will be correlated to economic growth. So if economic growth slows down, I think it will impact IT spending in aggregate. Mehdi Hosseini : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Manny. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Srini Nandury with Summit Insights Group. Srini Nandury : All right. Thank you for taking my question. On the AFA sales, can you give us some color of what percentage of installed base has already moved to the new AFA? And then, can you also give me some color on in terms of competition in unit pricing in general? Thank you. George Kurian : AFAs are now 14% of our installed base, so it still remains a small percentage of the installed base. As we said, we have continued to gain share in the market and outpace the overall market. This is the 15th consecutive quarter of market outperformance and reflects the strength of our offering. Relative to competition, I think we see the broad mix that\u2019s available in the market. Dell, HP, Pure, and Nutanix are the most common ones. I think, we have a really good competitive position against all of them, both because of the capabilities of our specific solutions as well as the unique benefit we bring by allowing customers to deploy our solutions on the public cloud or in their data center, something that we call the Data Fabric, so our win rates have been strong, and we\u2019re excited to expand the range of competitive situations we engage in. Kris Newton : Thank you, Srini. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Good afternoon. Just a quick clarification and then a question. On the clarification, I believe the prior EPS guidance of 15%-plus reflected no assumption around share repurchase. Just curious whether the mid-20% EPS guidance does include buyback or not? And then secondly, can you just give us some guardrails around what you expect in terms of range of potential outcomes for ELAs in future quarters? Will there be quarters with zero ELA revenue and then quarters like July, where it could be $50 million to $100 million? What\u2019s sort of the ranges of outcomes as we think about modeling that through in the next couple of quarters? Ron Pasek : Sure. Katy, to answer the first part of your question, we assumed the guide for EPS assumes no further share repurchase. So it\u2019s just what we\u2019ve done in Q1 and the benefit of that from a diluted share comp perspective. Secondly, with respect to ELAs, this is really difficult to predict when they\u2019ll happen. And to your point, yes, there will be quarters when they will be zero, which is precisely why I said, I would not guide them. It\u2019s \u2013 even when you think you might get one, it\u2019s hard to predict and the timing is very difficult. And they are so large that if you include it and you miss it, it would be a big miss. I\u2019m trying to think of that \u2013 was there one other part? George Kurian : This is why, I think, we \u2013 as we laid out the plan for the year, we are reconfirming that our revenue outlook is mid single-digit without ELAs. ELAs would be additive to the revenue baseline that we have established. And so if you think about it, we\u2019re essentially guiding upward for the rest of the year. Katy Huberty : Okay, understood. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Katy. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : Yes, thank you, and thanks for taking the question. Yes, I wanted to ask about the HCI product. I think, one of the pieces of the story has been the strong growth that you\u2019ve been able to report quarter-after-quarter in your flash business. I\u2019m curious as we think about HCI and the competitive landscape against Nutanix and others, is that an incremental revenue stream that we could look at over the next couple of quarters that starts to get broken out? And is there any framing or any kind of qualitative or quantitative commentary you can provide of how big that business is today? Thank you. George Kurian : With regard to whether we will breakout HCI or not, we\u2019ll provide you that clarity when we do it. At this point, HCI is a part of our product revenue. We have seen a broader number of competitive engagements and we are winning our share, right? So we feel very confident about the value proposition that we bring to the market. We see that it\u2019s a meaningful expansion of the total addressable market that we serve, and we\u2019re going to continue to stay focused on innovation and consumer expansion. We\u2019ve had good competitive wins against all the leading competitors in that category. And it reflects the architectural difference that we bring to enterprise grade hyper-converged. And so we\u2019ll give you more details. Come to NetApp Insight, we have some really exciting product announcements at NetApp Insight, and you\u2019ll see how we build NetApp HCI into our compelling Data Fabric story there. So look forward to it. Aaron Rakers : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Aaron. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Tim Long : Thank you. Just one and a follow-up, if could. First, on the cloud data services. Thanks for providing the run rate there. Is \u2013 I think the thinking \u2013 the logic was this could add something like 100 basis points of growth this year. Could you talk a little bit if you would have to ramp from these levels? Could you talk a little bit about the pipeline and how quick quickly you think this business could ramp? And then second, just some clarification on the ELAs. I get the difficulty to predict, but could you talk a little bit about the other benefits, whether it\u2019s increasing installed base, more equipment sales, that are ancillary benefits of these larger strategic deals that you\u2019re signing? Thank you. George Kurian : Let me just start with the cloud data services business outlook. As we said, we are off to a good start. We\u2019re excited about the value we bring to customers. We talked about both cloud native customers, who we\u2019d never served, as well as expanding large footprint with both \u2013 with enterprise customers who we\u2019ve served in the past and both of those opportunities are in front of us. With regard to the availability of our offerings that we said, we are \u2013 generally available with AWS. We are in private preview with Microsoft, and we are in pre-data with Google. So we are in an early stage of customer trials. All of these offerings should be generally commercially available this quarter. So you\u2019ll see much broader availability of those offerings this quarter, and the pipeline is healthy. We are excited at what we see going forward in terms of the used cases, DevOps, analytics, as well as database as a service on the public cloud. With regard to the ELAs, let me just say that I\u2019ve been involved in these transactions. As Ron mentioned, they are strategic relationships with the largest customers in the world, where they standardize on our software across a broad part of their enterprise. It is a validation of the strategic value of our NetApp Data Fabric that customers are buying into a broad footprint standardizing on the Data Fabric. But as Ron mentioned, these are complex transactions, where they can shift between CapEx and ELA and a variety of different structures within the ELA. One of the things that you see with this year\u2019s ELA form is that, our operating system is now a standard part of the ELA, which is an indication that our Data Fabric now becomes seeded in a very large footprint in the biggest customers in the world. And so we\u2019re excited. We think this is bullish for NetApp. And Ron can tell you more about how we think about it specifically in terms of the financial aspect of our business. Ron Pasek : I think, it is a validation of our technology. It\u2019s something that we\u2019re really happy about. They are long-term commitments and agreements of these customers. And just to give a little perspective, they\u2019ve really grown from when we started adding the OS portion into the ELA offerings. Last year, when we did the restatement in FY 2018 for 606, the full-year was only $20 million in ELA. So growing now to at least $90 million just in Q1, you can see, it\u2019s a big uptick, so very, very important. It will make our results from time to time within the year little lumpy. So you can see a little more volatility in gross margin, but over the long-term really no effect. Tim Long : Thank you. George Kurian : It also doesn\u2019t change the fundamental seasonality of our business, right? I think it just reflects the nature of transactions that are lumpy and hard to predict, but it doesn\u2019t change the fundamental seasonality of our business. Tim Long : Okay. Thank you. Kris Newton : All right. Thank you, Tim. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Sherri Scribner with Deutsche Bank. Sherri Scribner : Hi, thank you. Just thinking about the gross margin guidance for the full-year, it seems pretty low considering how high margins were this quarter. I understand the ELAs helped significantly in the quarter. But how should we think about margins rolling through as we move through the year? Ron Pasek : So it \u2013 what I did Sherri was I kept the same guide we had previously gave at Analyst Day for the year, and simply added the benefit of the Q1 over achievement, nothing else has fundamentally changed to George\u2019s earlier point, the underlying seasonality is still the same. George Kurian : I think one thing to note Sherry is that, our product revenue is growing much strong, much faster than service revenue. So if you model it on a year-on-year compare, the mix continues to save a product, which is at a lower gross margin than services, right? And so we continued to push towards the long-term commitments that we had made around product gross margins in the 55% range. We\u2019re making progress, but it\u2019s the mix of product and services that are affecting the full-year gross margin picture. Sherri Scribner : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, Sherry. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. Andrew Nowinski : Great. Thank you and nice quarter tonight. I just wanted to get more color on your AFA growth basis. So you\u2019re the only vendor shipping an end-to-end NVMe solution right now. And you\u2019re the only vendor that separated your hardware from software enabling customers to support hybrid cloud environment, and you also have the HCI option. So I\u2019m wondering if the acceleration in your AFA growth rate from just \u2013 more from just existing NetApp customers that converted off last this quarter, or is it the additional offerings like HCI in the cloud services that you have? Did that alter your win rate versus vendors like Pure Storage and EMC that don\u2019t have those offering more often to accelerate your new customer growth? George Kurian : I think, if you look at the installed base penetration of the AFA, they\u2019re at 14%, which is a small number. This represents the fact that the majority of our wins are in new workloads and at existing customers or net new customers. The strength of our hybrid cloud story is a major part of our value proposition, because simply speaking, we allow customers to do what no one else can. You can start to build a high-performance machine learning environment in the public cloud and when you\u2019re comfortable with doing so, you can move it on-premises with your data completely intact and secure or conversely you can build a secure data lake in your own data center and give you a data scientists public cloud work spaces that are compliant with GDPR regulations. So we have a really unique value proposition in the marketplace. With end-to-end and NVMe, we are also able to attack direct attack server workloads, because we offer the same performance of server connected storage with all the benefits of shared network storage, efficiency, single point of management, better fault-tolerant and so on. And so that\u2019s an additive part of the market that we are able to go after.  c: Andrew Nowinski : Great. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, Andy. Next question? Operator : Our next question is from Lou Miscioscia with Daiwa Capital Markets America. Lou Miscioscia : Yes. So thanks for taking my call. So just two quick questions. The first one is on guidance. I know that you\u2019re actually guiding to mid single digits year-over-year growth, but I guess, last quarter you did also talk about sequential growth. And if I look at my model, if I\u2019m modeling this correctly, if you actually grow sequentially at a normal, let\u2019s call it, 5% or 6%, you should actually be at the high-end of the range. So maybe you can give us just some puts and takes and thinking as to why from a quarter-to-quarter basis, the balance isn\u2019t a bit higher here? And congratulations obviously on good numbers. Ron Pasek : So, Joe [sic] [Lou] the \u2013 as I said earlier, the benefit in Q1, we had a large ELA benefit that blew away the guide we gave for the quarter. The underlying seasonality is still there. As I tried to indicate, the ELAs will make some of the seasonality a little more lumpy. So you\u2019re right. Sequentially, it is down from Q1 to Q2. However, Q2 guide that we gave is up year-over-year, I\u2019d say, 6% with a little bit of currency headwind. So you\u2019re going to see a little bit of some anomalies as we go forward. When we have these ELAs, they\u2019re going to make things a little bit less predictable. Lou Miscioscia : Okay, great. Thank you. In the press release you did mention StorageGRID twice. I\u2019m just wondering if that product is starting to see traction in the sense that object storage has been a little bit slow to take off and obviously you\u2019re doing so well in some of the other areas, but it\u2019d be nice to get a little visibility here? George Kurian : StorageGRID is now a recognized leader in objects storage. We see a range of use cases for StorageGRID either for new object deployments or coupled with the file system as an archival tier using our FabricPool technology. We will provide more details of the applications of StorageGRID at our Insight User Conference. There are some interesting use cases for automotive and some other IoT examples, where a highly scalable solution like StorageGRID has really interesting applications. I will tell you more at Insight. Lou Miscioscia : Okay. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Lou. Next question? Operator : The next question is from George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer. George Iwanyc : Thank you for taking my question. George, your mature products are doing very well. Can you give us a sense of what\u2019s driving the strength there and how sustainable the outlook is? George Kurian : So as we said, the headwind from mature are \u2013 have dissipated. The mature product category used to contain three components : OEM, our legacy 7-Mode technology and add-on storage, driven either by 7-Mode or our clustered storage systems in all-flash arrays. OEM has done \u2013 has had a good quarter. It can be lumpy through the course of the year depending on the performance of our OEMs, but we had a strong quarter this quarter. 7-Mode is basically not being sold anymore, so it\u2019s no longer relevant to our business. And add-on storage had a strong quarter, reflecting the strength of our all-flash array business. So what I would tell you is, categorizing mature and strategic as separate items is no longer relevant, right? Because a large part of the mature business is now being driven by the strength of our strategic products. And so I think that\u2019s a better way to look forward is just to look at the aggregate product revenue, which you can see is very strong. We don\u2019t think that mature is going to be a headwind anymore. And as we said last year, could be also a tailwind to our position this year. And so we\u2019re excited at the start. We think that we should continue to see good progress in our mature \u2013 in the mature bucket. George Iwanyc : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, George. Next question? Operator : Your next question is from Jim Suva with Citi. Jim Suva : Thank you very much, George. The all-flash array traction you have has been absolutely fantastic. It\u2019s, as you know, a very dynamic marketplace, where a lot of up-and-coming companies have claimed victory and going to really disrupt things. Yet, some of the more traditional companies who\u2019ve been innovating throughout time how much yourself have continued to gain share and knock them off, so to speak. Can you talk a little bit about the all-flash array landscape and how you see it? Is there still a lot more new start-ups innovation? Do you think it\u2019s going to be a consolidating market? How should we view it? I assume that large corporations want established companies such as yourself and others. But can you just walk us through about the all-flash array, from where you sit as CEO, the marketplace you see? George Kurian : We see that, first of all, the core value in the all-flash array market is in world-class software that allows customers to deploy a range of media, but to drive their business process for advantage, right? And I think, we have really good software. And I think, any other company that wants to compete in that market has to have really good software. We see that the 3D NAND environment will continue to materially benefit flash over performance drives over the next few years. As we have said consistently, as prices ameliorate for 3D NAND, which we are starting to see clearly, that performance drive, the 10-K drive segment will concede to the all-flash array segment. There are future derivatives of flash, capacity flash or things like persistent memory, Optane DIMM, for which we have really good solutions for. And I think, we feel that what customers will need is a single way to manage your data across, not only all of these types of media, but all the places you put data in, which we call the Data Fabric, right? I think, the legacy competitors are in a variety of states of challenge. I think, if you look at the large players like EMC or HP, they\u2019re still trying to rationalize their lead flash portfolio, because none of their products is complete. If you look at players like IBM and Hitachi and Fujitsu and Oracle, they basically conceded and are no longer in sort of new deployment considerations. They\u2019re essentially defending the installed base and the start-ups are challenged. They have essentially been fast on product innovation, and they don\u2019t have the market reach to compete. So it will be, I see some sense of consolidation coming up in the marketplace and we will benefit from that, because we\u2019re very well-positioned. And it\u2019s a matter of keeping your head down and executing, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. Jim Suva : Thank you so much for the detailed clarification. Kris Newton : Thank you, Jim. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Ananda Baruah : Hi, guys. Congrats on the solid results. Hey, if in case I missed it, have you yet begun to see a positive benefit in your all-flash array sales when NAND ASP declines? And then could you just quickly give us an update as you get begin to see inside the cloud data services customers come back to you, kind of almost as you \u2013 well, when we start to see them come back, so obviously I look at your hardware products after getting it safe to cloud data services? Thanks. George Kurian : On the benefits of NAND price declines, we\u2019ve seen a little bit. I think, you will see the mix shift from hybrid flash to all-flash, right? We have said that as the prices went up, we saw a mix shift towards hybrid disk/flash system. You\u2019re starting to see the early reversal of that trend back in the all-flash arrays. And I think, over the next few quarters, there\u2019s no question that we see all-flash arrays become a bigger part of our mix. With regards to the CDS buyers, there are customers that have got our cloud data services in one cloud provider that are looking to now expand it to another cloud provider as a multi-cloud strategy. There are also customers that have started out with workloads in the public cloud that are coming back to an on-premises environment as a complement, right? So we have seen a range of competitive displacements where we start the dialogue with the customer in the public cloud for used cases like DevOps and ER, that then come back and buy a complementary production environment in their primary data center. So we\u2019re seeing both multi-cloud, as well as on-premise extensions, and we\u2019re excited at the prospect of using CDS to drive our overall portfolio. Ananda Baruah : Do you think George that can become a \u2013 can become material over time that sort of reference pipeline there? George Kurian : We\u2019ve said that CDS itself would, in our long-term guide, we said that it would be between $400 million to $600 million on an annual recurring run rate by the end of fiscal 2021, right? So that in if \u2013 in and of itself is a material add to our portfolio. This year, we said it contributes an incremental 100 basis points. I think that in terms of its strategic value to customers, it is reflective of the fact that we outperforming virtually everybody and virtually every segment we compete in. This idea of a hybrid cloud Data Fabric list all of the pieces of our portfolio in competitive situations. Kris Newton : Thank you, Ananda. Ananda Baruah : Thanks so much. Kris Newton : Next question, please? Operator : Next question is from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. Nehal Chokshi : Yes. Thank you and congratulations on great results. That sounds like that was a really massive ELA. Is that \u2013 previously that was the biggest ELAs signed in NetApp\u2019s history? Ron Pasek : Nehal, it was actually several. That was more than just one. There were probably half a dozen in that number, which is why it\u2019s difficult to predict. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. And what were the products that were included within that ELA other than the operating systems SKU? George Kurian : It\u2019s standardizing on our operating system and software. It\u2019s a broad range of offerings. Everything in our portfolio could be bought against that ELA as part of consumption of capacity. So these are strategic agreements to standardize on our Data Fabric. You typically recognize the software component upfront, and there\u2019s a commitment to buying forward capacity and customers consume that capacity over time. So it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re excited, These agreements lift all the elements of our portfolio going forward. Nehal Chokshi : And that $20 million in run rate in cloud data services, how \u2013 what percent of that came from the ELAs? George Kurian : None. Nehal Chokshi : Great. Kris Newton : All right. Thank you so much. Next question, please? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon Leopold : Great. I first wanted to follow-up on the ELA contribution as a \u2013 just to clarify, was that a significant portion of the reason mature products were up 15% year-over-year? You\u2019ve talked a little bit about that, but just want to see if the ELA was a contributor to that? And then in terms of the bigger trending question, I wanted to see how you thought about the use cases for NVMe in that \u2013 one of your competitors talks about a much broader set and claims that most of the market has very narrow use cases. Can you talk about the opportunities and applications that you see for NVMe? Thank you. Ron Pasek : So none of the ELAs are in mature. There\u2019s really only two things in mature, which is add-on business and OEM. So all of the ELAs are in strategic. George Kurian : With regards to NVMe, it\u2019s essentially a broad range of used cases, where the customer wants really fast, meaning, very low latency for their applications. The most common ones are high-performance databases. It could be, for example, where somebody wants to go to a shared storage array, rather than using a solution like an Exadata or a database appliance, right? And so that\u2019s why we see the early opportunities to position the solution. Simon Leopold : And does that include the artificial intelligence that you were talking about? Is that sort of a classic use case? George Kurian : It could be a service that\u2019s applied to a data-intensive environment like a database or an artificial intelligence \u2013 or a data lake for machine learning. So those are some of the examples. Simon Leopold : Great. Thank you for taking my questions. Kris Newton : Thank you, Simon. Next question? Operator : The next question is from Amit Daryanani with RBC Capital Markets. Irvin Liu : Hi, this is Irvin Liu dialing in for Amit. Now that you\u2019re in the October quarter. Can you share with us any thoughts on what U.S. federal government budget flush dynamics are going to look like for you, especially given expectations for increased government IT spend in calendar 2018? George Kurian : We have modeled a fairly typical year-end budget flush for the public sector \u2013 U.S. public sector. Irvin Liu : Got it. Thanks. And just a quick follow-up then. I have another question about your hardware and software maintenance businesses. You indicated that these businesses shouldn\u2019t be a headwind for you in fiscal 2019. Any thoughts on why maintenance shouldn\u2019t be a contributor to growth, given recent product \u2013 recent quarters of product revenue strength and then you also have a net new revenue stream such as cloud data services coming online? Ron Pasek : Yes. Irvin, just to be clear, we indicated it would not be a headwind to growth. So it should actually be a contributor as the installed base continues to grow. We just don\u2019t guide that piece discretely. Irvin Liu : Got it. Thanks. That\u2019s all I had. Kris Newton : All right. Thank you, Irvin. Next question? Operator : Our next question is from Joe Wittine with Longbow Research. Nikolay Todorov : Hi, thanks for taking the question. This Nik Todorov on behalf of Joe. From a strategic point of view, do you see the need to have a composable architecture in your portfolio? And how would you juxtapose that the architecture, which your HCI offering, which I think has some similarities in terms of resource scaling? George Kurian : Yes. I think, there\u2019s a variety of term. I think, the customers want simplicity of their architecture and they want to be able to, at least, in our belief not to be tied into monolithic scaling of compute and storage, right, that the early vendors in HCI had. And so different people call things differently. Our solution has many of the elements of composable in it. And so we feel very good about the positioning of our solution. What we have seen with our customer wins is a reflection of the value of that particular aspect of our architecture. Nikolay Todorov : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Joe. Thank you. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi with Lake Street. Eric Martinuzzi : Yes. I want to revisit the buyback. You spent $500 million this quarter on share repurchases. Could you recap there what\u2019s the amount and timeline remaining here? Ron Pasek : So we have $3.5 billion left to go, and I\u2019m just giving no indication of the timing. As I said at the Analyst Day, I\u2019ll give you how much we repurchased on calls like this after the fact.. Eric Martinuzzi : And then as far as current share price, is this opportunistic purchases or do you have a separate amount for quarter? Ron Pasek : We\u2019re \u2013 we do opportunistic. We don\u2019t do any accelerated share repurchase. We tend to take advantage of dislocations. Eric Martinuzzi : Okay. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, Eric. Next question. Operator : Our next question is from Rob Cihra with Guggenheim Partners. Robert Cihra : Hi, thanks very much. Just wondering with flash prices starting to decline again, are you seeing or perhaps what you think your customers are going to do in terms of like elasticity of demand? I mean, do you expect people to buy more capacity now at the \u2013 for the same dollar amount or same capacity at a lower price? Just wondering how you maybe expect that to play out? Thanks. George Kurian : I think they well clearly shift the mix from hybrid flash systems to all-flash systems. I think that we saw the reverse trend happen as prices went up. So it\u2019s not like people will spend less, they will just spend the project amount and buy more flash as opposed to disc to consume that budget. Robert Cihra : Okay. But do you think the amount of capacity of flash they buy, does that change, or do you think it\u2019s there, like are they looking for a particular capacity of flash, or a dollar amount of flash, I\u2019m just curious if that helps better? George Kurian : They \u2013 at least, based on what we saw last year, we saw people have a dollar amount and then buy the capacity associated with that. So they would buy x percentage of flash and y percentage of disk. I think that x was smaller last year than it would be this year. And it will be \u2013 y will be smaller this year than it was last year. So we saw what customers had a project budget and they would spend it and they would optimize the ratio between flash and disk and we see that going in favor of flash for the next several years now. Robert Cihra : Great, great. Great answer. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Rob. Next question? Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from Erik Suppiger with JMP Securities. Erik Suppiger : Yes. Just staying on the flash pricing theme, can you just comment how much pricing has come down in terms of your sale price? And how much you think that could still come down? George Kurian : We don\u2019t communicate exactly how and when we pass through savings to customers. As I\u2019ve said, we were the first to raise prices in the market and we are not going to be the first to lower prices in the market. We have a differentiated offering and we are looking to maximize the value that we get for our offering. We have done so in the gross margin trajectory on product gross margin this quarter, and you\u2019ll continue to see us stay disciplined on it. I\u2019m not suggesting that we will never lower the price. But I\u2019m suggesting that we\u2019re not going to be the first to do so. And we monitor the competitive landscape. We monitor what other people are selling, and we\u2019ll make the right choices at the right time. Erik Suppiger : Do you reduce pricing when you see others that are discounting more aggressively or what prompts you to make the change? George Kurian : Every deal can be competitive. We will make the right tradeoffs between whether we see this to be a strategic account that we want to capture versus whether this is a broad-based market shift. And it\u2019s called market and comparative intelligence that we are highly disciplined about. We have a very good read on the market. We have a lot of customer interactions that give us that information right. And so, as I said, we have a clear interest in extracting as much value for our technology as we can. And that value is embedded in the performance and the software capabilities of our systems. And so we\u2019ll be judicious about how we pass through savings to customers. Yes, commodity saving, the philosophy has been that we pass it through, but we can time how we do that. Erik Suppiger : Very good. Thank you. Kris Newton : All right. Thank you, Erik. I\u2019ll pass it back to George now for some final remarks. George Kurian : Thanks, Kris. We delivered a very strong start to the year and introduced substantial innovation across our portfolio, expanding our industry-leading cloud data services and introducing new partnerships, products and solutions to help data-driven organizations thrive. With our compelling Q1 results and expectations for the remainder of the year, we are off to a strong start in delivering against the long-term model we laid out at our Analyst Day last April. We raised fiscal year 2019 guidance for gross margin, operating margin and earnings per share. We maintain our expectations of mid single-digit revenue growth before any benefit from ELAs, and we continue our strong commitment to shareholder return, evidenced by the 500 million of share repurchases in Q1. We will introduce more exciting innovations at our Insight User Conference in Las Vegas in October. We will be hosting technology sessions for the investment community with NetApp executives and we hope to see you there. Thank you very much. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect, and have a wonderful day.",

Welcome to NetApp\u2019s Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2019 Financial Results Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. I will now turn the call over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Kris Newton : Thank you for joining us on our Q2 fiscal year 2019 earnings call. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Ron Pasek. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com. As a reminder, we adopted the new accounting standard ASC 606 in Q1. Our historical financial results have been restated to conform to the new accounting revenue recognition rules. Reconciliations of our previously reported GAAP results to the restated 606 GAAP results as well as our 606 GAAP to non-GAAP results are included in our Q2 earnings release for the applicable periods, which is posted on our website along with our financial tables and guidance, a historical supplemental data table, and the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation. Unless otherwise noted, we will refer to Non-GAAP and 606 numbers. During today\u2019s call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2019, our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns, and our ability to grow and expand our opportunities, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons, including global political, macroeconomic and market conditions and our ability to expand our total available market, introduce and deliver new and differentiated products and services without disruption, manage our gross profit margins, capitalize on our market position in cloud strategy, maintain execution, and continue our capital allocation strategy. Please also refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC and available on our website, specifically our most recent Form 10-K for fiscal year 2018 and our current reports on Form 8-K. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to George. George Kurian : Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We delivered another quarter of solid results. Our Q2 revenue was in line with the expectations. Gross margin, operating margin and EPS were all above the high end of our guidance range. Our consistent and strong performance reflects the clear differentiation of our technology and the strength of our business model, as well as our customers' commitment to NetApp and the significance of our Data Fabric strategy. In the quarter, we extended our leadership position by introducing new partnerships and substantial innovation across our entire portfolio. Our opportunity is framed by the data-driven digital transformation of business and defined by major technology transitions, led by cloud, IoT and artificial intelligence. The adoption of hybrid multi-cloud environments is changing how modern IT infrastructures are built and consumed, and NetApp is at the heart of these transitions. The NetApp Data Fabric provides unique customer value through an easily implemented catalogue of consistent data services, seamlessly connecting on-premises resources to the private and public cloud with unified data services, across all environments. This capability enables customers to realize the full potential of their data across edge, core and multiple clouds. Enterprises are responding to our Data Fabric strategy and are signaling their long-term confidence in NetApp by making investments in our software. As discussed on our Q1 call, we have seen a rising interest in Enterprise License Agreements or ELAs, a form of broad enterprise agreement. The ELA represents the software-based capacity enablement portion of a multiyear engagement and creates the framework for committed follow-on revenue in the form of system and support services. Demand for these agreements is driven by our largest customers and is evidence of our growing importance to their IT strategy. In September, we announced a global strategic partnership with Lenovo, designed to expand our market reach deeper into China, as well as to address server led purchases and SME and commercial segments not traditionally served by NetApp. The partnership also extends the reach of the Data Fabric strategy and capabilities into these new markets. NetApp is driving the market transition to flash as we have customers modernize, simplify and consolidate their infrastructure. We are displacing competitors\u2019 complex equipment, gaining share in new workload deployments and upgrading our installed base with cloud-connected all-flash solutions. In Q2, our all-flash array business inclusive of all-flash FAS, EF and SolidFire products and services grew 29% year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run rate of $2.2 billion. Validating the innovation leadership and momentum of this part of our business, Gartner for the third year in a row recognized NetApp as a leader in its Magic Quadrant for Solid-State Arrays. In Q2, we introduced new innovations that further expand our leadership in the all-flash array market. ONTAP 9.5 software delivers leading cloud integration, the highest all-flash performance, and greater efficiency and simplicity. This release furthers our SAN capabilities with improved performance supported by the industry\u2019s first latency guaranty to accelerate critical workloads with industry-leading end-to-end NVMe capabilities. At the start of Q2, we announced ONTAP AI in partnership with NVIDIA, which creates a seamless data pipeline across edge, core and cloud for deep learning deployments. Over the course of the quarter, we extended our participation in the rapidly growing area of AI with the announcement of MAX Data. MAX Data is the industry\u2019s first solution to leverage persistent memory in servers to deliver ultralow latency with flash-like capacity, accelerating the performance of application level data, and enabling faster processing of data for AI applications in memory databases and real-time data analytics. In addition to helping customers deliver better business outcomes with AI, we enable them to harness the growing data sources created by the Internet of Things. The latest version of NetApp\u2019s StorageGRID, flash-accelerated object storage delivers low latency performance for the billions of small objects generated by IoT devices and cloud conductivity for best-in-class performance and data management capabilities together with object storage economics. Enterprises choose our converged and hyper-converged solutions to accelerate their digital transformations because we help manage applications, infrastructure, and data as one integrated resource across private, public and hybrid cloud environment. In Q2, we enhanced the ease of managing FlexPod environment with NetApp Solution Support for FlexPod and Converged System Advisor software to reduce time to resolution for service incidents. We also enhanced NetApp HCI, our industry-leading hybrid cloud infrastructure. We announced new Element software capabilities for HCI and SolidFire, including the ability to replicate from Element to Cloud Volumes ONTAP for disaster recovery, data migration, and remote backup to public cloud as well as to on-premises ONTAP systems. Additionally, we introduced new options in our HCI portfolio, including support for GPU-based compute nodes to accelerate VDI environments and support for Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. Through tight integration with the Data Fabric only NetApp can bring the capabilities, architecture and experience of public cloud to enterprise private cloud. We are delivering on the tier 2 unmet promise of hyper-convergence by enabling customers to run multiple applications with predictable performance and efficient scalability, and our architectural approach is clearly proving out. We are seeing strong momentum in NetApp HCI with significant wins against all of our competitors. As you\u2019ve heard me say many times, our unique differentiator is cloud integration. Our entire portfolio is made stronger by the Data Fabric and our ability to support hybrid multi-cloud environment. A great example of the value of this integration is the cloud tiering service introduced in Q2. Cloud tiering identifies infrequently used data in on-premises storage and automatically and seamlessly moves it to lower cost object storage in the cloud, freeing up space on high-performance data center systems for frequently used data. When the cloud tier data is needed again, the service automatically and seamlessly moves it back to the high-performance tier. Also, in Q2, we announced substantial innovation to address distinct customer challenges in using public cloud, container orchestration, cloud infrastructure monitoring and management, data compliance and security, and backup. Immediately following our acquisition of StackPointCloud in September, we launched NetApp Kubernetes Service, which dramatically simplifies the deployment of a Kubernetes cluster and applications to public and private cloud. We also announced Trident, an open source project which supports the entire NetApp storage portfolio. The combination of NKS and Trident enables application developers to consume high-performance storage to build and deploy stateful applications on all of the world\u2019s leading cloud and on their private clouds. To help customers monitor and cost optimize the hybrid cloud infrastructures, we introduced Cloud Insights, a hybrid, multi-cloud, infrastructure, monitoring and management service. Cloud Insights quickly inventories resources, identifies interdependencies, and assembles the topology of public cloud and on premises environment. By giving organizations a view into their complete hybrid infrastructure, it helps to reduce cloud infrastructure cost by an average of 33%, proactively identify and prevent failures and improve end-user satisfaction. Fiscal \u201819 is a foundational year for the SaaS part of our business. We are focused on operational readiness and deployment in the primary cloud data centers. While early, the customer response to and demand for these offerings is exciting and reinforces our confidence in our cloud strategy. Based on Q2, our annualized monthly recurring cloud data services revenue is approximately $27 million, up 35% from Q1. We remain intensely focused on disciplined execution to meet the evolving needs of our growing customer base and to reshape our industry. We are transforming our business to reflect the way customers want to use and consume our technology. We have repositioned the Company, expanded our portfolio, and focused our execution to win the key market transition. We are serving customers in new ways with focused initiatives that help them jumpstart their digital transformation, leveraging the innovation of the biggest cloud providers in the world, building enterprise hybrid cloud, and modernizing legacy infrastructure. Our strategy is working because our customers know that we are aligned with their IT imperatives and their needs to unlock the value of their data to improve business outcomes. We heard that clearly at our recent Insight user conference where thousands of customers and partners shared their excitement for our solution and our Data Fabric strategy, and our performance has been very strong as a result. We are leading in the areas that represent the biggest opportunities for NetApp. As we continue to grow and transform, we will maintain our focus on operational efficiency, execution and shareholder value. As you can see by our strong results and capital return, we are on track to deliver against the compelling long-term model and capital allocation plan we laid out at our last Analyst Day. Before turning it over to Ron, I'd like to especially thank the customers who spoke on our behalf at Insight. Together with the NetApp team and our partners, we are delivering exceptional results and pushing the boundaries of what it means to be data-driven. Ron? Ron Pasek : Thanks, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. Our Q2 results reflect continued strategic importance of NetApp to our customers as they undertake digital transformations and embrace hybrid , multi-cloud architectures. As George noted, we expect continued progress throughout fiscal 2019 towards the long-term business model we laid out at our analyst day. Before discussing guidance, I will provide detail on our performance in the second quarter. Net revenues of $1.52 billion grew 7% year-over-year, driven by product revenue of $913 million which increased 11% year-over-year. Product revenue reflected the strength of our all-flash array business and expanding traction in our HCI platform as well as roughly a $20 million benefit from ELAs. Moving down the P&L. Software maintenance and hardware maintenance revenue of $539 million increased 2% year-over-year, driven by continued growth in our installed base and to a lesser extent, our cloud data services business. Gross margin was 65% and above the high end of our guidance range. Product gross margin of 54% increased 1.5 points year-over-year, reflecting continued sales force discipline, the benefit from ELAs and some one-time items. Excluding ELAs, product margin was approximately 53%. The combination of software and hardware maintenance and other services gross margin increased 1 point year-over-year. Operating expenses of $649 million were in line with our expectations and increased 1% year-over-year. We remain committed to strong OpEx discipline and continue to expect operating expenses for fiscal 2019 to be roughly flat year-over-year. Operating margin was 22%. Excluding ELAs, operating margin was approximately 21% and at the high end of our guided range. During the quarter, we repurchased 6.9 million shares at an average price of $81.41 per share for a total of $561 million. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 264 million, down 5 million sequentially and 11 million year-on-year. EPS of $1.06, increased 33% year-over-year, demonstrating the operating leverage in our business model. We closed Q2 with $4.3 billion in cash and short-term investments. Similar to Q1, we again saw healthy growth in deferred and finance unearned services revenue, which increased 5% year-over-year. During the quarter, we paid out $102 million in cash dividend. Our fiscal Q3 cash dividend of $0.40 per share is payable on January 23rd. Our cash conversion cycle of negative 19 days improved 9 days year-over-year, reflecting a 12-day increase in days payable outstanding and a 4-day decrease in days inventory outstanding, partially offset by a 7-day increase in DSO. 5 days of the DSO increase was due to one of our large distributors choosing to not take advantage of our early pay discount. Cash flow from operations was $165 million. Free cash flow of $122 million represented 8% of revenue. Q2 is typically the lowest cash flow quarter of the year. In addition to seasonality and one of our U.S. distributors not taking advantage of the early pay discount, we also had our first payment for transition taxes associated with U.S. tax reform, which we expect to pay annually each year in Q2 for the next seven years. It is also worth highlighting that we had a particularly tough year-over-year free cash flow comparison as we delivered an 18-day sequential improvement in our cash conversion cycle in Q2 of last year. In total, we remain confident in driving free cash flow of 19% to 21% of revenues for the full fiscal year. Now onto guidance. We are keeping a keen eye on changes in the macro backdrop, including increased volatility as a result of interest rates, currency headwinds and trade disputes with China. That said, we continue to focus on execution and managing variables within our control and we remain confident in both our fiscal FY19 guidance and our long-term three-year growth forecast for revenue and profitability. To add clarity, we are providing an estimate for the magnitude of ELAs going forward. We expect ELAs to represent roughly 2% of total annual revenue for fiscal \u201819 and future years. It\u2019s worth highlighting that the 2% in revenue from ELAs only represents the software capacity license portion of the contract. As George noted, each contract also carries a specified amount of future hardware systems revenue along with both software and hardware maintenance. To reiterate, we remain confident in our mid single digit fiscal 2019 revenue growth forecast plus any benefit from ELAs. Now to Q3. We expect net revenues to range between $1.55 billion and $1.65 billion, which at the midpoint, implies a 4% increase year-over-year, including 1 point of currency headwinds. Consistent with normal seasonal sequential decline in gross margin from Q2 to Q3 associated with product revenue being a larger portion of the overall revenue mix, we expect Q3 consolidated gross margin to range between 62.5% and 63.5%. We expect fiscal Q3 operating margins to be approximately 22%. We expect earnings per share for the third quarter to range between $1.12 to $1.18 per share. In summary, I am confident regarding our growth opportunities, especially as it relates to our compelling Data Fabric strategy. Additionally, I am very pleased with both the disciplined execution and the continued innovation momentum delivered by our team in Q2. We are well-positioned to continue to deliver on the commitments we\u2019ve made to our shareholders, partners and customers. With that, I\u2019ll hand it back to Chris to open the call for Q&A. Kris? Kris Newton : We\u2019ll now open the call for Q&A. Please be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to one question, so we can get to as many people as possible. Thanks for your cooperation. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Rod Hall : Yes. Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. So, I heard Ron, you say that 1 point of currency headwinds to the guidance. And I\u2019m wondering if you could just comment on the currency impact of the current quarter as well from a margin point of view. And then, also, I was hoping maybe that you guys could talk a little bit about the cloud services. I mean, the run rate looks pretty good, but obviously, it\u2019s not really general GA yet. How does that pipeline look? Can you give us any more color on that. Just how do you expect that revenue to flow as we look out into the next quarter and beyond? And I mean, if you could say, what you're guiding or kind of what the level of guidance is like for those cloud services that would be really interesting? Thanks. Ron Pasek : Rod, the first part of your question, as it relates to the guide for Q2, currency had very little impact on the guidance for Q2. And as I said, it\u2019s about 1 point headwind for the Q3 guide. We saw a little of that -- you\u2019d see a little bit of that in margin in Q3 as well but it\u2019s factored in the guidance there. That\u2019s one of the reasons it\u2019s down sequentially. George Kurian : With regard to cloud data services, we\u2019re in the build out phase within the hyperscale data centers. I think the pipeline has been good. We are certainly seeing the success of our software called Cloud Volumes ONTAP. Within the hyperscale marketplaces, it is a big chunk of the progress in terms of the revenue to-date of cloud data services. So, as the cloud volumes service, targeting application developers comes on line through the course of this fiscal year, we should be in a really good position to expand that sort of bookings. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Andrew Nowinski : Just a question on the gross margin. So, if we exclude your ELAs this quarter, it looks like your product gross margin was actually up sequentially from last quarter, but your fiscal Q3 and your \u201819 guidance does suggest it goes down pretty significantly from here. Given the decline in NAND prices, I was just wondering if you could maybe discuss the puts and takes on the margin guidance. Thanks. Ron Pasek : So, we typically see a pattern, as you saw last year and the year before where we go down in margin from Q2 to Q3. The biggest factor in the past years and including this year, has been just the weighting of product revenue which is higher than Q3 than Q2 to services revenue. That\u2019s the biggest part of the change. We also will have in Q3 lower ELA revenue this year. And there were some onetime benefits I referred to in Q2. But, it is a normal seasonal pattern you see. I will add if you look at product margins for the last six from Q1 of \u201818 to the quarter we reported, without ELAs, it goes from 49.5 up to 53. So, we are making product progress on the product margin for the Company. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Katy Huberty : Just a clarification and then a question. On the clarification side, does the January quarter guidance include any assumption around ELA revenue? And if not, just any color as to whether your pipeline would suggest that you might have some ELA deals? And then, for a question AFA run rate growth of 29% was a slowdown. Can you just talk about whether that deceleration was slower systems growth or was it entirely driven by lower NAND prices flowing through to ASPs? Ron Pasek : Katy, the first part of your question, I tried to balance ELAs for the full year this year of 2% of revenues. And just to recall, we did about 90 million in Q1 and 20 million in Q2. So, pretty much there to the full-year forecast for ELAs. We might see little bit -- so the forecast assumes -- it\u2019s just a forecast. It might be a little bit but it\u2019s not going to be a lot. George Kurian : With regard to the all-flash arrays, I think first of all, we are growing 29% year-on-year. The predominant percentage of that was due to shipments. We have not adjusted prices to deal with NAND. So, as we\u2019ve said, we\u2019re going to monitor what other people do and then make the appropriate adjustments. Katy Huberty : And George, why do you think shipment growth slowed in the quarter? George Kurian : I think, there is a mix between flash and hybrid flash. I think, the percentage of our business that\u2019s today all-flash arrays is very large. And if you look at it sequentially, in Q1, we had some benefit from ELAs for all-flash arrays. As you saw, in Q1, our number was a very large number year-on-year. So, I think, it\u2019s just more of a sequential compare against the one time set of metrics in Q1. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Aaron Rakers : Yes. I wanted to go to the last question that was asked and kind of understand maybe what you're seeing from a competitive landscape perspective in the all-flash market? And as we start to -- or as you guys evaluate what some of the competitors are doing, how you see the potential playing out for demand elasticity as it relates to your installed base opportunity that's not yet upgraded to flash, maybe metrics around that would be helpful as well. George Kurian : I think from an installed base perspective, we still have a very small percentage of our installed base on all-flash arrays, it\u2019s in the mid teens. So, there is plenty of headroom. I think that we are going to balance the ability to upgrade the installed base with the -- getting the best for our offering. We think that our offerings are very competitive in the market, and we are going to try to extract the maximum value for that. I think in terms of competition, we don't see any fundamental change in the competitive landscape. I think that we are seeing more new competitors as we attack the hyper-converged market. So, we are expanding our competitive assault on hyper-converged market, and we are seeing as a result of that some newer players. But, no fundamental change in the competitive dynamics. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Your line is now open. Steven Fox : Just one question for me. George, you mentioned traction on the HCI side, I was wondering if you can expand on that and talk about where you're seeing that and what do you expect for the rest of the year, fiscal year from HCI? George Kurian : We\u2019re very pleased with the progress on hyper-converged. I think as we\u2019ve said, we have a differentiated architecture that\u2019s resonating in the marketplace. We saw a broadening book of business and accelerating pipeline, and a growing number of competitive wins. So, it proves out the thesis that we\u2019ve had all along that the enterprises want a solution that enables hybrid cloud infrastructure that allows IT to operate like a service provider, that allows applications infrastructure and data to be seamlessly managed whether it\u2019s on-premises or across multiple clouds. And so, our strategy is working. We\u2019ve got work to do to continue to expand the scaling of our go-to-market pathways and to expand the number of price points that we need to address. But, we\u2019re very-very pleased with where we are year-to-date. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Wamsi Mohan : I had a quick clarification as well on the product gross margins, Ron. You mentioned some one-time benefits a few times. And I was wondering if you could call out what those were and what the magnitude of that was. And George, can you comment on the broader spend environment, both in the enterprise and hyperscale players? And any color by region would be helpful. It sounds like your guidance is gated by some caution there. Ron Pasek : So, Wamsi, the one-time benefits relate to some reserves and it was about 0.5-point but not material but just something to be aware of. George Kurian : With regard to our -- the macro, no particular color that I want to share. I think we just -- we saw some movement in some of our U.S. public sector deals where there were in quarter command programs, these are multi-year programs that are not tied to any particular budget cycle that just has spending come out in Q3 as opposed to in Q2. So, we feel very good about our ability to capture that business in Q3. And then, overall, I think, nothing unique that we want to comment on. I think you see the public markets, reflecting some stress in some parts of the emerging markets. I think, that's really the summary of the comments. Operator : Next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with Susquehanna. Your line is now open. David Ryzhik : Thanks so much for taking the question. This is David Ryzhik for Mehdi. Ron, would you be able to give us some insight into just product revenue, growth expectations embedded in the Jan quarter and for the balance of \u201819? And then within that would love to get your sense of how material Lenovo relationship can be, and would that be included in strategic or would that be in mature revenue? Ron Pasek : So, David, we don\u2019t guide below the total revenue number. We\u2019ll talk about revenue after the fact and compare year-over-year but I don't guide that specific guidance. George Kurian : With regard to Lenovo, Lenovo has started to be in market with our products. They bring complementary pathways to the customer, they allow us to access new decision makers. We are starting to see the first wins, but it\u2019ll take us good amount of time to get them fully scaled, in terms of their -- all of their geographies and knowing our products taking into market. There is a very little overlap in our customers base, which is positive. There is a reasonable amount of common channel partners, but there is work to be done. And in terms of strategic versus mature, we\u2019re no longer going to be using that breakout of the business the majority of the mature business is now add-on storage, reflecting the strategic product sales. So, you\u2019ll see us just comment about product revenue and services revenue on a go forward basis. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is now open. Ananda Baruah : A quick clarification to one question. George, clarification. So, just as a regard to spending environment, is it take away that you\u2019re not really seeing anything material yet, you want to leave it at that for right now? And then, I have a quick follow-up as well. George Kurian : I think with regard to spending environment, there is no particular impact of tariffs that we saw, it\u2019s too early to comment. I think, we\u2019re just generally cautious trying to maintain our track record of providing clear guidance and meeting or beating it. I don\u2019t think there is anything that you should read into the commentary that is less in confidence or have specific color around the economic outlook. We\u2019re monitoring it, there is a lot of news but we haven\u2019t seen specific items change in terms of their trajectory. Ananda Baruah : Just a question is coming out of the user conference what was sort of the vibe coming out to user conference? What were some of the common themes from users? There seem to be -- I mean, there is a lot of participants there this year. The energy was great, people were talking about putting new projects. What were the common themes coming out that you guys saw. George Kurian : We were very excited by the number of net new customers that were at the conference, reflecting our ability to grow footprint into new parts of the market that were historically not NetApp customers. We were excited at the number of customers that validated our solutions and our direction for hybrid multi-cloud IT as their path going forward. And of course, there was an extraordinary amount of innovation that we delivered at our Insight conference. And it leads us to continue to have really, really good confidence that we\u2019re gaining share in the markets that we\u2019re competing it, expanding our addressable markets through new solutions, like hyper-converged solutions, solutions for artificial intelligence, and changing the industry landscape through the unique combination of applications, infrastructure and data for hybrid multi-cloud IT. So, we feel really good about where we\u2019re positioned and look forward to finishing out the year strongly. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Joe Wittine with Longbow Research. Your line is now open. Joe Wittine : Hey, guys. Nice numbers, especially given the competition out there. George, I wanted to do a quick follow-on to your prior HCI comments. We also picked upon some acceleration this quarter, including what seemed to be some nice size wins against players that I would consider to be higher end, traditional reference architecture type converged solutions. So, is it fair to say you\u2019re seeing interest with HCI in the field now for a while in either more advanced customers or more mission critical applications than you envisioned at launch? George Kurian : Absolutely. Our belief was that we are building on the only architecture that was designed to operate a multitenant service provider class HCI offering. And by bringing back to the enterprise, we are uniquely advantaged versus other players that started from a small office dedicated appliance. And that is proving out clearly in Q2 and in our go forward pipeline. So, people are excited about our offering. I think as we integrate it more tightly into our hybrid multi-cloud Data Fabric, it both locks out players trying to enter our installed base as also allows as to capture a bigger footprint, like you said in the enterprise data centers that we don\u2019t have footprints in it. So, we are really, -- our thesis on the HCI market that it was time for disruption with a mainstream enterprise grade offering, like in the all-flash arrays, absolutely playing out. We can't be more excited looking forward. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Simon Leopold : During your Insight event, you talked about multi-cloud and in your prepared remarks we heard it a lot again. And it\u2019s definitely an intriguing narrative, and it feels like an inflection point. I think I'm struggling to figure out how to attach this to our forecasting. And maybe broadly, do you look at the emergence of multi-cloud as an element that can lead to reacceleration of year-over-year growth, or is it just basically just replacing older technology, so is it sort of a natural evolution or an accelerating factor? George Kurian : Multi-cloud plays into our business in multiple ways. The first is, it allows us to access completely cloud native customers that do not have a data center. I think at Insight you saw, it's a customer of that type called WuXi NextCODE, which is a genomics company that is built on the cloud, never had a data center. The second is it allows us to expand our footprint within existing customers where the combination of cloud plus data center gives us unique benefit. Those could be net new customers, like we are displacing people who have legacy data centers with our flash technology combined with cloud, or it could be expanding footprints within existing customers where we displaced one of our competitors in the SAN market with the cloud flash alternative. And then the third is, it allows us to bring more efficiency to our existing customers, in some cases where they want to for example, leverage the cloud for analytics, a footprint that we historically didn\u2019t serve. So, there's a lots of avenues. I think that it's already helping us in leadership in flash where the cloud brings a unique angle to our flash solutions that others do not have. And then from a pure cloud solutions standpoint, you will see that reflected in the CDS business on a go forward basis. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kurtz with KeyBanc. Your line is now open. Alex Kurtz : George, at the outset of the call here you mentioned that it sounds like the top line was more in line with expectations versus beating on the margins. Is there different verticals or regions that outperformed or underperformed, any kind of additional clarity on kind of how the quarter played out would be helpful? George Kurian : I think, U.S. public sector was a little bit soft relative to our expectations. APAC and U.S. commercial conversely were very strong. EMEA dealt with a point of ForEx being as a headwind. So, most of the theaters did really well. On U.S. public sector, as I mentioned in my comments, we have a broad book of business. Some aspects of that business are tied to multi-year programs. And the trajectory of spend within a specific quarter can vary. They\u2019re not tied to the typical year-end, federal spending pattern. And so, we saw some of those programs move spending from Q2 to Q3. So, we feel good about our ability to capture that business in Q3. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Erik Suppiger with JMP. Your line is now open. Erik Suppiger : Could you compare the prospects for your multi-cloud with your HCI solution? I presume the multi-cloud is further along in terms of contribution. But, can you talk about what you think -- how you compare the two different prospects there? George Kurian : Multi cloud is -- will inherently become a part of what most hyper-converged solutions will have to offer. If you think about an IT department, most of them will want to have the ability to build their own clouds, or manage the portfolio of applications and say, hey I don\u2019t want to run those in my own data centers, I just want to use the public cloud. We are clearly uniquely positioned in the public cloud marketplace for having the ability to connect applications, infrastructure using NetApp Kubernetes service and data using a technology called Trident that we have to make multi-cloud, hybrid multi-cloud deployable today across all the major cloud providers. When we combine that with hyper-converged, you now not only get to do that on the public cloud but also on-prem. And we do that in a way that is unique because unlike some of the other hyper-converged vendors, we\u2019re allowing you to use the public cloud services. All the other hyper-converged vendors have some form of walled garden they\u2019re building in the public cloud that doesn\u2019t give you the benefits of real public cloud. So, we\u2019re excited you\u2019ll see that play out and we\u2019re just going to keep our head down and prove that out. We think we've got a really strong start the first half of the year in hyper-converged. Lookout out, here we come. Erik Suppiger : And then, secondly, any comments about NVMe, did you see any more adoption during the course of the quarter? George Kurian : NVMe has two flavors, one is the any connection between discs and storage systems; that\u2019s nice but not massively differentiated. We have it. We\u2019ve seen customers adopted as they adopt NVMe drive. So, we\u2019re pleased it\u2019s in line with expectations. NVMe over Fabrics which is the truly  strategic part of the NVMe roadmap is now deployed at a few customers. It\u2019s early, it\u2019s applicable for truly low latency application, and we\u2019re excited. We\u2019re pioneering that part of the market and we\u2019re excited at both the support that we have from the ecosystem as well as customer interest. But, it\u2019ll take time to adopt, like any new storage protocol. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Eric Martinuzzi with Lake Street. Your line is now open. Eric Martinuzzi : A question on playing with the potential new bigger player in cloud. NetApp plays well with Amazon and Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. Given the IBM acquisition of Red Hat, which is expected to close in the second half of 2019, I\u2019m interested to hear your thoughts on what this means for enterprise hybrid storage environment? And then secondly, from a product development, wondering if there's any initiatives that NetApp is entertaining to maybe benefit from that pending merger acquisition. George Kurian : Just a couple of things. I think the first is, the acquisition or planned acquisition of Red Hat by IBM is yet another endorsement of hybrid multi-cloud. Right? I think that combination of Red Hat together with IBM gives enterprises the ability to deploy multiple clouds and hybrid cloud. We already have strong relationships with both sides of that transaction. With Red Hat, we have done a lot of work across multiple solutions, both standalone storage, converged systems and hyper-converged systems to support OpenShift as well as a verity of other Red Hat Enterprise Linux platform combinations. We just announced this quarter the ability to deploy OpenShift alongside NetApp HCI. And then with IBM, we have a longstanding relationship with IBM cloud, all the way from the time of SoftLayer. They are a large NetApp partner, we have hybrid cloud solutions alongside the IBM Cloud where you can deploy Cloud ONTAP Volumes on the IBM Cloud and there is a verity of innovation going on together with them as well. So, we feel that this is a good combination. It affords us yet another player to work with to make hybrid multi-cloud reality for customers. Eric Martinuzzi : Understand. So, more of a opportunity that you guys are already well positioned for than something you need to design new product for? George Kurian : That\u2019s correct. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citi. Your line is now open. Jim Suva : A question about the past 12 to 24 months memory pricing has been a headwind. Can you remind us what you did historically during that time period? And I think on your conference call, you mentioned you\u2019ll assess going forward, what the competitive landscape does. So, hypothetically, what does that mean, if memory prices keep coming lower, will you lower your prices, will you mirror the percent change? How should we think about that? And is it a lagging basis or just-in-time basis or how should we think about? Just the future impact of memory prices versus the past history of 12 to 24 months? Ron Pasek : So, Jim, if you remember, about 18 months ago, we did in fact increase list prices for products that carried NAND, and that was simply because that was what our experience was with the supply base. We were very fortunate to be able to secure supply that entire time, and in fact knew that the pricing would eventually come down starting earlier this year and it in fact did. As we said a number of times, we\u2019re not going to be the leaders in reducing list prices, now that NAND prices are coming down, we\u2019re going to watch it and see what happens. On a net price basis, we\u2019re still very competitive. So, we\u2019re watching that effect too. So, it\u2019s what you do with list prices and then what you do with street price. So, we are going to keep watching as we go forward. George Kurian : We also continue to make investments in software that allows us to maximize the value that a customer gets from a piece of memory. And we announced at NetApp Insight the availability of ONTAP 9.5 that has further advancements in our already industry-leading storage efficiency technology. The second is, I think as flash prices come down, it makes all-flash arrays where we are extraordinarily well-positioned, a more and more meaningful opportunity for a broader and broader mix of workloads within our customers. And so, as that capitalizes replatforming opportunities in the customer base, it\u2019s clearly an opportunity for us that we are going to take advantage of. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. Your line is open. Nehal Chokshi : So, results and guidance are definitely within the guidance parameters that you provided previously as well as your analyst day. However, when I exclude the impact of ELAs, I do see a slowdown in the year-over-year product growth, albeit still within your long-term model. So, I think from 11% year-over-year in the July quarter, and now it's around 9% year-over-year for this quarter, your guidance implies that\u2019s probably going to be around 5% year-over-year. So, is there a narrative that we need to be concerned about as far as why we are seeing this product revenue growth slowdown albeit still within the guidance? Ron Pasek : I think what we have been doing is we\u2019ve got services business to total back to where it\u2019s not a headwind. That was what we were seeing last year, some of that product growth was making up for the headwind we had on the services side. I think as you look the second half of last year, we grew the Q3 quarter 9% year-over-year in total and Q4 11% that\u2019s total revenue growth. Product growth within that was quite a bit higher. So, we are looking at some pretty tough compares. We did guide the year to mid single digits, we are very confident we can still do that. And that\u2019s without the benefit of ELAs. George Kurian : I think, the only other additional comment that I would add was last year in some parts of the world, ForEx was a tailwind; this year, it\u2019s a headwind. I think that we feel very, very good about our innovation portfolio. If you look at it this time last year, we were strong in flash but not yet at meaningful progress on the other two alternatives, which hyper-converged and public cloud. I think this year, heading into the second half of this year, we feel very good about flash where we feel much more -- we can have much more line of sight into the strength of our hyper-converged and public cloud business. So, overall, we are focused on execution. We have good start to the fiscal year. We remain committed to our outlook, which was to grow mid single digits without ELAs for the year. And so we are going to execute to that plan. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rob Cihra with Guggenheim. Your line is now open. Rob Cihra : Just a question on your flash versus hybrid mix. so AFA obviously growing rapidly, but obviously not 100% of your revenue. So, with that other -- whatever, call it half of your business that that's hybrid or drive based, are you seeing that sort of selling into the installed base as add-or that sort of thing or do you see enough genuine applications, sort of cold storage, Hadoop, whatever where those hybrid platforms are actually still best. And so, there's some mix where -- it\u2019s not like you\u2019re ever going to get to 100% flash? I hope that question makes sense. George Kurian : Yes. I think if you look at the hybrid arrays, there\u2019re two forms of hybrid arrays, one is where you\u2019ve got a piece of solid state storage front ending SaaS drives, meaning performance drives; the second is a form of hybrid array where you\u2019ve got flash front ending capacity drive, meaning 7,200 RPM capacity drive. There\u2019s still some percentage of our business in the former of the two categories, which will eventually get replaced by all-flash arrays. As the price point of NAND gets better over the next year, there\u2019s going to be an enduring portion of our business for capacity oriented workloads, for sequential workloads, for example video which don\u2019t benefit from solid state where the second form of hybrid array will continue to be an ongoing percentage of our business for as long as I can see. Operator : And I am showing there are no further questions. So with that I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to NetApp for closing remarks. End of Q&A: Kris Newton : Great, thank you. George Kurian : I am really excited about the opportunity ahead. We introduced a tremendous amount of innovation in Q2 that helps us drive share gains, expand our available market, and set the industry agenda. NetApp is uniquely able to help customers solve the challenges of multi hybrid cloud environment, with the Data Fabric. Our Data Fabric strategy is paying off through growing importance to our customers, and yielding strong financial results. We are relentlessly focused on execution and on delivering against our plan. And we remain confident in both our fiscal \u201819 guidance and our long-term two-year growth forecast for revenue and profitability. I look forward to talking with you again next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we\u2019ll conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. I will now turn the call over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Kris Newton : Thank you for joining us on our Q3 fiscal year 2019 earnings call. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Ron Pasek. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com. As a reminder, we adopted the new accounting standard ASC 606 in Q1. Our historical financial results have been restated to conform to the new revenue recognition rules. Reconciliations of our previously reported GAAP results to the restated 606 GAAP results as well as our 606 GAAP to non-GAAP results are included in our Q3 earnings release for the applicable periods, which is posted on our website, along with our financial tables and guidance, a historical supplemental data table, and the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation. Unless otherwise noted, we will refer to non-GAAP and 606 numbers. During today\u2019s call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2019, our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns, and our ability to grow and expand our opportunities and address the key market transition, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially from our statements and projections for a variety of reasons, including global political, macroeconomic and market conditions and our ability to expand our total available market, introduce and deliver new and differentiated products and services without disruption, manage our gross profit margins, capitalize on our market position in cloud strategy, maintain execution, and continue our capital allocation strategy. Please also refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC and available on our website, specifically our most recent Form 10-K for fiscal year 2018 and our current reports on Form 8-K. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to George. George Kurian : Thank you, Kris, and thanks to everyone joining us today. In the face of an uncertain macroeconomic environment, we focused on the variables within our control and delivered a strong third quarter. Although I\u2019m disappointed with revenue being at the low-end of expectations, our operational discipline delivered gross margin, operating margin and EPS that were above the high-end of our guidance ranges. Regardless of the demand headwinds, we remain well positioned for the long-term, as we address the growth areas of the market and provide an efficiency in our business. I\u2019d like to address the challenges we saw in Q3 head on. The macroeconomic environment is outside of our control, but I remain exceptionally confident about our strategic position and operational focus to deliver profitable growth and shareholder value. After a normal close to the calendar year, we saw slowdown in purchasing across the Board in January, driven by deteriorating outlooks for the global economy, as well as uncertainty around trade policy. In the face of these headwinds, our largest customers became more cautious in their purchasing behavior and sought more information on the implications for their businesses of slowing economies. We did not see any real change in the competitive environment. Our wind rates stay constant and our pipeline remains healthy. Our customers\u2019 purchasing decision continue to be based on our features, capabilities and future-proofed cloud integration strategy. Even in the face of softening demand, we were able to further expand product margins in the third quarter by focusing on the value our solutions bring in addressing customers\u2019 largest IT imperatives. Like any company, we do not have perfect visibility into all the reasons for purchasing slowdown. However, we are deeply involved in the strategic planning and purchasing process of our large customers and have good visibility into how they deploy us and where we fit into their IT strategy. We remain tightly engaged with them, and as such are confident that we have the right product set and the right go-to-market strategy to continue capturing a greater share of our customers\u2019 IT wallet. Our unique customer value is reinforced by digital transformation initiative, which are fueling data center modernization projects and cloud-first strategy to succeed in the data-driven digital economy and radically improved business performance, customers need to accelerate digital innovation, generate real-time insights and secure access to their data across multiple clouds and on-premises. This requirement for hybrid multi-cloud capabilities is creating three significant market transitions : disk to flash, traditional IT to private cloud and on-premises infrastructure to hybrid clouds. It is in these key strategic battlegrounds that we have substantial opportunity to exploit the advantages created by the NetApp Data Fabric and take share. We are driving the market transition from disk to flash, as we help customers modernize, simplify and improve application performance. We are displacing competitors\u2019 complex equipment, gaining share in new workload deployments and upgrading our installed base with cloud-connected all-flash solutions. In Q3, our all-flash array business inclusive of all-flash FAS, EF and SolidFire products and services grew 19% year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run rate of $2.4 billion. We are over-indexed in the large and growing all-flash market with a significantly higher all-flash array share than in the total storage market. Our advantage here will continue, as the market shifts to flash, and we expect that shift to accelerate with ongoing NAND price declines. All-flash arrays carry a higher ASP, which benefits not only product revenue, but also recurring services revenue, with only 15% of our installed base currently running all-flash arrays. The runway for this secular transition remains in the early innings. The second major market transition we\u2019re exploiting is the shift from traditional IT to private cloud. SolidFire and NetApp ACI are the building blocks for private cloud deployments, enabling customers to bring public cloud-like experience and economics into their data centers. In the third quarter, we announced new validated and proven architectures that simplify the design, deployment and support of on-demand services and applications, as well as support hybrid cloud workflows with an on-premises S3-compatible object storage. Customers are embracing our unique value that couples extreme ease of use with enterprise scalability and quality of service. And as a result, the momentum in our private cloud business that began in the October quarter accelerated in Q3. The shift from on-premises infrastructure to hybrid clouds is the third key market transition that we are taking advantage of to expand our business. Only NetApp is building a comprehensive set of cloud data services available across multiple clouds. We help customers extend on-premises environments to the cloud, deploy enterprise workloads in the cloud and build and refactor primary workloads for the cloud, with tools to optimize hybrid cloud workloads and cost. Based on the last month of Q3, our cloud data services annualized recurring revenue is approximately $33 million, up 22% from Q2. As we said before, this is a foundational year for our cloud data services, during which we are focusing on operational readiness and deployment with the hyperscalers. We are excited by the feedback that we are receiving from the growing number of customers who are in controlled production with us. While still in early phases, we are well-positioned for when these services soon become broadly available, roughly two-thirds of early cloud volume service customers are new to NetApp. This, coupled with the strong customer interest we are experiencing, gives us tremendous confidence in the potential of this part of our business. In closing, we are confident in our position for long-term success. We are a leader in the large all-flash array market. We are seeing accelerating momentum with our private cloud solutions and our public cloud solutions are positioned to deliver strong growth in FY 2020. We are playing into the big market transitions from a position of strength. Flash and cloud integration enables us to protect and expand the installed base of our core ONTAP business. Our private and public cloud solutions enable us to reach new buyers. Our flash, hybrid cloud infrastructure and AI solutions are serving as pillars of customers\u2019 new architectures, and we are seeing adoption of our cloud offerings as part of our customers\u2019 foundation for moving applications and data to the cloud. These factors, combined give us confidence in our ability to reaccelerate growth, as customers become more comfortable with the external environment. We have demonstrated discipline in managing the business and we\u2019ll continue with the keen focus on the factors within our control. We are paying close attention to execution, to maximize our opportunity in an uncertain macro. We again expanded gross margin and increased profitability in the quarter, despite the slight moderation in customer buying behavior. I would like to thank the NetApp team for their commitment to a high-level of discipline, execution and customer focus. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Ron to walk through our Q3 financial performance and go-forward expectations. Ron Pasek : Thanks, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I\u2019ll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. As George highlighted in Q3, we delivered strong margins and operating leverage in the face of caution from our customers around the macro environment. This is a solid testament to the strength of our underlying business model. Despite the market uncertainty, we are confident in our product leadership and strategy to reaccelerate growth going forward, and we remain sharply focused on execution and managing the variables within our control. Consistent with our commitment to shareholders, we again improved gross margin, operating margin and delivered outstanding free cash flow. In Q3, despite a slower demand environment experienced in January, net revenues of $1.56 billion were within our guided range and grew 2% year-over-year, including about a point of currency headwind. Product revenue of $967 million increased 2% year-over-year, reflecting our shift to all-flash arrays and growing traction in our private cloud solutions, offset by about 150 basis points of currency headwinds. There were no ELAs in the quarter. Moving down the P&L. Software maintenance and hardware maintenance revenue of $531 million increased 2% year-over-year, driven by our continued growth in our installed base and to a lesser extent, our cloud data services business. Gross margin of 63.7% was above the high-end of our guided range. As expected, we saw the normal seasonal sequential decline in product margin from Q2 to Q3. Product gross margin came in at 52.6%, which is an increase of about 100 basis points year-on-year, reflecting continued sales force discipline in the face of macroeconomic uncertainty and about 50 basis points of currency headwinds. This was the eighth straight quarter, we increased product margins year-over-year. The combination of software and hardware maintenance and other services gross margin of 81.7% increased about 50 basis points year-over-year. Operating expenses of $629 million were down 2% year-over-year coming in lighter than anticipated, largely due to lower variable compensation. We remain committed to strong OpEx discipline and continue to expect operating expenses for fiscal 2019 to be roughly flat year-over-year. Operating margin of 23.5% came in solidly above the high-end guidance and represented a new company record. EPS of $1.20 was above the high-end of our guided range and increased 14% year-over-year. We closed Q3 with $4 billion in cash and short term investments. Similar to Q2, we again saw healthy growth in deferred and financed unearned services revenue, which increased 7% year-over-year and was up $151 million sequentially. Deferred revenue growth continues to be a strong leading indicator of the health of our installed base. Our cash conversion cycle remained extremely healthy at a negative 11 days, which is roughly flat year-over-year. Cash flow from operations was $451 million. Free cash flow of $420 million represented 27% of revenues, while year-to-date free cash flows of $804 million represents 18% of revenues. Q4 has historically proven to be a strong seasonal period for free cash flow conversion, as such we remain committed to driving free cash flow of 19% to 21% of revenues for the full fiscal year. Our confidence in our long-term vision and execution is reflected in our capital allocation strategy. During Q3, we purchased 8.1 million shares at an average price of $67.84 per share for a total of $550 million. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were $255 million, down $21 million year-on-year, representing an 8% decline. We have $2.4 billion remaining on our current share repurchase authorization and will continue to be aggressive given NetApp\u2019s free cash flow yield and return on invested capital profile. During the quarter, we paid out $99 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $649 million to shareholders, representing 155% of free cash flow generated in the quarter. Now on to guidance. Customer caution around the macro backdrop has heightened, as we entered the new calendar year. As a result, we expect Q4 net revenues to range between $1.59 billion and $1.69 billion, which at the midpoint implies flat revenues year-over-year. It is worth noting that our Q4 revenue guidance includes 200 basis points of currency headwind and is off a very challenging Q4 2018 compare, where we grew total revenue by 11% year-over-year. Consistent with the normal seasonal sequential decline in gross margin from Q3 to Q4 associated with product revenue being a larger portion of the overall revenue mix, we expect Q4 consolidated gross margin to range between 62% and 63%. We expect Q4 operating margin to be between 23% and 23.5%. We expect earnings per share for the fourth quarter to range between $1.22 and $1.28 per share. The midpoint of our Q4 revenue guidance implies total fiscal 2019 revenue growth of 4.6%. Our Q4 guidance also implies fiscal 2019 gross margin of 64.3%, operating margin of 22.7% and EPS growth of 28%. As we look out to FY 2020 and beyond, I\u2019m confident in our ability to reaccelerate growth and deliver on our long-term profitability targets. We remain diligently focused on both disciplined execution and continued innovation. In the phase of a slower demand environment, our business model leverage and the secular tailwinds created by the three key market transitions : flash, private cloud and cloud data services, will enable us to continue to deliver on the commitments we\u2019ve made to shareholders, partners and customers. With that, I\u2019ll hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris? Kris Newton : We\u2019ll now open the call for Q&A. Please be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to one question, so we can get to as many people as possible. Thanks for your cooperation. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Andrew Nowinski : Okay, thanks a lot. Thanks for the question. Maybe I\u2019ll just ask some question as it relates to kind of your guidance that you gave at Analyst Day regarding fiscal 2020 and 2021. I\u2019m curious just given the result that we saw today in your guidance for Q4, would you say, you\u2019re still expecting to deliver at least 2% earnings growth over the next two years? And then also on the revenue, is that mid single-digit still valid? George Kurian : Hi, Andy, yes, that is our plan and you\u2019re seeing in FY 2019, we\u2019re going to do well above that. And yes, our long-term guidance is still at the mid single digits on the top line absolutely. Andrew Nowinski : All right. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Andy. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Partly, Rod Hall, please check your mute button. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Matt Sheerin : Yes. Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. Just relative to the weakness that you are seeing from your large enterprise customers, it look like your direct business was down 12% year-on-year, that was the first time and I think six quarter, you were down. And \u2013 but your channel business was up mid single digits. What do you think the difference is in terms of the tone of smaller customers versus large customers, because if you look at all the channel partners that have reported, they all talked about fairly strong growth and still good outlook for this year? George Kurian : Our largest customers are the ones that we serve through a direct pathway. The broad range of customers are served through a channel model. The largest customers are the one that are most affected by some of the uncertainty, both economic and political uncertainty around the globe and we saw incremental caution in their buying behavior in January. Ron Pasek : Matt, the other thing that\u2019s a little misleading just to factor in is, in Q1, Q2, we did have ELAs, which show up in direct revenue. So they skewed the direct number a little bit higher. If you adjust for that, we\u2019re always within the last, say, eight quarters, 2018. And again, that\u2019s where the demand if fulfilled, not necessarily where it\u2019s created. Matt Sheerin : Okay. And in terms of the ELAs, you didn\u2019t have any revenue. You\u2019ve had some good revenue there in the last few quarters. Is that more of a timing issue and related to the weakness that you\u2019re seeing from your large customers? George Kurian : No, there\u2019s nothing to do with that. Nothing at all. It\u2019s just \u2013 as we said, when we first started talking about ELAs, they tend to be difficult to predict and lumpy. And there weren\u2019t any we had in the quarter or anticipated to have. Matt Sheerin : Okay. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Matt. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Rod, please go ahead. Kris Newton : Let\u2019s move on to the next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Wamsi Mohan : Yes, thank you. Ron, can you talk about the gross profit at a product level. If you could bridge that sequentially from last quarter to this quarter the 150 bps sequentially? And given the revenue deceleration that you have seen, do you think that you can hold the 50% product gross margin over the next year or so, especially when the competitive environment becomes a little tougher with around the mid range storage product launches that are anticipated to happen later in the year? George Kurian : Yes. Thanks, Wamsi. Yes, I mean, if you look at the last eight quarters, we\u2019ve grown product margins each of the last eight quarter year-over-year, and our intent is still to do that. The target we gave you was 55% to 56% and we still plan to do that. The bridge from Q2 to Q3 on the product side, remember, this is a always a seasonal thing happens with the public sector quarter being Q2, and then typically we have a fall off in that business. So that\u2019s very traditional we saw that each of the last five years. So we had some of that seasonality affects over the headwind and then we had no ELAs in the quarter. We had them the last quarter, and then that\u2019s offset with some benefit from NAND pricing. Wamsi Mohan : Okay, great. And, George, just a quick clarification for you. I think you noted that elasticity of demand could sort of kick in, given these NAND prices. Is there typically three to six-month lag, but you expect to see this elasticity of demand with the macro environment sort of clouding, maybe the elasticity of demand from kicking in faster? George Kurian : We think that over time, as NAND prices continue to decline that customers will shift the mix of their business from disk-based systems to flash-based systems. We saw good acceleration in our flash system counts through the course of the quarter. We saw some incremental caution in terms of how much capacity customers were buying, which could be correlated to buying or today\u2019s needs as apposed to building out for their entire future requirement. So we saw a little bit of that. It \u2013 it\u2019s reflective a bit to the macro environment. We believe that as NAND prices continue to move favorably, it gives us an opportunity. We are well positioned in the flash market. We have strong differentiation with software, which has allowed us to preserve and even grow gross margins. And if you look at the ASPs of a flash-based system as opposed to a disk-based system, they are actually higher. So we think that\u2019s a good trend for us to capitalize on. Wamsi Mohan : Okay. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Wamsi. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Thank you for taking the quick questions. First of all, could you just help us understand, I mean, the rate of deceleration that you saw during the month of January? And as you thought about the guidance for this third quarter, your assumptions on how maybe February pointed out and how \u2013 what assumptions you are making relative to what you saw in January as far as any kind of improvement? And I have a quick follow-up. George Kurian : I would say that, we felt very good about where we were within the quarter sort of heading into the Christmas holiday, and things changed materially through the last week of December and really January. I think that we did not see any change in the competitive dynamic win rates or any of those aspects. We just saw an increased amount of scrutiny in terms of spending within our customers them requiring more approvals and just buying for today as opposed to buying the full scope of what we plan to buy with us. I think that with regard to some of our largest customers, the global customers that are exposed to geographies around the world, as well as to public sector, there will be time before they come back to their normal course of spending, right? Some of that is related to sort of clarity on how their business is impacted, and some of that like in public sector is, it takes time to get the work force back into normal operating cadence, which is reflective of our caution in Q4 Aaron Rakers : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then on the NAND pricing front, can you just help us understand what rate of declines you\u2019re currently seeing on the flash side? And how you would characterize your ability to hold flash pricing in the market? Ron Pasek : The price declines we\u2019re seeing are not perfectly linear. They continue to go down. I think what we \u2013 you\u2019ve got to remember is, the storage industry in our company\u2019s history is predicated on decreasing commodity pricing. So, in many ways, as stores sort of earlier catalyzes demand for new use cases and drives the never-ending appetite for increasing data consumption. So it\u2019s something we\u2019re predicting, that\u2019s why we have a \u2013 over rotation on flash. We know that that\u2019s the growth area. Price reductions help that growth. As George said, you see the elasticity between the different types of media. And so as NAND prices come down, more workloads move to all-flash. George Kurian : And we\u2019re seeing that. If you look at system counts and capacity counts through the course of this fiscal year, they have been both up quite substantially. I think what we noted this quarter, especially in January was a little bit of a step back in caution around capacity. System counts continue to be really good. Aaron Rakers : Okay. Thank you very much. Kris Newton : Thank you, Aaron. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is now open. Ananda Baruah : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question, I appreciate. Hey, George, on \u2013 any greater context you could provide on what your large customers are using as signpost? I mean, you mentioned, George, I think in the prepared remarks, if they\u2019re looking at their end business? And then just a quick follow-up to that. Do you have any sense, if they are pausing on how broad is a pausing on new implementations or the milking \u2013 not milking, but in a sort of raising capacity on the product \u2013 on existing project. You mentioned that they might be adding less capacity on new projects like that, I would just love anymore context around those two things? Thanks. George Kurian : I think it\u2019s too early to draw broad conclusions. I would say that January represents the new budget cycle for a lot of our customers. And as they get their planning in place, I think they took a little bit longer this year than typical because of the certainty. I think we saw the transformational projects that have multi-quarter implementations continue apace. I think in the next new projects, I think, people were probably a little bit more cautious, waiting for clarity in terms of how their business rolled out. I would say, in terms of our book of business, all of the strategic areas of focus for us all-flash arrays, private cloud and our cloud data services, we feel good about our progress across all of those dimensions. there it really reflects the strategic aspect of our discussion with customers and we feel good about the progress in all of those dimensions. Ron Pasek : Just keep in mind, even if you isolate Q3, it\u2019s really \u2013 we were up 2% from midpoint. And if you look at the full-year based on the midpoint in Q4 guide, we\u2019re off maybe a little over almost 2 point in the full-year. So in the scope of the greater scheme of things, we\u2019re still pretty much on exactly what we thought from mid single digits. Ananda Baruah : That\u2019s great. Thanks for the context. Kris Newton : Thanks, Ananda. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Katy Huberty : Yes, thanks for the question. Ron, for you one gross margin guidance. If I look back at the last two fourth quarters, total company gross margins were actually up a little bit sequentially despite the fact that the lower-margin product business was growing very fast, and you didn\u2019t have as much help from NAND. So can you just talk through why here you think total company gross margins are down sequentially? Ron Pasek : So, Kath, I think the better compare is really year-over-year, and I think that\u2019s a more meaningful compare. And then remember, what we typically see sequentially is and you see this from Q1 to Q2 to Q2 to Q3 generally and Q3 to Q4. The higher weight of product margin and product revenue which grows \u2013 this is a slightly lower margin than the services margin, so that always puts pressure. That\u2019s a mix issue that we see all the time. Katy Huberty : Okay. And then just George, just as a follow-up. I think a year ago, you talked about exiting this fiscal year with, perhaps\u2026 Kris Newton : I think, we lost Katy. Katy Huberty : Sorry, sorry. Just a follow- up for George, at about a year ago, you talked about exiting this year with $6 million of cloud services revenue. And it looks like you\u2019re tracking a little bit below that. Why do you think that is, or is that not the right way to think about it? Thanks. George Kurian : We are in the foundational year of our cloud data services business. I would say, we are a bit behind where we expected to be in terms of the operational readiness of our service offerings with our cloud providers. We are, as we said, generally available with AWS. We are in controlled pilot production projects with both Azure and Google, and we expect them to be available eminently. I would say that we are probably 0.5 basis point towards below where we guided for the full-year revenue, but we are excited that the results that we\u2019re seeing. It confirms all of our expectations in terms of differentiation. We have broadened the range of use cases and workloads that we serve. And so as soon as we get to generally available with these cloud providers, we feel very good about our ability to inflect the business and return the accelerate that. In terms of our long-term model for cloud data services, we\u2019re not backing off the projections we had. As Ron mentioned, we feel confident about our long-term model for the whole business, as well as for our cloud data services. Katy Huberty : Thank you, George. Kris Newton : Thank you, Katy. Next question? Operator : The next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Your line is now open. Steven Fox : Hi, good afternoon Just one other question on the slowdown you saw in January. Is there \u2013 could you isolate it to what verticals maybe were more \u2013 will you sort more in terms of the slowdown, or geographic regions? And given we\u2019re talking about longer-term start-up projects, like what would you say would be the extended decision timeline versus what you previously thought for these things closing or it\u2019s starting to ramp its pacing originally anticipated? George Kurian : I would say that one of the areas that we talked about as having some decisions pushed out was in U.S. public sector, where we said in Q2, some decisions pushed out. We saw the recapture of preponderant majority of those decisions in Q3, and we were able to move those projects forward. With regard to the broader macro, I don\u2019t think there were any specific industry trends that we noticed. I think that clearly, those industries with specific exposure to China and public sector were incrementally more cautious. But I think there weren\u2019t any other specific trends that we could draw out. With regard to the U.S. public sector, as we said earlier on the call, we think that it will take sometime for the government to get back to full fledged operations. And so we don\u2019t have perfect visibility into how projects shape out through the course of the coming quarter, so we\u2019re being incrementally cautious there. Steven Fox : Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, Steve. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is now open. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes, thank you. One question for George. How do you see the replacement cycle for 10-k RPM playing out for the remainder of 2019. Is it going to be more of late in the year, or should we think of this cycle kicking in next year? And for Ron, how \u2013 I know this is a little bit far out. But as we look into fiscal year 2020, how aggressive are you going to be in managing your OpEx? George Kurian : I think, let me take the 10-K RPM drive question. I think there\u2019s still work to be done to get a viable solution to replace some of the capacity points that 10-K drives were focused on. If you notice, the majority of the 10-K drives that are still being deployed are actually lower capacity points than some of the TLC NAND solutions that are available in the market at comparable effective dollar per gigabyte price points. So, you can see some customers that say, listen, \u201cI want to strategically move to all-flash for its benefits that increasingly start to look at that as an option. But I think for the full transformation to happen, you will need quad layer cell or the next sort of capacity price point in the NAND cycle, and we\u2019re working on that, but it will take sometime. Ron Pasek : So, Mehdi, on your OpEx question, it\u2019s a little early for that. But I\u2019ll remind you what we said at Analyst Day last April. So I guided this year to be roughly flat in OpEx and actually next year as well. But remember, we\u2019re still actively doing a ton of transformation, so we\u2019re still doing a lot of investment and a lot of disinvestments. So it\u2019s not as if we\u2019re just staying flat, not doing anything. We\u2019re really working and getting a lot more efficient. George Kurian : In terms of just to underscore that point, we have made all of these bets into the new parts of the market, private cloud, all-flash arrays, cloud data services and new pathways to market, while simultaneously improving operating margins to a record. This quarter, operating margins the highest \u2013 being the highest in the company\u2019s history, right? So we will continue to stay disciplined on the operating expense side of the business, but we\u2019re not going to forego strategic opportunities for short-term gain. I think we have maintained discipline and you\u2019ll see us continue to invest into the future opportunities, while being prudent about overall spend. Mehdi Hosseini : Thanks, guys. Kris Newton : Thanks, Mehdi. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kurtz with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Alex Kurtz : Yes. Thanks for taking the questions, guys. George, just on hyperconverged, I know this has been a big area of investment for the company over the last couple of years. I know it\u2019s still kind of working its way through the channel and with the sales organization if we\u2019re looking to fiscal 2020. Are you prepared at this point to provide kind of a run rate that you think is reasonable or a percentage of product revenue, or just serve the contribution to the overall product side of the business, that would be helpful to understand? George Kurian : Our overall private cloud business, meaning, SolidFire deployed standalone or as part of a hyper-converged model. For large customers, they deploy standalone for smaller and mid-market customers they deployed as hyper-converged, as well as object storage, which are deploying for cloud native applications in a private cloud form or a substantial contributor to NetApp\u2019s revenue this quarter. I\u2019m not prepared at this point to break it out. But I can tell you that, they performed in a really good pattern across customer accounts, revenue contribution, units, you name it, we guide it. And we think that as we look forward to fiscal 2020, it gives us a really strong second leg foundation to our growth, right? So we\u2019re already a leader in the al-flash array market. We are seeing accelerating and materially accelerating momentum in the private cloud game. So stay tuned. We\u2019ll tell you more as we headed to fiscal 2020. Alex Kurtz : All right. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, Alex. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Tim Long with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Tim Long : Thank you. Ron, you talked a little bit about the installed base when referring to the software, hardware maintenance and services. Just give us \u2013 if you can just give us a little more color there. It was up a little bit year-over-year. It looks like was down a little bit sequentially, so is there a seasonal pattern there as well? And when do you think we could expect to see that line with a little bit more sustainable growth? Is it dependent on just all-flash array being a bigger piece of the overall base or cloud data services or what do you think will help move that line to higher more sustainably? Thank you. Ron Pasek : Yes. So as we talked about, we continue to grow system counts in the installed base. And remember, up until two years ago, we had 13 quarters of sequential decline in a row on the product side. So we\u2019ve really got to get back to 13 quarters of year-over-year increases in installed base to really get back to where that you\u2019ll see that grow again. So we\u2019re probably several quarters away from that. We don\u2019t \u2013 as you know, we don\u2019t guide that discretely, Tim. So even though, we\u2019ll give guidance on the next call for FY 2020, I won\u2019t guide it specifically. I\u2019ll give some general color, though. Tim Long : Okay. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, Tim. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Simon Leopold : Great. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about what\u2019s happening in your competitive environment? And to what degree your growth is driven by your customer base upgrading their base of NetApp platforms versus to what degree are you dependent on basically taking footprint from others in the marketplace? Thank you. George Kurian : We did not see any change in the competitive dynamic through the quarter. I would say that when you look at our all-flash array business, it is expanding wallet that we used to not have within our traditional enterprise customers, as well as through our cloud solutions, both private cloud and certainly public cloud solutions, we are expanding to net new customers. I\u2019ll simply give you some data, which says that, of all of our cloud customers that we are engaged with either through the hyperscalers or through our own cloud software offerings, two-thirds of them are net new to NetApp. So they\u2019re opening up new relationships and new logos for us to acquire. So we did not see any fundamental change within the competitive landscape. We think that as the market transitions from disk base to flash-based systems, given that we are a leader in all-flash with a substantially higher market share percentage than we are in disk, there are a lot of weak large players in disk-based systems that we will take share from : IBM, Hitachi, Fujitsu, Oracle, HP, there\u2019s a lot of them. And even Dell has a challenged mid-range portfolio and IM portfolio. So we feel good about our opportunities. We\u2019ve got to execute to capture them. Simon Leopold : Thank you for taking the question. Kris Newton : Thank you, Simon. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Ader with William Blair. Your line is now open. Jason Ader : Yes. Thank you. George, Cisco just reported, and they didn\u2019t see the macro issues that you guys apparently did. So I\u2019m just wondering how do you explain that number one? And number two, do you think there might be something else going on in terms of maybe NAND pricing causing some customers to delay just because they want to see where prices go in the market? George Kurian : We did not \u2013 I can\u2019t comment on what Cisco saw or not, so I would leave that to Chuck to comment. I think with regard to our business, what I can tell you is, we maintain discounting through the end of the quarter. So it\u2019s not a matter of hey, if you offered a lower price, customers would step forward and transact. I would tell you based on being involved deeply in many of these transactions, we saw an increased level of scrutiny on transactions, where you would have to get more purchasing approvals or provide for greater explanation of ROI or business case or things like that. And so I would just tell you that, if it were as easy as providing a discount to deal with forward price NAND contract, we have the vehicles to do that and we would have applied those. Jason Ader : Okay. And then one quick follow-up for you, George. Just on AWS reinvent this year, Andy Jassy spent like a half-an-hour talking about Amazon\u2019s new file-based storage offerings. And I was just wondering what impact you think that might have on your offering through AWS? George Kurian : We continue to see really good uptake of our cloud volume software through AWS. And so I\u2019m sure he has his own offerings, but that hasn\u2019t had any impact on NetApp. Jason Ader : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, Jason. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. George Iwanyc : Thank you for taking my question. George, Europe looked \u2013 behaved a little bit differently, it look relatively strong. Can you give us an idea of what\u2019s happening there? And then I have just a quick follow-up as well. George Kurian : It was really good execution by European team. We are the leader in all-flash arrays. In many parts of the European market, we have deep strategic relationship with customers. There is volatility in the European political landscape. We did see some GDP changes. We\u2019re being cautious about the overall environment, but I just want to say that our team executed well and stayed in control of the business till the end. George Iwanyc : Okay. And can you give us an update on your Lenovo partnership? I mean, if that\u2019s helping in China? George Kurian : It\u2019s too early to comment about the success of the partnership. We are in the market. We are seeing wins that are additive to the NetApp footprint. It\u2019s too early for me to categorize them in terms of size or color except that, listen, this is additive to NetApp. I think with regard to China, it gives us a pathway into that market that is isolated from some of the trade tensions. The NetApp team finished the \u2013 their \u2013 the NetApp quarter well and executed well, and I want to thank them for that. And we\u2019re looking forward to the joint venture getting off the ground soon enough, and we\u2019ll keep you posted as the news of that and the operational readiness comes online. So we feel like, the China approach that we have is positioned well to endorse all of the challenges that might exist between the geopolitical \u2013 in the geopolitical relationship, and it allows us to focus from a branded channel perspective on the rest of the world, while Lenovo helps us with their enormous resources in China. Stay tuned. George Iwanyc : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, George. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Coster with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Paul Coster : Thanks for taking my question. The macro uncertainty that you saw in January, that was manifested in the flat changing behavior of your large customers. Was that also true of the cloud service providers either as partners or even as customs? George Kurian : We don\u2019t \u2013 the three major hyperscalers, meaning, Amazon, Google and Microsoft, do not buy hardware from us. They work with us where we deliver a service through their data centers to customers. So they\u2019re more like a partner. We saw no evidence of them backing off. In fact, the range of used cases and the deployments that we have with them are widening rather than narrowing. What \u2013 there are other cloud service providers who we sell to and sort of not the superjumbo hyperscalers. And across them, there was a variety of puts and takes. I think many of them are being careful to prioritize the investments around their best opportunities, for example, 5G wireless, right. So I would just say, they\u2019re going through one of these evaluation of priorities process and so we did see some changes in that mix. Paul Coster : Okay. And then the other sort of big factor of things happening, of course, is more and more workloads and data is being pushed through the edge. Are you seeing any manifestation of that through your business? George Kurian : Yes, we are pleased by the growth of the used cases that we are deploying in the edge. So we have software-defined solution that are part of ruggedized environments that are deployed at the edge in industrial and public sector use cases. We saw good traction. We saw good traction with our objects storage portfolio, providing a private cloud for certain advanced telemetry use cases in autonomous driving. We saw good adoption early, but still good adoption of some of our AI solutions to crunch the data that it generated at the edge and brought back to the core. So we remain optimistic that our solution portfolio is good and differentiated. And the number of growth engines we have, as the macro stabilizes, is certainly broadening from even a year ago. Paul Coster : Okay. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, Paul. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citi. Your line is now open. Jim Suva : Thanks very much. George, I think, you\u2019ve been very clear about the demand environment and a lot of questions on that. So maybe I\u2019ll switch the question over to Ron. Ron, in the past few quarters, there were several ELAs that came up, and then NAND this quarter. I think some people were thinking that ELAs might just kind of be a normal course of doing business. So with none this quarter, is the normal course of doing business is one or two a quarter kind of not really how it\u2019s going to turn out, or were there a couple of customers who signed ELAs and just other people don\u2019t want that, or how \u2013 any type of behavior change on just kind of the topic of ELAs or just simply is it lumpy and we shouldn\u2019t expect it to be one per quarter or something like that? Ron Pasek : Yes, it\u2019s a good question. Last quarter, I mentioned it\u2019s hard to anticipate when they\u2019re going to land. So I gave a full-year view this year and the next year as you should expect roughly 2% of revenues as ELAs. It is lumpy. They\u2019re hard to predict. There will be quarters when they\u2019re zero, there will be quarters when they\u2019re quite a bit more than that. So it\u2019s just a really difficult thing to predict and I can only give a full-year guide on it. It\u2019s going to make some quarters difficult compares. This quarter \u2013 this year in Q1, we had a very robust ELA quarter, that\u2019s going to be a difficult compare. Jim Suva : So that sounds like, yes. George Kurian : Hey, Jim, we did not anticipate ELAs nor did we see them. So it performed according to plan. Jim Suva : Yes. I just want to make sure there is no change in behavior. It was more just a timing of it and things like that? Ron Pasek : That\u2019s right. And remember, we did about $90 million in Q1 and about $20 million last quarter in Q2. So we really don\u2019t have much left to do to get to that full-year 2% guide. Jim Suva : Thank you so much for the clarifications. It\u2019s greatly appreciated. George Kurian : Sure. Kris Newton : Thank you, Jim. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open. Karl Ackerman : Good afternoon, George and Ron. I guess, Ron, looking at prior gross margins, excluding ELAs, with enterprise SSD prices declining roughly 20% this quarter and the next, would you expect to see massive whip higher in your product gross margins beyond April? And you continue to improve hardware and maintenance margins, certainly an impressive feat for sure. What do you think has been the biggest key contributor to that improvement in hardware and maintenance margins? And why would I be wrong to conclude that business couldn\u2019t have perhaps an eight handle on gross margin over the next few years? Thanks. Ron Pasek : Yes. So the first part of your question, I \u2013 we are seeing some benefit in total margin for NAND. But it\u2019s really more of a focused effort really over the last eight quarters, not just in the last couple of quarters. So, it\u2019s hard to anticipate what might happen, and I\u2019m not going to telegraph what I think might happen other than I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll get back to 55% or 56% eventually on product gross margins. I\u2019ve been pretty clear about that. On the hardware and maintenance margins, I think you\u2019ve got to be a little careful. We do have competitors in the space. We have to be careful what our margins are and what we charge. We need to make sure that customers feel that we can provide a quality service at a reasonable price, and and they can see those gross margins as well. So you\u2019ve got to make sure they\u2019re not ridiculous. Kris Newton : Thanks, Karl. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of the Steve Milunovich with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Steve Milunovich : Thank you. George, you talked about the importance of executing in the future. Could you talk about the evolution of your go-to-market? And one thing I\u2019ve heard is that, NetApp may not be as good as some competitors in selling to new customers, not as comfortable selling up to the CTO, the CIO, the CFO and I know that this is also part of your selling value to get that 55%, 56% product margin, so kind of an update on go-to-market? George Kurian : I think it\u2019s a place that we continue to work to improve our capabilities, right? I\u2019d say that over the last year-and-a-half, two years, we\u2019ve opened up new pathways to market, for example, with Lenovo into parts of the world that we have historically not had a lot of footprint with the hyperscalers into the top of the accounts, where big digital transformation projects are and have expanded the total addressable market as a result of solutions like our private cloud solution. We have continued to optimize our sales coverage model. So that we can align resources to go after net new accounts and net new workloads. And we believe there\u2019s substantial total available market for us to go address. And so this is an area where we have to improve and we\u2019re going to continue to try to do so every quarter. Steve Milunovich : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, Steve. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Eric Martinuzzi with Lake Street. Your line is now open. Eric Martinuzzi : Yes, question for George. The \u2013 in your prepared remarks, you talked a little bit about the installed base being such a terrific opportunity, because I think it was only 15% that gotten their purchasing the all-flash array. In some ways, that\u2019s encouraging, because it shows the wide open opportunity, but in some ways we\u2019ve heard that number, at least, I can recall hearing it several quarters now. I\u2019m just wondering what is it that\u2019s got the installed base maybe reluctant is the wrong word, but what can you do to enhance the adoption of all-flash in the installed base? George Kurian : The installed base is a very, very large number of systems. And so what \u2013 as we are growing our flash systems, we are also simultaneously growing our installed base, right? So, both numerator and denominator are growing. The things that will help capitalize the movement are really consolidation and economic projects to improve that installed base. As flash gets cheaper, it certainly makes it a more viable prospect to help customers upgrade their installed base, as some of these next-generation data center projects get underway and our customers there has opportunity to certainly improve that conversion. But it will take time just given the magnitude of that installed base. Eric Martinuzzi : Do you have any like a two to three-year horizon, where you expect that 15% could become 25% or 30%? George Kurian : I don\u2019t have any forecast at this point. I do think, it will follow the trend of our flash opportunity. And we\u2019re mindful of the fact that they are installed base is an opportunity. Kris Newton : Thank you, Eric, Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nick Todorov with Longbow Research. Your line is now open. Nikolay Todorov : Hey, guys, good afternoon. It sounds like you are rightfully cautious on the large customer side in the U.S. public sector. But I just want to understand your underlying guidance assumptions for the channel business. Are you guys as rightfully as cautious as there, or there\u2019s a little bit more optimism and to that end of the market? And overall, what is the outlook for 2019 hardware spending that you\u2019re getting from the channel business? George Kurian : We have roughly 80% of our business fulfilled through the channel, and that\u2019s the number that we break out in the categorization of our financial metrics. That number has stayed relatively stable for a very long period of time, and we don\u2019t foresee a substantial mix shift this coming quarter or next year, right? I think within that channel number, there are a set of customers that the channel fulfills for large customers and others for small. The small medium customer segment performed better this past quarter. We continue to believe they are a growth opportunity for us given our share in that market. We are more cautious about the large customers who have global businesses. Nikolay Todorov : Okay, got it. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Nick. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Rod Hall : Hi, guys, can you hear me this time? Kris Newton : We can. George Kurian : Yes. Rod Hall : Well, it\u2019s a miracle. Okay, thanks for the chance again. I wanted to zero in on the year-over-year growth rate on the revenue. I just \u2013 I\u2019m looking at the trend here back in April of 2018, it was 11% and 11.6% then 7.2%, then 1.6% in January, and then you\u2019re guiding for basically flat, maybe down just $1 million or $2 million. And so I guess, what I wanted to ask is, whether you believe this April guided quarter hit the bottom on that trend? And if you don\u2019t believe that, why not? And if you do believe it, why do you believe it\u2019s the bottom? Ron Pasek : So, I think what you\u2019ve got to remember is the guide we gave, which looks roughly flat year-over-year has 2 points of currency headwind. The 11% you mentioned last year had 2 points of currency tailwind. I would think it was \u2013 we\u2019re going to do mid single digits next year, that\u2019s the guide I can tell you right now. So I don\u2019t know how that will quarterize, but obviously, that has to be \u2013 we have to be growing from where we\u2019ll end in Q4. Rod Hall : So, Ron, you\u2019d be just saying that then the January quarter is the bottom. And if you have the 2 points back, you\u2019re kind as well, you\u2019re kind of flat lining on the growth that you saw in January and then from here, we can guess what the trajectory might be? Ron Pasek : Right. That\u2019s right. Rod Hall : Okay. Thanks for that. Kris Newton : Thanks, Rod. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. Your line is now open. Nehal Chokshi : Yes, thank you. So I think DSOs were up five days year-over-year. So presumably, that means that things were a little bit more back-end loaded than usual. Yes, you talked about how you did see a slowdown at the back-end of the quarter. So A, can you help bridge that, perhaps maybe you saw a loosening up of that demand at the end of the quarter, but not enough to make up for the shortfall at the beginning of January? Ron Pasek : Yes, Nehal, it was really hard. I mean, it was not back-end loaded. We saw kind of that demand as we talked about kind of wane in January, so that\u2019s not the issue. When I dissect the reason for the escalation DSOs, which is not significant, it\u2019s just a mix of customers that have slightly different terms than they did last year, wherever you end up with collections at the end of the quarter based on that group of customers could be different than the prior year compare or prior quarter compare. I would point out that we\u2019re still in a very negative cash conversion cycle, so I\u2019m pretty happy about that. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. And then my\u2026 Kris Newton : Go ahead, Nehal. Nehal Chokshi : Yes. George, you mentioned that you\u2019re a bit behind on the operational capability of the cloud services, which are cloud service providers. Could you delve into why it\u2019s behind? And then also there has been some management shakeups at some of these cloud service providers that create some opportunity for NetApp as well? George Kurian : Well, we\u2019ve got really good longstanding relationships with them. We are performing deep technical integration of our technology into their service delivery platform and we\u2019re going through tests to get certification, right? So we are going to be imminently available and we look forward to that. We are excited that the production pilots that we have going on with their customers. So, stay tuned. I think we have an expanding range of opportunities through those could providers. Kris Newton : All right. Well, thank you, Nehal. We appreciate it, and I\u2019ll pass it back to George for some final remarks. George Kurian : Thanks, Kris. Despite the near-term demand headwinds, cleared by the uncertain macro, we were able to beat on gross margin, operating margin and EPS. We continue our strong discipline in managing the business. As the economic uncertainty abates, we are well-positioned to reaccelerate our positive momentum by capitalizing on the key market transitions created by digital transformation. We are playing into these transitions from a position of strength. Our solutions allow us to reach new buyers, while growing our installed base. We are a leader in all-flash. The momentum in our private cloud business is accelerating. Our public cloud solutions with large hyperscalers are poised to deliver strong growth in fiscal 2020. All of this supports our confidence in our long-term model for mid single-digit top line growth. Thanks for your time. I look forward to speaking to you again next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program, and you may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. I will now turn the call over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Kris Newton : Thank you for joining us on our Q4 and fiscal year 2019 earnings call. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Ron Pasek. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com. As a reminder, we adopted the new accounting standard, ASC 606 in Q1. Our historical financial results have been restated to conform to the new revenue recognition rules. Reconciliations of our previously reported GAAP results to the restated 606 GAAP results as well as our 606 GAAP to non-GAAP results are included in our Q4 earnings release for the applicable period, which is posted on our website, along with our financial tables and guidance, a historical supplemental data table and the non-GAAP to GAAP reconciliation. Unless otherwise noted, we will refer to non-GAAP and 606 numbers. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2020. Our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns, and our ability to focus our resources to grow and expand our opportunities, and address the key market transitions, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially for a variety of reasons including global, political, macroeconomic and market conditions, and our ability to expand our total available market, introduce and deliver new and differentiated products and services without disruption, manage our gross profit margins, capitalize on our market position and cloud strategy, maintain execution and continue our capital allocation strategy. Please also refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC and available on our website, specifically, our most recent Form 10-K for fiscal year 2018 and our Current Reports on Form 8-K. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP, unless otherwise indicated. I'll now turn the call over to George. George Kurian : Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. We made significant progress across key strategic aspects of our business. This was masked by execution issues in the fourth quarter. Along with FX headwinds, these issues resulted in revenue coming at the low end of our guidance range. This is not how I'm used to showing up, and we\u2019re taking concrete actions to quickly address the issue. Our opportunity is large and growing, but we need to do more to capture it. I'll start by reviewing the areas in which we had challenges and our remediation plans and then talk about the substantial progress we\u2019ve made in our key growth areas. Our execution challenges manifested in three areas. First, we were inconsistent in our go-to-market execution. We are addressing this by improving our focus and coverage. We have efforts underway to shift investments to market and customer segments with higher return on investment. We enabled our European distributors to lead in smaller countries where they are better positioned for success, so that we could focus our resources against the largest markets. We are also increasing the number of sales resources dedicated to acquiring new enterprise accounts to broaden our customer reach. We are making trade-off decisions within the bounds of our financial models and to improve our ability to execute in our targeted growth areas. These investments take time to pay off, but we expect to see their benefits over the course of fiscal 2020. Second, we did not execute well on renewals in Q4. However, the asset count in our installed base is growing and we are making the necessary organizational and process changes to improve our execution. Finally, our OEM business has been a periodic headwind to our overall business. OEM while still a relatively small part of our revenue was down significantly in Q4. We do not expect it to recover and are resetting our expectations. OEM will be materially lower in fiscal year 2020 and will create a slight headwind to growth in the first three quarters of the year. The data center buying behavior of large customers that we saw in January continued through Q4. Customers are buying, but deals are taking longer and require greater effort to close. We have a good sense for the industry trends and are confident that these events are not the result of competitive dynamics. Our strong gross margins in the quarter are indicative of our differentiation and the value customers find in our solution. We are well positioned to the market and are taking action to capitalize in our opportunity by increasing our focus and investing in targeted sales coverage. Now, let's turn to the areas where we made solid progress. We gained share in the all-flash market growing that part of our business 25% from fiscal year 2018. We saw a strong momentum in our private cloud business delivering large enterprise wins and a number of competitive displacements. And our public cloud services are poised to deliver significant growth in fiscal year 2020 with Azure NetApp files expected to become generally available in our first fiscal quarter. In Q4, our all-flash array business inclusive of All-Flash FAS, EF and SolidFire products and services grew 11% year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run rate of $2.7 billion. I am disappointed by the performance of our all-flash array business in Q4. The issues we experienced in the quarter were felt most acutely here. This is also the place where investments in focus and sales coverage will have the earliest positive benefit, and I remain confident in our position and opportunity for continued success in this market. We have a leading efficiency guarantee, highest performance and most complete cloud integration in the industry. The runway for this secular transition is still in the early innings and we expect the shift to flash to accelerate with ongoing NAND price declines. Moving to our private cloud solutions, SolidFire, NetApp HCI and StorageGRID are the building blocks for private cloud deployments, enabling customers to bring public cloud-like experience and economics into their data centers. The momentum of our private cloud business that began in Q2 continued through the year delivering triple digit year-over-year growth in each of Q2, Q3 and Q4. Our private cloud business inclusive of SolidFire, NetApp HCI and StorageGRID products and services achieved an annualized net revenue run rate of over $600 million in the fourth quarter. These solutions are a significant contributor to our fiscal year 2020 growth expectations. Turning to cloud data services. Our NetApp cloud data services enable enterprises to deliver meaningful business outcomes quickly and cost efficiently, eliminating lengthy IT processes and complexities. Our partnerships and solutions with the hyperscalers are unique. Only NetApp offers a comprehensive set of data services available across multiple clouds. I'm honored that NetApp was named 2018 Google Cloud Technology Partner of the Year for Infrastructure at Google Cloud Next 2019 for our achievements in the Google Cloud Ecosystem helping customers build and run applications on the Google Cloud quickly and at scale. Based on the last month of Q4, our cloud data services annualized recurring revenue accelerated to approximately $51 million, up 55% sequentially from Q3. We continued to see a healthy mix of customers new to NetApp in our cloud data services and expect that they will continue to drive new customer acquisition. We remain confident in the fiscal year 2021 exit run rate revenue target we gave at our April 2018 Investor Day. And as with private cloud, this business is a significant contributor to our fiscal year 2020 growth goal. Our opportunity is fueled by digital transformation initiatives, which are driving data center modernization projects and cloud-first strategies. Each of our solution groups are highly competitive individually but the true value of NetApp is in the strength of our integrated portfolio in our data fabric strategy which radically simplifies the management of a customer\u2019s hybrid multi-cloud environment. Enterprises increasingly view NetApp as a strategic partner who can enable their digital transformations and meet their needs from the edge to the core to the cloud. Our data fabric strategy and expanding portfolio of data services is driving deeper and more strategic engagements with customers, and will ultimately lead to growth and share gains in the cloud and on-premises. In closing, I want to emphasize that we\u2019re moving quickly to do the work needed to return to growth. We are examining every aspect of our business execution, driving focus and aligning resources against the biggest strategic markets while staying within the bounds of our financial model. Throughout FY 2020, we will continue to evaluate initiatives that enable us to maximize our market opportunity. I\u2019m confident in our position as we move into fiscal year 2020. We expect to gain momentum as our investments and focus and coverage play out, we will keep you updated on the progress of these initiatives on future calls. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Ron. Ron Pasek : Thanks, George. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. Despite some of the execution issues George highlighted, we again improved gross margins and delivered strong free cash flow with continued momentum in both our cloud data services and private cloud businesses. Before discussing our full-year results and guidance, I'll provide detail on our Q4 performance. In Q4, net revenues of $1.59 billion were within our guidance range and down 3% year-over-year including over two points of currency headwind. Product revenue of $1 billion decreased approximately 2.5% year-over-year and would have been flat if not for currency headwinds. Moving down the P&L, software maintenance and hardware maintenance revenues of $526 million decreased 3% year-over-year. As George noted, we did not execute well on our maintenance renewals. However, our asset base continues to grow. Deferred revenue which was up over 9% year-over-year in Q4 continues to be the best measure of the health of our maintenance business and our customer\u2019s long-term commitment to NetApp. As a result, we expect maintenance revenues to grow in fiscal 2020. Gross margin of 65.2% was above the high-end of our guidance range and includes a 0.5 point of currency headwind. Product gross margin was 55.3% which is an increase of more than 2.5 points year-over-year. The product margin expansion was driven by continued sales force discipline, growth in our software only products and approximately $30 million of ELAs. ELAs benefited product margins by less than one point. The expansion in product margin was offset by more than a point in currency headwinds. Q4 2019 was the ninth straight quarter with increased product margins year-over-year even when adjusting for the benefit of the ELAs. Strong performance in gross margins reinforces our confidence in achieving our long-term targets provided at our Analyst Day. The combination of software and hardware maintenance and other services gross margin of 81.9% increased by 100 basis points year-over-year. Q4 operating expenses of $680 million were flat year-over-year but came in higher than anticipated largely due to variable compensation associated with product specifics sales incentives. Operating margin was 22.5%, up 50 basis points year-over-year. EPS of $1.22 was at the low end of our guidance range and increased 9% year-over-year. We closed Q4 with $3.9 billion in cash and short-term investments. Our cash conversion cycle was a positive 3 days, up 17 days year-over-year. DSO of 70 days were up 12 days as revenue shipments were usually backend loaded. The underperformance in revenue in the quarter drove DIO to 21 days, up 3-day increase. Given the transitory nature of these impacts, we expect to return to a negative cash conversion cycle in fiscal 2020. Despite the cash conversion cycle headwinds cash flow from operations was $399 million, free cash flow were $364 million represented 23% of revenues, our confidence in our ability to execute and long-term vision continues to be reflected in our capital allocation strategy, during Q4, we repurchased 7.3 million shares at an average price of $68.97 for a total of $500 million. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were $249 million down $24 million year-on-year representing a 9% decrease. We have $1.9 billion remaining on our current share repurchase authorization and we'll continue to be opportunistic given NetApp's free cash flow yield and return on invested capital profile. During the quarter, we paid out $97 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $597 million to shareholders representing a 164% of free cash flow generated in the quarter; today we also announced a 20% increase to our quarterly dividend which will now be $0.48 per share per quarter. Turning to our full-year 2019 results, Net revenues of $6.1 billion increased 4% year-over-year including one point of currency headwind. Gross margin of 65% was up 1.5 points compared to fiscal 2018 and was above our original guided range of 63% to 64%, operating margin of 22.6% improved 3 points versus fiscal 2018 and was above our original guidance of 22%. EPS of $4.52 increased 27% year-over-year demonstrating the operating leverage in our business model. Fiscal 2019 represents the third consecutive year of 25% to 35% growth in EPS. We generated free cash flow of $1.2 billion in fiscal 2019 which represented 19% of net revenues. We continued to deliver on our capital allocation strategy with $2.1 billion in share repurchases and over $400 million in dividends representing a total shareholder return of 215% of free cash flow. Over the last three years our capital allocation strategy has returned $4.4 billion to shareholders. Now on to guidance, since fiscal 2020, we expect revenues to grow at the low end of our mid-single digit range, driven by continued momentum in our private cloud business and an inflection in our cloud data services as solutions on Azure and other services become more broadly available. We also expect to reaccelerate growth in all-flash arrays. These fiscal 2020 growth drivers will be somewhat offset by a decline in our OEM business. Sequential growth within the year will be consistent with our normal seasonal patterns except for the volatility introduced by ELAs. We expect gross margin to be in the range of 64% to 65% and operating margin to be in the range of 23% to 24%. Implied in this guidance is our expectation that operating expenses will remain roughly flat year-on-year in fiscal 2020. We are committed to delivering low teens EPS growth without buybacks and expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 19.5%. Additionally, we expect to continue to generate meaningful free cash flows in the range of 19% to 21% of revenues, we managed our supply chain to minimize the impact of China tariffs and as a result we do now expect tariffs to have a material impact on our business in fiscal 2020. Please note that we will be adjusting the definition of our strategic mature product categories in fiscal Q1 as planned to better align them with how we manage our business. Now on to Q1 guidance, we expect net revenues to range between $1.315 billion and $1.465 billion which at the midpoint implies, a 6% decline in revenues year-over-year. It is worth noting that our fiscal Q1 revenue guidance includes over a point of currency headwinds with no ELAs. The Q1 2019 compare is very challenging as we grew the revenues by 12% year-over-year including $90 million in ELAs. Adjusting for currency and ELAs, our fiscal Q1 total revenue guide implies a 1% growth year-over-year. In Q1, we expect consolidated gross margins to be approximately 65% and operating margin to be between 17% and 18%. We expect earnings per share for the first quarter to range between $0.78 and $0.86 per share. To address the execution opportunities George highlighted, we conducted workforce realignments in both Q4 2019 and Q1 2020 as we continue to focus investment dollars towards the best market opportunities in key growth initiatives. The realignment charges are GAAP-only and do not affect our non-GAAP results. As we look out to fiscal 2020 and beyond, I remain confident in our ability to grow and deliver on our long term profitability targets. We have diligently focused on improved execution, our business model leverage and secular tailwinds created by market transitions to flash, private cloud and public cloud will enable us to continue to deliver on the commitments we\u2019ve made to shareholders partners and customers. With that I'll hand it back to Kris to open the call up for Q&A, Kris? Kris Newton : We'll now open the call for Q&A. Please be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to one question so we can get to as many people as possible, thanks for your cooperation operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Unidentified Conference Call Participant : This is R.K on behalf of Rod, thanks for taking my question. Given that some of your competitors are also reporting weak results; could you comment on the overall demand environment? And what could be driving the weakness and also talk about when you aim to return to a product revenue growth? George Kurian : I think if you look at the overall demand environment for data center spending, I think it reflects two broad themes, in some parts of the world where there are notable changes in the macroeconomic outlook people are taking a bit longer to define their annual budget plans for building a contingency budget model and buying for what they need or requiring more number of approvals for larger transactions like we said last quarter, we saw some of that reflected in our European business this past quarter. In other parts of the world where the economy is stronger we do see people looking at sort of their data center priorities, what would they refresh within their data center, what would they think about moving to public clouds, we are well positioned to capitalize on that trend using our data fabric strategy that is reflected in some of the acceleration of our data services results this quarter. We plan for next year for a low growth environment, as Ron mentioned the investments we\u2019re making to capitalize on the strength of our portfolio should pay off through the course of the year and for the whole year you should see strength in the product revenues materialize especially in the back half of the year. You know, I feel like this is an environment that we are particularly well set up for, we have demonstrated our ability to execute against our topmost priorities, we are entering fiscal 2020 with a much stronger portfolio than we\u2019ve had even in years passed and we are demonstrating our ability to meet the financial targets we set out by prioritizing carefully with trade off decisions across the company. Kris Newton : Thanks R.K. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman with Cowen. Karl Ackerman : Hi, thank you for taking my question. In regards to your outlook, I think your implicit guide $4 or $5 plus in EPS for fiscal 2020 does assume a fairly sizable increase or ramp beyond the July quarter. I'm curious what EPS in revenue contributions are you assuming for ELAs for the full year? And I guess how would you characterize your own level of visibility into the channel and at key OEMs? Thank you. Ron Pasek : So, yeah, Carl we didn't guide EPS explicitly but you're right your calculation is probably roughly correct. But we saw this year was about 2% of revenue for ELAs, it wasn't evenly spread by quarter as you noticed, we would assume that for next year, in the Q1 guide there are no ELAs right now, so you have to assume that the other 2% of total year occurs in Q2, Q3 and Q4. George Kurian : I think with regard to your question about visibility to the channel and the OEM, I think in the OEM business we are prioritizing our focus on a few players and are restructuring our agreements on the smaller OEMs, which is why we have indicated that OEM will be a materially step lower going forward. With regard to our distribution channel, we have a broad-based distribution channel that covers a large part of the market. We have a lot of access to our largest customers. We cover probably 95% of the Fortune 1000 and a high number of the Global 2000\u2019s are customers of NetApp and a majority of them are strategic customers, meaning buying large amounts from us. So very, very close to them and close to the channel and we expect that we'll be able to see the visibility on any turn faster than most people. Kris Newton : Thanks Carl. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Nowinski with Piper Jaffray. Andrew Nowinski : Great thank you, I want to ask a question on cloud data services, so you mentioned that Azure will be generally available in Q1 and I think Amazon is already GA, so is Google, if you could just give us any color as to when Google will be GA. and when? That's it from me thanks. George Kurian : We are in beta with Google and we are seeing good success with them, I think we will have to update you on when we expect that we generally available at the right point in time, we are doing all of the necessary things to get that service to general availability and it does not preclude us from being able to take revenue generating customers on the Google cloud platform, ultimately the general availability of these services are determined by the hyperscalers and so we do everything that we need to do to make them comfortable to make it generally available but it's in their hands. Andrew Nowinski : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks Andy. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steve Milunovich with Wolfe Research. Steve Milunovich : Thank you. If my numbers are right, America's commercial was up about 12%, public was down 11%, Europe was down 17%. You said a little bit about Europe but, can you give us some more color on each of those and kind of what you expect going forward? George Kurian : Yeah let me characterize each of them, I think in the Americas business our strength in the portfolio as well as the opportunity to invest more in the Americas enterprise segment continues to give us real good confidence about the performance of our business, we had really good, you know traction with our largest customers as well through the course of the year with these strategic agreements. I think with the public sector business, you know we\u2019ve been doing a couple of things there. I think we've been working to transition some of our investments over to opportunities like Flex, state and local education as well as healthcare, and those transitions have paid back in really materially strong results this year. We are going to expand the range of offers that we have for the public sector market, we are working with both the hyperscalers to offer Fed ramp services and will update you at the right point in time when they're available, as well as we\u2019re focused on bringing our ECI products that needs the public sector certification requirements to market in time for this buying season, I think those two should contribute to further strengthen our public sector business this year. In EMEA we saw a couple of things, some transformations at some of our biggest customers that were exposed to both specific situations as well as the broader economic landscape in EMEA. I think there is also a 500 basis points currency headwind on the EMEA results in quarter. So we saw, we've got a couple of things going on in EMEA. You saw us prioritize our resources to the biggest most attractive customer segments and markets through the course of the last quarter, that was something that we had been planning to do and we exited some of the smaller countries so that we can prioritize NetApp sales resources to leverage our biggest, our portfolio in the biggest market and so we expect to have a good results this coming year in EMEA. Kris Newton : Thanks Steve. Next question? Operator : Thank you our next question comes from Matt Campbell with Credit Suisse. Unidentified Conference Call Participant : Yeah, thank you. Just wondering if you can talk a little bit about the wider competitive environment and just if you've seen any changes to the pricing behavior as demand has become a little bit more challenging? George Kurian : You know I think there has been no material change to the overall competitive environment, on any particular transaction you always see some players sort of resort to irrational pricing and we have the discipline to walk away from loss making transactions, I think the overall strength of our portfolio is demonstrated in product gross margins right, it is the ninth consecutive quarter where we have grown product gross margin, then it\u2019s reflective both of the differentiation in the portfolio, the power of our data fabric strategy which is the long term differentiator for us in any situation and the increasing contribution of software to our product mix, all things that we have strategically been working on and it\u2019s paying out for our shareholders and for our customers. Kris Newton : Thanks Matt. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Unidentified Conference Call Participant : Hi guys, this is Victor Chu in for Simon Leopold. Regarding the decline in the hardware maintenance revenue can you help us think about the broader implications here? Is this reflective of shifts in customer's plans maybe shifting to the hybrid public cloud or new architecture that you are planning on deploying or maybe competitive issues here, just help us little here with a little more color around the decline this quarter. George Kurian : Yeah, Victor, we told you in FY 18 it was a headwind but we could tell from the waterfall that in FY 19 it wouldn't be and through the first three quarters we did execute reasonably well and was not a headwind at all, in fact we grow slightly. We had some execution issues in Q4 which I wouldn\u2019t put on our customers I would put that squarely on her shoulder. We know what we need to do. We're making some needed changes in that area and we believe and very strongly that since the asset base is growing that FY 2020 will be a growth year for maintenance and so. Ron Pasek : I think one thing you should note is that we really look at the maintenance business in aggregate between both software and hardware. A few years ago we made a strategic pricing change to reflect the value of our offerings more in software and so when you look at the mix of hardware and software it would send towards software and I would ask you to just understand our business in aggregate rather than as piece parts. Operator : Thank you. Our next question from Lue Miscotia [ph] with Tiva [ph]. Unidentified Conference Call Participant : Okay thank you. If you could actually go into the all-flash array area why do you think you grown lower than your expectation and then obviously if you look at to be let's say the first quarter and the first of next year why do you think you need to start to back on track with that as you've mentioned that should be something that you think you could do? George Kurian : The thing is as we noted some of the issues that we experienced within the quarter which is the three specific items we talked about where we had to reprioritize sales resources to offset some of the slower spending in our largest customers it took longer than we needed to do that. The second, the OEM business which has a material you know a part of it is also solid state storage and then the third is our renewals which is also overweight on solid-state. I think all of those issues were fairly particularly acutely within the ASA segment. I think if you look at what actions we are taking to increase sales coverage and to align those resources against our biggest customer opportunities, we have seen the results from this year from moves we made earlier in the year, for example, prioritizing certain segments over others we have seen that pay off through the course of the year and we are really confident that as we continue to do more of that the first place it should return to growth is actually ASA. Operator : Thank you next question comes from Jim Suva with Citi. Jim Suva : Thank you very much. George in your opening comments you mentioned some execution issues internally I know you had mentioned that you're making changes you're making changes, that's great to hear. What are the changes, what were the challenges so investors can feel more comfortable that they are quick solvable or maybe they take a long time to solve, if you could help us understand that thank you. George Kurian : Absolutely, you know first of all I take execution particularly seriously. I think we have demonstrated a strong track record of it. And I'm disappointed at the quality of the execution this quarter. As we said there were three fundamental issues. The first one we have certain customers that are taking a longer time to make purchasing decisions. I think all of that datacenter players or a multiple of them are reporting that. We have the opportunity however given the strength of our portfolio to relocate and make investment in higher growth areas and higher particularly attractive segments. For example, we reprioritize some resources within public sector from Fed to Sled or Fed to healthcare and we saw a really strong return on that through the course of the year. We didn't do enough and we didn't do it enough you know fast enough to react to what we saw in January and so I am disappointed. But I'm confident that the moves that we made should pay off through the course of fiscal 2020 which is why we have an outlook that is quite good for fiscal year 2020. The second is in the renewals. We've made organizational changes and process changes to drive much more deeper inspection of our ability to capture the full asset portfolio that we have available for renewals. As Ron mentioned in his remarks the total asset count is growing in our installed base and deferred revenue was up 9% year-over-year. So it's really a matter of execution on renewals within the quarter and you'll see us drive that with a lot more intensity. The third was the OEM business, and here we do not forecast a return to where it was. I think what we are doing is really prioritizing a couple of the big OEMs and really staying close to them, and for the rest we are going to take down our outlook for the go forward. I think it is the lower priority use of NetApp resources. And we have so many other attractive opportunities to focus and execute against. We will give you updates on the progress of our execution plans as we come back to you through the course of next year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi with Lake Street. Eric Martinuzzi : Yeah, my question has to do with the workforce realignment. What was the headcount maybe you gave it but I missed it, what was the headcount ending the fiscal year 2019 and then were we sort of post realignment? Ron Pasek : Yeah, let me get you the numbers, but this is not a reduction in force in a traditional sense as we have told you we are going to start initial transformation, we will be making adjustments very surgically. We did some last year, we did some in Q4, we are going to do some in Q1. We should not think about reduction as much as a realignment of resources for the right skill set in the right places. Our total headcount as of the end of the year was 10,541 with a slight increase year-over-year, again not significant. In many cases we added heads in lower cost locations, so it didn\u2019t increase our overall cost base. George Kurian : As Ron mentioned, we continue to see phenomenal opportunity with our portfolio of all-flash arrays, private cloud and public cloud data services, we are entering fiscal year 2020 with that portfolio materially stronger than it was in fiscal 2019. And so what we are doing and what we are going to continue to do through the course of the year is to prioritize coverage and investment against the most attractive market segments and market opportunities, right and that to fund that, we are going to stay disciplined and reprioritize investments away from lower value activities and lower value smaller countries, and that's really kind of what we did with the changes we've made. Eric Martinuzzi : Okay so just a recap here based on your comments about the operating expenses not changing much in fiscal 2020, we would expect the headcount to be relatively similar to that 10,541. George Kurian : That's correct, it may change around the world, we may see more heads in lower cost locations but the overall headcount number would not change dramatically. Eric Martinuzzi : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes, thanks for taking my question and I apologize I joined the con late in case the question has already been asked. George, I want to better understand your forecasting in some more details that gives you the confidence that for the revenue on a year-over-year basis is going to rebound. What I have seen over the past six months is some of these forecasts have not really materialized, it seems like your enterprise customers have already upgraded what they need to upgrade. The whole cloud migration, hybrid cloud has already reached a plateauing, and in that context what is it out there that you see that gives you the confidence that this time your forecast is actually going to materialize? George Kurian : I think first of all we have close relationships with most of the largest customers in the world and for those that we don't we are going to put direct NetApp resources to cover them and you will see of those investments being made within the financial envelope of our long-term operating model. And I think that's prudent and it is a part of our ongoing portfolio management and portfolio optimization. I think a couple of things give us confidence, right. The first is cloud data services which has been a work in progress for quite a while is now generally available. I think if you saw the performance of our business this past - the second half of this year in cloud data services it has been strong, and I would just say that the cloud migrations have not really been completed, right. I think of the low value workloads, yes those might have migrated but the enterprise workloads have not yet moved and so we are well positioned to capture that because of the capabilities we now bring to the hyperscalers that enable that and that allows us to go after a bigger wallet rather than just a NetApp installed base, right. We are seeing a good percentage of our cloud customers being net new customers. The second is our private cloud portfolio which is as customers make priority decisions within their own data center envelope, albeit that might be diminished relative to last year or a few months ago, they are prioritizing private cloud build-outs and I think we are well positioned for that. I don't dispute the fact that we have to go and prove our execution out. But I do feel that next year's outlook is against for the second half of the year, particularly is against muted compares given this year. And so we are being balanced in terms of how we are trying to run the business, investing against known areas of strength. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Ader with William Blair. Jason Ader : Thank you. On the NetApp HCI product, I think you gave - I don\u2019t think you ever given numbers for private cloud. Maybe I'm wrong but I think you said $150 million in the quarter, $600 million run rate. First of all, is that, is that accurate? George Kurian : Yeah, that is accurate. It's for NetApp private cloud which is SolidFire, NetApp HCI and NetApp StorageGRID optic storage. Jason Ader : Got you. Could you give us some ballpark amount or ballpark percentage that HCI is at 10%, 20% just on ballpark like give a wide range? George Kurian : I'll just tell you that we are pleased with all of them. All of them performed really well through the course of the year and they are a material contributor to our growth outlook. We will give you more color on that through the course of the year, I'll just say that HCI is growing as a share of the overall business. Jason Ader : Okay. Great and then just a follow-up quickly. Would you -- do you have an updated data to suggest whether NetApp HCI is cannibalistic at all to the core storage business? George Kurian : It's too early for me to comment on that. I feel like it's an opportunity for us to gain net new customers. We\u2019ll give you more color on that as we understand customer's buying behavior through the course of the year. You\u2019ll see us provide more clarity on some of these areas through the course of the year and I'll just tell you that I\u2019m extraordinarily pleased with the progress through the course of this year. For three consecutive quarters, we have done really, really well reflecting the strength of all the elements of those portfolios. And really betting on the hypothesis that enterprise-grade hybrid cloud infrastructure with displays first-generation hyper-converged, we are seeing that happen. Jason Ader : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. Nehal Chokshi : Yeah, thank you. Where should I put operating margin plans that's down 450 basis points year-over-year. Could you parse that between OpEx and gross margin? George Kurian : Yeah, so most of it if you remember in Q1 2019, we had $90 million of ELAs which was very beneficial to gross margin and our margin, so most of that is actually gross margin. Nehal Chokshi : Got it okay and if I may, through new execution issue is that constraint to a particular protocol or type of a ray or is it broad-based. George Kurian : No, it's broad-based. Nehal Chokshi : Okay great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nikolay Todorov with Longbow. Nikolay Todorov : Hey guys, good afternoon. Recent industry announcements for cloud services kind of validate you're approaching the market and you guys have a first mover advantage. Can you talk about how you see the market evolving from over here? And also can you share if you have a cloud services AIR target for existing fiscal year 2020? George Kurian : We don't have one broken out for fiscal year 2020. I want to say that we are confident in our target for fiscal year 2021 and you know we expect that the general availability of Azure NetApp Files will be, -should be a step function increase in our opportunity with cloud data services and so we have a room to really accelerate that business this year. I would say we are differentiated on multiple fronts, right. We are differentiated in the number of offerings we have on the way they have integrated with cloud providers, on the ability for us to build truly hybrid cloud workflows given the uniqueness of some of our data movers like SnapMirror and others. And we are expanding beyond just data services to include services like NetApp Cooper service which gives the customer the ability to move apps and data in a portable way across cloud. So we are first leader, first mover advantage. We have world-class technology. We are really excited at the work we're doing with hyperscalers and this is an area of material improvement to our business this coming year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Matt Sheerin : Thank you. George you talked earlier about the issues you're seeing with large enterprise customers taking longer to pull the trigger on deals and certainly some of your competitors are saying the same thing. Are there any particular reasons that you can point to those issues and as you look toward the rest of the fiscal year and expecting a return to growth. Is that lumpiness still factored into your guidance and your outlook? George Kurian : Yeah, you know, we continue to be cautious. I think that's reflected in our outlook, I think that we seek two particular reasons for that, the lumpiness or the slow approvals of data centers spending. One is in some parts of the world, there are economic considerations that are affecting specific customers who are undergoing their own transformation and when they undergo a transformation, they put spending on hold until the shape of that transformation comes into play. We did see that in some parts of our European business. The second is in other parts of the world, they are going through the evaluation of their hybrid cloud journey. I think that's both an opportunity for us because of the unique positioning to our offerings, but we may also have seen more of it given that we are one of the few players who can offer solutions on either side and so maybe what customers are starting to do is take that journey first with our platform. So, I think that's both an opportunity plus an area that we are following keenly. We have seen that when we make investments to cover the market more broadly given the strength of our portfolio, that they do pay off. We've seen that through the course of this year. As I said we stepped out of China in the early part of the year and struck a joint venture there which is off to a good start. We stepped out of certain countries in Europe this past quarter and refocused our resources within the public sector markets. We've made targeted moves to places where we saw healthier spending patterns. And you'll see us continue to do that through the course of this coming year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer. George Iwanyc : Thank you for taking my question. Ron, when you look at seasonality, I think you mentioned that you expected the relatively normal contributions for the full year. What are the puts and takes given the way that you've started, do you expect maybe a little bit higher peak at the end of the calendar year or is this being made up a little bit more at the end of the fiscal year? Ron Pasek : You know it's hard to say I think to [indiscernible] as I noted was the ELAs which tend to come in based on customer demand. So, as you noticed last year, almost half of the ELAs came in Q1. That could happen in any given quarter through the year so I think the base business is going to be a fairly traditional seasonal pattern, with each quarter as essentially bigger than the prior one, and then the thing that you'll lay on top is some amount of ELAs which right now I can't see in Q1. And quite frankly I'm not, I don't have any specific targets for the other quarters as well. But we do believe those will still be at roughly 2% of revenue as they were this year. George Iwanyc : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Wamsi Mohan : Yes, thank you. For cloud data services, there are some hesitancy here to guide fiscal 2020, where you spoke about very strong exit for the last months sounded like you did about $17 million in this year. Is there a way that you could benchmark? And why is there a hesitancy just given that you have significant amount of confidence looking at fiscal 2021 to exit within the range. So it'll be helpful from a modeling perspective to understand where that trajectory is even if you could give us some guideposts if not exact numbers very specifically, some ranges that we can think about would be helpful. And secondarily the half over half growth in cloud data services and private cloud, how does that look? I mean it seems like there is a lot of it hinging on that based on second half versus first half. So any quantification there also would be helpful. Thank you. George Kurian : Listen I don't think you should have any indication that we don't have confidence in these offerings, right. We don't guide below the one single revenue number. We've never done that and we're not going to do that going forward. But that has zero, let me repeat, zero correlation with our confidence in these platforms. I think that we continue, as I've said at the start, we continue to believe that these offerings will grow through the course of the year as we expand our coverage as we bring more and more customers on board, you'll see us providing you updates through the course of the quarter. But I would not, I don't want to set up a precedent by guiding below the revenue line. I think you should just take the fact that we have demonstrated really strong results through the course of the year. We have a track record when we say we're going to do something to be disciplined about going and doing that, and I think that we are being cautious about the outlook for next year. And all of those has factored into the guidance that we are giving. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our question-and-answer session for today. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. George Kurian for any closing remarks. George Kurian : In closing, I'd like to leave you with a few thoughts. We have met our commitments on financial results and shareholder returns each year that I've been CEO, a track record that I intend to keep going forward. Customers and partners choose NetApp because of our data fabric strategy which is aligned with their IT roadmap. This creates the opportunity for strong market share gains on-premises and in the cloud. What we're doing in the cloud also drives wallet share gain on-premises. We have three strong and differentiated growth engines where we see the biggest opportunity, flash, private cloud and public cloud data services. We expect our flash business to reaccelerate and private and public cloud revenue to grow substantially in fiscal year 2020. We are moving quickly to improve our execution and to capitalize on this opportunity while staying within the boundaries of our financial model and continue to deliver strong shareholder returns. We started these investments in fiscal 2019. We'll continue them in fiscal year 2020. And I'm confident that they will pay off in fiscal year 2020 and beyond. Thank you again and I'll speak with you next quarter. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

My name is Latif and I will your conference call coordinator for today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. I will now turn the call over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Please proceed Ms. Newton. Kris Newton : Thank you for joining us on our Q1 fiscal year 2020 earnings call. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Ron Pasek. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com. During today\u2019s call we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects such as our guidance for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2020. Our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability, shareholder returns and our ability to improve execution, gain share and expand our sales capacity without increasing total operating expenses, all of which involve risk and uncertainty.  We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially for a variety of reasons including macroeconomic and market conditions, the IT capital spending environment and our ability to expand our total available market, acquire new accounts and new buyers, expand in existing accounts, capitalize on our data fabric strategy, improve the consistency of our sales execution and continue our capital allocation strategy. Please also refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC and available on our website, specifically our most recent Form 10-K for fiscal year 2019 including the Management\u2019s Discussion Analysis of financial condition and results of operations and risk factor sections and our Current Reports on Form 8-K. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of the GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are posted on our website.  I'll now turn the call over to George. George Kurian : Thanks Kris. Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us. As we discussed on our call on August 1, while I'm clearly disappointed in our weaker than expected top line results, the fundamentals of our business are robust and I am confident that we have the right strategy and technologies to address the market transitions to all-flash arrays, Private Cloud, and Cloud Data Services.  We have a strong business model as a result of the hard work we conducted to improve gross margin and cost structure over the last several years. This enables us to navigate the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds and make the strategic moves that position us well to return to growth.  We have further analyzed the dynamics of what happened in the first quarter and they confirm that we are seeing a combination of slowdown related to overall macro conditions and company-specific, go-to-market execution issues. We continue to see pressure on deal sizes, longer sales cycles, and deferral of transactions. But as I noted on our earlier call, our underperformance is not across the Board. Our APAC, Europe, and U.S. Public Sector geographies were mostly on track.  Even in the areas where we experienced the greatest weakness, top global accounts and the Americas, there were pockets of strength and high performing teams. We have been very successful with some of our global accounts, but we need to expand our wallet share in others. We have deep relationships with too few of these customers, which increases our susceptibility to a slowdown in spending related to the macro.  In the Americas roughly 40% of our districts were successful in acquiring new customers, reaching new buyers within existing customers and effectively selling our entire portfolio, and as a result grew year-over-year.  Performance across districts is inconsistent. Our sales leadership and I are committed to improving our sales execution through necessary leadership changes, better inspection, and discipline, expanded account coverage, acquisition and portfolio selling. Let me underscore the fact that we do not believe that the revenue shortfall was related to a change in the competitive environment. Our win rates remain constant and our product gross margins remain strong. In short, we need to replicate our proven areas of success by getting in front of more buyers with our full portfolio.  To better capitalize on our opportunity, we will expand our sales capacity without increasing total operating expenses, by continuing to make disciplined tradeoffs in our spending priorities. To that end, I will now provide more detail on the specific steps we are taking. First, we plan to add approximately 200 primary sales resources in the next 12 months with a focus in the Americas. We will do this without increasing the total operating expenses for the company. The new sales headcount will focus on acquiring new accounts as well as engaging new buyers and finding new opportunities in existing accounts.  Second, we will sharpen the focus of our all-flash, go-to-market, including marketing sales and services to emphasize our strong value proposition in mission critical environments where customers continue to prioritize spending. We expect that this, combined with additional sales capacity will return us to a position of growth in the all-flash market. Third, now that our services are generally available in Azure and will soon be in Google, we expect to see an acceleration of Cloud Data Services revenue as their sales teams ramp in selling our service. We continue to focus on expanding the range of use cases and deployment scenarios and enabling the various pathways to market to sell these services.  And finally, we will scale our growth in the Private Cloud market through focused marketing and sales efforts. The increased sales capacity focused on reaching non-storage buyers will support this effort. We are materially stepping-up our efforts to address the appropriate buyers for our Private Cloud and Cloud Data Services offering as they are different from our traditional storage buyers. To recap, I am confident that we can return to growth by increasing our sales capacity, adding new accounts, reaching new non-storage buyers, and selling the full portfolio. We expect that these efforts will accelerate our participation in the growing Private Cloud and Cloud Data Services markets and drive share gains. Additionally, these actions will broaden our pipeline, while lowering risks stemming from customer concentration.  In Q1 our all-flash array business inclusive of All-Flash FAS, EF, and SolidFire products and services declined 24% year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run-rate of $1.7 billion. This comparison includes a significant amount of ELA revenue related to all-flash in Q1 a year ago, that did not repeat in Q1 this year. While I'm disappointed by the performance of this part of the business, I remain confident in our competitive positioning and our opportunity for continued success. We have industry leading, guaranteed storage efficiency, the highest performance and the most complete Cloud integration in the market today. And the actions we are taking to increase sales coverage and target mission critical workloads will help return our all-flash business to growth.  Moving to our Private Cloud Solutions, SolidFire NetApp HCI and Storage Grid are the building blocks for Private Cloud deployments, enabling customers to bring Public Cloud-like experience and economics into their data centers. Our Private Cloud business, inclusive of products and services, attained an annualized net revenue run rate of $250 million in the first quarter, up 85% year-over-year. Now on to Cloud Data Services. In Q1, we achieved general availability with Microsoft, with Azure NetApp Files, and beta release with Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud. Based on the last month of Q1, our annualized recurring revenue for Cloud Data Services increased to approximately $61 million, up 189% year-over-year. We continue to see a healthy mix of customers new to NetApp in our Cloud Services and expect that Cloud Services will continue to enable us to reach new buyers and contribute to our acquisition of new customers.  We are very pleased with the initial ramp of Azure NetApp Files since becoming generally available. I'll share a customer example to illustrate why we're so excited.  We are working with a Fortune 10 company to meet its Cloud First Initiative. While delivering an equal or better experience to their on-premises environment, with all the agility benefits of the Cloud. The customer began testing Azure NetApp Files while it was in preview and now that it\u2019s generally available, they've established a footprint of almost two petabytes and are growing by a 100 terabyte per week. While some of this data will migrate from existing NetApp Systems, roughly two-thirds of the data they will move to Azure NetApp files, currently resides on Competitor Storage Systems. Our sales team partnered closely with the Azure team to leverage our expertise to help the customer establish a data strategy in the Cloud.  By working directly with the customers Cloud leadership, we have moved from being merely an infrastructure provider with a minority position in the customer's data center, to a key strategic partner. This is a great example on not only how our Cloud Strategy helps us expand our opportunity by displacing competitive footprint, but how also reaching new buyers; in this case the Cloud team contributes to our growth. As I have described many times, customers and partners are choosing NetApp because of our data fabric strategy and our unique relationships with the hyperscale Cloud providers. Before closing, I would like to acknowledge and thank some longtime NetAppers who are moving on for their contributions to our company. Tom Mendoza, Vice Chairman; Joel Reich, EVP Storage Systems and Software Business Unit; and Thomas Stanley, Senior VP of the Americas; we wish them all well.  As we align to execute and thrive in a highly dynamic environment, change is inevitable. To that end, I'd like to recognize two key promotions; Brad Anderson to EVP and GM, overseeing both our Cloud Infrastructure and Storage Systems and Software Business Units; and Scott Allen to Chief Accounting Officer. I would also like to welcome Sanjay Rohatgi, Senior VP and GM of Asia Pacific. I look forward to their contributions in the continuing evolution of NetApp. I am confident in our strategy and the fundamentals of our business model. Our continued strong cash generation is a great example of the underlying health of our business. We remain committed to our capital allocation policy of returning cash to shareholders through share buybacks and the recently increased quarterly dividend.  We will remain fiscally disciplined with our expenditures, while still investing for the long term health of our business. We consistently receive positive feedback from our customers and partners on the value of our data fabric strategy and the strong performance of our best teams demonstrates our ability to capitalize on the strength. We are confident that we can return to growth by replicating their success in reaching more customers and buying centers with our full portfolio. We will keep you updated on the progress of these initiatives on future calls.  I'll now turn the call over to Ron. Ron? Ron Pasek : Thanks, George. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. To reiterate George's sentiment, we are clearly disappointed with the Q1 results and are committed to addressing the challenges we faced during the quarter.  Despite the magnitude of our Q1 revenue shortfall, the gross margin and cost structure improvements we've made over the last three years provide support for our free cash flow generation. As a result, we remain committed to our capital allocation strategy of returning cast to shareholders to share buybacks and our recently increased quarterly dividend.  Before discussing our guidance, I'll provide further detail on our Q1 performance. In Q1, net revenues of $1.236 billion were down 16% year-over-year, including over 1 point of currency headwind. Product revenue of $644 million decreased approximately 26% year-over-year. As a reminder, the Q1 \u201819 compare includes $90 million of ELA revenues which did not repeat this quarter. Adjusting for ELAs Q1 revenue would have been down approximately 11% and product revenues would have been down approximately 18%.  Moving down the P&L, software maintenance and hardware maintenance revenue of $523 million decreased 1% year-over-year and was flat when adjusting for currency. Deferred revenue which was up 8% year-over-year in Q1 continues to be a strong indicator of the health of our installed base.  As we mentioned on the Q4 call, and to provide greater insight into the dynamics of our business, we have updated our strategic and mature product view. Strategic product revenue includes add-on software, Private Cloud Solutions, and all products related to all-flash arrays. Mature product revenue now includes OEM and all products related to disk and hybrid arrays. A historical recast of the strategic mature break-out can be found on our website. As a reminder, Cloud Data Services revenue is included in software and maintenance.  Gross margin of 67.2% was above the high end of our guidance range and includes approximately a 0.5 point of currency headwind. Product gross margin was 53.4%, which is an increase of 2.8 points year-over-year when adjusting for ELAs.  The increase was driven by sales force discipline and cost reduction and includes nearly a point of currency headwinds. Q1 was the 10th straight quarter we increased product margins year-over-year when adjusting for the benefit of ELAs. The combination of software and hardware maintenance and other services gross margin of 82.1% increased by 50 basis points year-over-year. Q1 operating expenses of $652 million were flat year-over-year, operating margin was 14.4%.  EPS of $0.65 was above the preliminary estimate we provided on our August 1 call, but below our original guidance range. We closed Q1 with $3.5 billion in cash and short term investments. Our cash conversion cycle was a negative 10 days, up 10 days year-over-year. DSO of 40 days was up two days year-over-year and down 30 days sequentially. The under performance in revenue in the quarter drove DIO to 25 days, an 8 day increase year-over-year.  We expect our cash conversion cycle to remain negative throughout fiscal 2020. Despite the revenue shortfall in the quarter, cash flow from operations was $310 million. Free cash flow of $278 million represented 22% of revenues and was up approximate 6% year-over-year. During Q1 we repurchased 3.9 million shares at an average price of $64.87 for a total of $250 million, which is consistent with our planned run rate heading into fiscal 2020. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were $243 million, down $26 million year-over-year representing a 10% decrease. During the quarter we paid out $115 million in cash dividends. In total we returned $365 million to shareholders representing 131% of free cash flow generated in the quarter. Our fiscal Q2 cash dividend is $0.48 per share. Now on to guidance. As we discussed on our August 1 call, we expect revenues for fiscal 2020 to be down between 5% and 10% year-over-year. We continue to expect sequential growth within the year to be consistent with our normal seasonal patterns, except for the volatility introduced by ELAs. For fiscal 2020 we now expect gross margin to be in the range of 66% to 67%, above our previous guidance range of 64% to 65%, due primarily to the mix shift towards higher margin maintenance revenues as a result of the weakness in product sales.  Operating margin for fiscal 2020 is expected to be in the range of 19% to 22%. Implied in this guidance is our expectation that operating expenses will be flat to slightly down year-over-year in fiscal 2020.  As George highlighted, we expect at add 200 headcount to our sales coverage model over the next 12 months. As a result of the current revenue guidance, we expect EPS to be down between 2% and 15% year-over-year without the benefit of buy backs.  Given the relative weakness of America's business in Q1, we now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 18% to 19% in fiscal 2020. Additionally we expect to continue to generate meaningful free cash flow in the range of 19% to 21% of revenues. Now onto Q2 guidance. We expect Q2 net revenues to range between $1.325 billion and $1.475 billion, which at the midpoint implies an 8% decline in revenues year-over-year, including over a point of currency headwind.  For Q2 we expect consolidated gross margin to be approximate 66% and operating margin to be between 18% and 19%. We expect earnings per share for the second quarter to range between $0.91 and $0.99 per share.  We are diligently focused on improved execution and addressing the challenges we face. We are committed to returning the company to grow as we implement the action plan George outlined, and we remain confident our business model leverage will enable us to deliver long term shareholder returns. With that, I'll turn it back to Kris s to open the call for Q&A. Kris. Kris Newton : We\u2019ll now open the call for Q&A. Please be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to one question, so we can get to as many people as possible. Thanks for your cooperation. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from a line of Nehal Chokshi of Maxim Group. Your line is open. Nehal Chokshi : Thank you. You probably covered this in the script, but your guidance does call for a significant improvement in the year-of-year revenue growth profile, and I appreciate all the detail on what you are doing to address the shortfall. Is it true to say that these things that you're doing, you expect to actually results in that improvement this quickly? Ron Pasek : If you look at our Q2 seasonality, there are sort of two or three elements that come into play. The first is Q2 is typically a strong quarter for our U.S. public sector business. The second is, Cloud Data Services and our Private Cloud business should continue to perform in a normal seasonal acceleration model, and then the third is that we have factored in and probability weighted a little impact from ELAs in Q2. As you might note from the call script, we did not see any ELAs in Q1. Nehal Chokshi : Understood. Okay, and then the deferred revenue continues to trend up year-over-year despite the significant year-over-year product revenue decline, below even the July 2015 and July 2016 levels. Is it safe to say that this is a reflection of an increase in attachment of software and services per dollar of installed base? George Kurian : So, it's a function of several things, that's one. It's also a function of we're doing a little better job on renewals and point of sales. The point of sales rate for services held steady. So, you know, it\u2019s a focus area and has been for a while, we told you that, and we're doing a little better in it. Nehal Chokshi : Okay, great. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks Nehal. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Rod Hall of Goldman Sachs. Your question please. Rod Hall : Yeah, thanks for the question guys. I wanted to start off I guess with the AFA weakness you called out George and fee of \u2013 yet, it looks like I mean if we back that out, the hybrid trajectory was okay. I mean things seem more stable there, so I wonder if you could just drill into that in a little bit more detail, what you see going on there. Is it the factor of this macro weakness or are you seeing people backing off of AFA investment, but keeping up with hybrid.  And then I wanted to just double-check this as a housekeeping measure. You are guiding with ELAs in the guide this quarter. Just wanted to check that, because I thought previously you guys had decided not to guide ELAs anymore. So thanks. Ron Pasek : So Ron, so it\u2019s factored in with a probability. So there's some in there, we factored it down a little bit, just in case, so \u2013 and there was some in there last year, so that\u2019s a fair compare. But we didn\u2019t put it in at the full value. George Kurian : With regard to the mix of AFA\u2019s and hybrid, you know if you recall last year we had two elements that drove the AFA business. The first was we had several large global customers that purchased a lot of AFAs, and as we noted on our call, those customers are most impacted by the spending slowdown in the hardware.  The second was that we also had about $90 million of ELAs last year, and a good chunk of that was attributed to all-flash purchases. So those two one-time items, on the compare was what drove the AFA number down substantially more than HFA. I would not say that there was any pattern of customers not choosing AFAs as opposed to HFAs in the broad demand environment. Rod Hall : Okay, great. Thank you, George. Kris Newton : Thanks Rod. Next question? Operator : Next question comes from Matt Cabral of Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Matt Cabral : Thank you. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about what's driving the uptick in gross margin guidance for the year, and in particular just how we should think about the trajectory of product margins against just the potential for a pickup in the competitive environment if some of the slower deal environment lingers a little bit. Ron Pasek : Yes, so there is a couple of factors. The biggest one is, obviously, you can see that in the quarter as well. You know the product revenue was down year-over-year. So, as a result, the services margin which is higher than product weighs higher on the overall margin and pushes the overall margin up. Having said that, we\u2019ve told you for the last several years we're working on improving gross margins. We've had 10 consecutive quarters of gross margin improvement on the product margin side and that should continue throughout the year a little bit, both from a pricing standpoint and then some costs as well. George Kurian : I want to call out the good work done by our sales teams on maintaining discipline. I know that, you know there are some people who think that there's a tradeoff between revenue and margin. I think our teams have remained disciplined around the pricing environment. The strong gross margin indicates our competitive differentiation, and we have not walked away from revenue due to concerns about gross margin. We have strategically used gross margin and our business model as an opportunity where we felt like it warranted it. Matt Cabral : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks Matt. Next question? Operator : The next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of SIG. Your line is open. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes, thanks for taking my question. George, going back to your comment on AFA. It seems to me that even if I were to exclude the ELA from FY \u201919 the overall AFA revenue could be down in the high teen, FY \u201920 versus FY \u201919, is that a fare assumption? George Kurian : It is down a good amount. I think it is primarily due to you know our exposure from being very broadly deployed in big global strategic accounts that did not have as robust a spending pattern this year. The AFA business is the dominant business that we have in the big global customers and they were the most impacted by some of the uncertainty that we saw with regard to macro. Kris Newton : Thank you, Mehdi. Next question? Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Nowinski of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Andrew Nowinski : Great, thank you. I just had a question on your OEM business. Last quarter you talked about moving away from some OEM partners and focusing more, on more strategic partners such as Lenovo. I think the OEM revenues included in the mature segments. I was wondering is that $307 million you did in mature this quarter in-line with what you're expecting or did you also see weakness at your OEM partners? Thanks. Ron Pasek : We saw a little bit of weakness, and as you know it can be fairly lumpy, it's hard to predict often times what OEM customers are going to buy. We feel comfortable with the outlook for the year for OEM, which as we told you last quarter is probably not as robust and we are accepting that, but again we didn\u2019t see a robust quarter this quarter, we do expect to make the year as planned. George Kurian : OEM is a small percentage of the mature category. It\u2019s frankly the smallest percentage of the matured category. We are driving focus on Lenovo and it'll take some time for that business to wrap. Once it ramps, it will stabilize the OEM revenue. Andrew Nowinski : Alright, thanks. Kris Newton : Thanks Andy. Next question? Operator : Next question comes from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Katy Huberty : Yes, thank you. George you talked about why your Flash business in particular is down double digits this quarter given that the large enterprise exposure. What do you think the market for flash storage did in the quarter, the market also declining? And then can you talk about how long it will take for the 200 new hires to reach their full sales quota and what would be the funding source of those given you don't expect to grow OpEx? Thanks. George Kurian : I couldn't comment yet on the overall Flash market Katy. I think that our view is that as NAND prices remain low, you know Flash is compellingly better technology than disc for a broad range of you know transactional applications and so as a percentage of a mix, it should benefit from the fact that NAND prices are lower.  In terms of the head count that \u2013 so we are going to have to wait to see what other people report and sort of an overall market wrap-up to comment about Flash. We think that in our case the concentration of our largest customers, also being our largest Flash customers drove the sort of change in our Flash business.  With regard to the investment we're making in sales and primary demand creation headcount, they are not all discreet quarter bearing headcount; there are some technical sales headcount as well. We are going to do that over 12 months. I think you will see a ramp through that period as we get operationally ready and deploy the sales headcount and so you should quarterize 200 over four quarters and it typically takes us about three to four quarters to get them fully productive after they are onboard. Katy Huberty : Thank you. George Kurian : With regard to what tradeoffs we're going to make, listen we've done a good job making tradeoffs over the last several years. You can see that in our, you know our operating margins and gross margins and will continue to make the appropriate choice of to prioritize our investments into the biggest opportunities.  We think we have a really good portfolio and we think that based on the results we're seeing with our best team, we can deploy more headcount and capture more of the market footprint and so we're going to stay disciplined around that. George Kurian : Thanks Katy. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of Evercore IS. Your line is open. Amit Daryanani : Thanks a lot guys. I guess George, I was hoping to talk a little bit about how do you see the cloud services business ramping up through the fiscal year and you were clearly positive I think on how the Azure ramp has gone, especially for the GA. I was wondering, how would you contrast the Google process as you go forward and how do you think that would be comparable or different, what\u2019s going to happen with Azure, especially given the fact Google I think bought something comparable in Elastifile recently. A - George Kurian : First of all, we are very pleased with the progress of our product services business. It\u2019s up 189% year-over-year and I think the range of things that we see, the differentiation of our technology, the ability to you know migrate big customer workloads in a really cost effective manner to the public cloud and to be able to display its competitive footprint, they are all showing up.  I think with regard to the plan of what we're executing too, it is to qualify more workload and to get deployed into more data centers, that gives us a broader footprint of opportunity to go after. To train the sales force, both the Microsoft sales force and the NetApp sales force around you know selling these technologies in joint ways and that'll take time you know. These are big teams and it takes us time to get all of them trained. So you should expect a ramp through the course of the year getting stronger each quarter as more people are enabled. With regard to Google, you know we think that we have as good an opportunity to migrate customer workloads to the Google cloud. Elastifile is not a competitive product to what we have. It's a commodity offering to compete with the low end file storage service; it's not an enterprise grade file storage service, and so we feel that our opportunity is undiminished.  We are in beta and we are focused on the next step, which is to get the general availability. So far what we see is you know similar pattern of customer trials, testing and so on and so we've done operational readiness with one cloud provider, we're going to work on the second and then as we get to GA we\u2019ll give you more details about it. Amit Daryanani : Perfect! Thanks for the insight. A - George Kurian : Thanks to Amit. Next question? Operator : Next question comes from Steven Fox of Cross Research. Your line is open. Steven Fox : Thanks. Good afternoon and thanks for all the color on the quarter. I'm just struggling a little bit with the assumption that some of the macro weakness is fairly compartmentalized around the large EOMs. Is there any other points or conversations you can point to rather that would say that you don't see further weakness in some smaller customers in Europe and the U.S. Going forward I\u2019m just curious, the confidence level in the macro at this point. Thanks. A - George Kurian : I think that you know our perspective on the macro is very similar to what is reflected in the public commentary on the markets. We saw weakness in certain parts of Europe where GDP growth is challenged. For example, in Germany a little bit and in the UK where the you know sort of ongoing dialogue on Brexit is causing temporary pauses in spending, and then we saw it in the global customers who we do a lot of business with, right.  I think we did not say that the enterprises that were at the next year down weren't exposed to the macro. It's our exposure to a particular customer is a lot lower when they are smaller and we have a diverse book of business in the smaller and mid-sized customers than in the giant global customers. So I would tell you that what we experienced was the combination of macro and the big relationships that we have with some of these large global accounts. Steven Fox : That's helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Thanks Steve. Next question? Operator : Next question comes from Lou Miscioscia of Daiwa Capital Market. Your line is open. Lou Miscioscia : Okay, thank you. I guess George, if you could give us a view as to how I guess you viewed the sales operation since when you came in. I think that if we go back to 2015 when you first started, one of the options I think your predecessors had talked about was materially increasing the sales force, because he viewed that as that would fix some of the problems.  And I guess the question I have and a bit of the difficulty I have is here we are ex number of years later. I realize the macro is very weak, so can fully understand that, but you would think that the sales force would be at a run rate level now, after all these years, that you know you wouldn\u2019t have to go out and either a) increase it and I'm not saying that that's wrong, but also b) that there\u2019s a high level of ones that you talked about in the last call that were not the appropriate productive level. I think we would be at a pretty good steady state.  So if you could just help us understand that and maybe also a milestone or a number. You\u2019re adding 200. I mean how big is the sales force, at least maybe that will help us understand that statistically maybe why there's a couple of issues here, thank you. A - George Kurian : I think first of all you know with regard to the work that we've done in the field organization, as we have said, we have transformed many, many elements of the field organization, particularly by implementing a coverage model that allows us to prioritize our resources against the biggest accounts and the biggest opportunities.  We started the implementation of coverage against the big global account in a more systematic way two to three years ago, which is what drove the results that we had alongside the big global accounts. We don't cover 100% of the largest 2000 to 3000 accounts in the world and we believe given the results that we\u2019ve had, that we have the opportunity by expanding coverage to a broader set of accounts that we can grow our business.  We have also implemented new selling motions right, like covering certain markets through the channel. You saw us restructuring parts of our European organization, so that we could afford the investments in covering the bigger accounts in the bigger countries by moving some of our countries, approximately 15 of them to be served through the channel. We have constructed a joint venture in China together with Lenovo, so that he could participate in the China market in a more efficient fashion.  So we've done a lot of things to change the structure and the composition of the sales force. We think that by adding you know a combination of resources to go after the market, approximately 8% to 10% increase in coverage, we should be able to continue to grow our business in the top line, which is the fundamental issue we've had.  You know if you look at the rest of the P&L, we've had an exceptionally strong result across gross margin, operating margin and all of the other elements of cash generation, and we think that this is specifically a top line issue. We think that by broadening our coverage and footprint, we should be able to mitigate the impact of the macro on a few large customers that today we are exposed to. Lou Miscioscia : Okay, thank you. A - George Kurian : Thanks Lou. Next question? Operator : The next question comes from Tim Long of Barclays. Your line is open. Tim Long : Thank you. If I could just ask kind of a two-parter here on visibility. Obviously what happens last quarter took us a little bit by surprise. Can you just talk a little bit about you know this full year view and how you feel about the second half and did you do some factoring of kind of pipeline like you did for the ELAs in the quarter.  And then just Ron, if you could remind me the visibility into the installed base. I guess that the deferred rose, but we did have you know a decline in a few of the revenue lines, the product services and hardware maintenance. So if you could just flush out for us that installed base view, that would be great. Thank you. Ron Pasek : Okay, so let me start with that one. So you know when you look at maintenance you've got to kind of combine the software maintenance and hardware maintenance together, because we have changed the values associated with each over a period of time, certainly as it relates to the newly installed base.  When you add them together they are down 1% year-over-year and when you adjust for FX they are flat. The fact of the matter is we are growing our installed base of systems under contract and have been for really, for the last eight quarters. So it's actually very healthy what you see reflected for the revenue number. George Kurian : With regard to our outlook for the rest of the year, you know we are not expecting rapid resolution of either the macro or some of the uncertainty around trade and so we factored in a fairly conservative profile and outlook in the overall picture. Either it\u2019s reflective of typical linearity based on a very slow start in Q1 or you know it includes some of the fact that our second half has an easier compare compared to our first half of this year, and so we are not expecting some miraculous rebound in terms of the macro environment.  I think with regard to ELAs, you know as we said ELAs comprise about 2% of the revenue in the year. We don't break it out on a per quarter basis. You should factor in some sort of run rate for ELAs within our broader guidance. Ron Pasek : Just to add to that Tim, remember we have no ELAs in Q1, limited in Q2, so most of the ELAs will happen in the second half, actually it helps with the second half. Tim Long : Okay. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks Tim. Next question? Operator : The next question comes from Jim Suva of Citigroup. Your line is open. Jim Suva : Thanks very much, Ron and George. A quick question for each of you. Ron you just mentioned limited ELAs next quarter and then more in the second half if I heard that correctly, and when you say more in the second half, do we think then about an annual run rate that you've been talking off, or how should we think about the ELAs in the second half.  And then George if you could help us understand, adding 200 sales people in America, that's very good and a couple of quarters to ramp, but I think I heard you say no additional expenses. So how does that work out? Is that just a reallocation or how do you work out more people with no additional costs? Ron Pasek : Yeah, so just on the ELAs, you know I won\u2019t give you the number in Q2 but it\u2019s not huge. Obviously I factored it down, which means that mostly the ELAs will be in the second half. Again to George\u2019s point, we told you that ELAs are roughly 2% of total revenue. So you should expect the majority of that in the second half of the year. George Kurian : With regard to the sales capacity, as I said you know they are not all primary quarter bearing headcount. The majority of the 200 should be quarter bearing headcount, but it\u2019s a combination of frontline quarterbacking headcount, technical resources and management.  We are going to deploy them in a graded fashion over four quarters and you should expect a ramp through those quarters as we get the operational momentum of hiring and all of that in place. It takes three to four quarters as we\u2019ve said consistently for a sales rep to get productive, right and some of these are going to be focused on selling our Private Cloud and Public Cloud portfolios, which have a different business model or profile than a traditional storage system. With regard to how do we expect to hire 200 people and not impact you know operating expensive, I\u2019ll just say we have north of 10,500 people on the company payroll and so we\u2019ll make the appropriate tradeoffs across our broader employee population as we think about people leave the company and you know the shape of people we hire will ship it towards the sales organization, so that we can you know accelerate the turnaround. Jim Suva : Great, thank you so much for the details and clarifications. That\u2019s great, we appreciated it. George Kurian : Thank you, Jim. Kris Newton : Thank you, Jim. Next question? Operator : The next question comes from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Our line is open. Aaron Rakers : Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I want to go back to Amit's question earlier on the Cloud Data Services business. First of all, just a kind of clarification. You know relatively to what you said on the pre-announcement and now today, are you endorsing the fact that you still believe you'll be at that 400-plus million run rate exiting fiscal 21.  And then kind of building on that, one of the comments in the prepared remarks that you know CDS is ramping and there are some elements of cannibalization to the traditional business. I'm trying to understand how you think about that. You know should we consider that as CDS ramps there there's going to be some cannibalization of the traditional on premise business for you guys. Just get any kind of clarification or help on that would be useful. George Kurian : First of all I think we are pleased, with the momentum that we have in the CDS business. We still have the plan to be in the $400 billion to $600 million annual recurring run rate exiting Q4 of fiscal 21, and we are executing to that plan. There's a lot of work that goes into that, but having a leading hyper scalar like Microsoft now generally available is a good benchmark and the next benchmark is to scale them and to get Google Cloud Platform to general availability. So our heads down on executing our game plan.  I think with regard to the base of customer adoption, we feel very good about the early results, right and I think that you should see that ramp through the course of the year. With regard to cannibalization, I would just tell you that you know the fact that NetApp technology is available in the Microsoft Cloud or the Google Cloud, doesn't necessarily mean that the customer is going to move the NetApp workloads first to the cloud. They have a pattern of workloads they want to move to the cloud, we get to participate in a much broader opportunity, as a result of having our technology now being the enterprise platform for both Microsoft and Google, at the expense of our competition, right. That loses every dollar that moves to the cloud, they're going to get zero. We get to participate in two of the biggest hyper-scalers now capturing those workloads onto our platform. Does it on the margin cause some cannibalization? That's already factored into the on-premise business versus the public cloud business forecasts that people have. We just now get to participate in a much more meaningful way in the public cloud business than anybody else. And in some ways that is also helping us now, with new footprint on-premises as customers and now say,\u201d listen, I discovered NetApp in the public cloud. I want to give them a bigger footprint on-prem.\u201d Aaron Rakers : Very helpful, thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks Aaron. Next question? Operator : The next question comes from Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. Your line is open. Ananda Baruah : Good afternoon, I appreciate you taking the questions. Yeah, just going back to AFA, I guess just a two-part for both George and Ron if I could. We'd love to get a sense of, if you're seeing incremental pricing pressure over the last couple of quarters in AFA, even if it's from the customers as the deal sizes have shrunk a bit? And then just sticking with AFA, I'd love to get a sense of if you think that macro aside just industry penetration, the velocity of industry penetration has been slowing at all and your thoughts around that. Thanks a lot. George Kurian : You know, I'll tell you what we saw with our AFA business is that customers bought more of the mid-range configurations and you know bought the capacity that they needed for the next year rather than rightsizing the equipment for a three-year outlook, right? And that is, you know what I would do if I were faced with an uncertain budget environment, so we did see that fairly systematically.  I think with regard to AFA versus the overall storage market, I think that the economics of AFAs compared to hybrid continues to grow and get better, right? If you look at NAND prices, they continue to make AFA a much more attractive value proposition than they were in the past, every quarter, and so if I were a customer, I would continue to prioritize AFA for all by transactional applications. The overall landscape for storage is dependent on the macro, and so I don't see the mix changing. I just look at the overall water level being determined by the macro. Ananda Baruah : Okay, got it. That's helpful. I appreciate the context. Thanks. Kris Newton : Thanks, Ananda. Next question? Operator : The next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi of Lake Street. Your line is open. Eric Martinuzzi : Yeah, I just wanted to clarify, a couple of weeks ago you talked about the shortfall being about two-thirds macro, one-third NetApp-specific. I wanted to make sure that was, you still felt that was the case after a couple of weeks of analysis? And then second part of the question has to do with, you've turned over your EVP, Americas. Wondering if there is any turnover below that senior level, because obviously that would make the adding to the sales more of a back-end loaded 2020 effort. I would think that that might slow things down on the sales hiring. George Kurian : Listen, I think that our analysis leads us to draw the same conclusion, which is its two-third macro, one-third, yes we could have executed better. We did see some exposure from our \u2013 being concentrated in some of the larger accounts, right, and I think that that's consistent.  I want to just say that our leadership team, we wish all of the members of our leadership team well. We have the need to continue to add capacity. That's the fundamental area of focus for us. We'll continue to inspect our business and we'll provide you updates on our execution improvements over time. I'll just leave it there. Eric Martinuzzi : But were there second level turnover, obviously there was at the EVP level, but kind of one level down from that? George Kurian : No. Eric Martinuzzi : Okay, thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, Eric. Next question? Operator : Next question comes for Andrew Vadheim of Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Andrew Vadheim : Thank you. I wanted to follow up on the full-year outlook and what role macro plays. So if you look at 1Q regarding the geographic breakdown of your revs, focusing on EMEA and APAC, 1Q numbers were pretty close to our expectations. And if you link the geographic split back to your full year guide, are you embedding sort of a flat or slightly down EMEA, and APAC for the year. And then uncertainty in Americas gets you to down 10 at the low end to down five at the high-end or does the bottom/top of the range embed a bull-bear case for EMEA and APAC? Ron Pasek : You know I'd rather not go into some of the specific assumptions we made by geo. I think we did look at several things. We looked at what we're seeing in the macro environment in each of those geographies, we talked at the local sales leadership etcetera.  We are making judgments overall, so I can't tell you the exact trade-offs we made, but we are looking at a downsize down 10% for the year. So obviously you'll see that probably most profoundly down in the Americas, kind of given where we are, but beyond that I'm not going to give any other detail. George Kurian : I'll just say I think all of the calculations and factors we considered are you know in the public domain, right, and we use those factors to determine broad-based economic trajectories and then combine that with the judgment and the pipeline data of our sales teams and the historical linearity pattern of our business. Kris Newton : Alright, thank you Andrew. Next question? Operator : Next question comes from Nick Todorov of Longbow Research. Your line is open. Nick Todorov : Hi, thanks for taking the question. You guys talked about customer concentration a couple of times today. Can you give us a little bit more color, maybe an example of how much revenue you\u2019re top 10 or 15 customers account for? George Kurian : We are not going to break that out. I would just say that the impact of what happened during the quarter was primarily due to the fact that some of our largest global accounts that we have very strategic relationships with, you know did not spend anywhere close to what they spent last year. I'll give you an example. We had two large customers that are exposed to the China tariff situation that have cut their capital spending by north of 30% year-on-year. Clearly we are a part of that spending profile and so I would just say that we have really good relationships with the big set of customers and we are planning to broaden those relationships to another broader set of customers over the course of the next year to 18 months. Nick Todorov : Okay. And can I squeeze one more in? Can you remind us how much you have remaining on your buyback authorization? And that'll be from me. Thanks. Ron Pasek : We have $1.6 billion left on the authorization. Nick Todorov : Okay, thanks guys. Good luck. Kris Newton : Thanks Nick. Next question? Operator : Next question comes from Simon Leopold of Raymond James. Your line is open. Simon Leopold : Thank you. During the prepared remarks, you did indicate that you're not seeing any change in the competitive environment. I just wanted to maybe get a better understanding of whether or not we might see the market share shifts as measured by the third party that might reflect differences in geographies or differences in terms of footprint where maybe a competitor might be upgrading its legacy footprint and you've completed that task. Just trying to get a little bit of a better understanding of how you can be confident that it's not about competition and how to square this with third-party research? Thank you. George Kurian : I think that you know what we mean when we say it's not a competitive factor is that our win rates in competitive transactions remains the same. Our product gross margins were up 280 basis points year-on-year when you adjust for ELAs, which shows the strength of our differentiation, right?  I think there may be differences in how the results play out for different providers depending on their customer basis. We did see exposure from our biggest customers not buying as much, right? And I think that what we are convinced off is that if we expand our footprint and broaden our customer coverage, given the strength of the performance we've had in the places where we saw you know budget available and our ability to win competitive transactions, we should be able to broaden our book of business and reduce the effects of customer concentration. Simon Leopold : Thank you for the clarification. Kris Newton : Thank you, Simon. Next question? Operator : Next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of SIG. Your line is open. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes, I have two follow-ups. Ron, if I were just to look at your guide for the October quarter operating margin, it seems to me that OpEx would actually go up by $10 million to $15 million. Is that a fair assumption? Ron Pasek : Yeah, I mean, it goes up as a function of revenue, sure. Mehdi Hosseini : Okay, so just going back to the comment of adding additional sales people, this OpEx is just nature of the revenue and nothing to do with the recent months. Ron Pasek : Yes. You won't see a huge impact to OpEx in the quarter for the hiring, it takes a while to get people onboard. You'll see some increase is baked in there, but most of that's just a function of the linearity throughout the year, linear revenues and the headcount structure. So. Mehdi Hosseini : Sure. I just have a quick follow-up to the AFA question I asked earlier. Your comments suggested there is a high-teen decline in AFA revenue, FY'20 versus FY '19. But as I look at the back half of this FY\u201920, I see a nice rebound driven by the migration of the 10 K-RPM to SSD, and that should build momentum into calendar year \u2013 into the fiscal year '21. Is that a fair assumption as to what could drive a rebound in AFA? George Kurian : I think first of all, what we said was it was reflective of Q1 results, Q1 FY '20 over Q1 FY '19 being down in the high teens, right?  I think with regard to the rest of the year, I'm not going to break out AFA versus HFA. I think that AFA is advantaged on a whole bunch of dimensions and should continue to get a bigger share of the pie of storage relative to HFA than it was in prior years, just because of NAND economics, QLC, all kinds of things.  I think we will continue to use every opportunity we can to drive transitions of disk-based systems and hybrid-based systems to our flash systems. The pace of those upgrades is a combination of, yes, good technology being available, but also budget cycles being available.  And so we're going to lean in on the technology side and give customers every opportunity to upgrade. But we'll have to wait to see how the macro plays out, to see how many of those budget cycles are available. Mehdi Hosseini : Got it. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you. Mehdi. I'll now pass it back to George for a couple of closing comments. George Kurian : Thanks, Kris. I'm disappointed in our weaker than expected top line results, but I remain confident that we have the right strategy and technology to address the key market transition. We have a strong business model, as a result of the hard work we conducted to improve gross margin and cost structure over the last several years.  Our continued strong cash generation is a great example of the underlying health of our business. We will remain fiscally disciplined with our expenditures, while still investing for the long-term health of the business, and we remain committed to our capital allocation policy of returning cash to shareholders through share buybacks and a quarterly dividend. The robust fundamentals of our business enable us to navigate the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds and make the strategic moves that position us to return to growth.  I hope to see you at the Investors session of our Annual Insight User Conference on October 29 in Las Vegas. Thank you again. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. You may disconnect your lines at this time.",

My name is Andrew and I will be your conference call coordinator for today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. I will now turn the call over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Please proceed, Ms. Newton. Kris Newton : Thank you for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Ron Pasek. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our Web site at netapp.com. During today's call we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects such as our guidance for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2020. Our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability, and shareholder returns and our ability to improve execution, gain share, reaccelerate growth and expand our sales capacity without increasing total operating expenses, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially for a variety of reasons including macroeconomic and market conditions, the IT capital spending environment and our ability to expand our total available market, acquire new accounts, expand in existing accounts, capitalize on our data fabric strategy, improve the consistency of our sales execution and continue our capital allocation strategy. Please also refer to the documents we filed from time-to-time with the SEC and available on our Web site, specifically our most recent Form 10-K for fiscal year 2019 including the Management's Discussion Analysis of financial condition and results of operations and risk factor sections and our Current Reports on Form 8-K. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of the GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are posted on our Web site. I'll now turn the call over to George. George Kurian : Thanks Kris. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Our Q2 FY'20 results reflect the strength of our business model and the value of our innovation. We delivered gross margin, operating margin and EPS all solidly above our guidance ranges. Despite the ongoing macro economic uncertainty and the potential for continuing unpredictability in enterprise purchasing behavior, the fundamentals of our business are strong. I've just come from two great events, NetApp Insight and Microsoft Ignite and the many conversations I had with customers, prospects and partners both underscore the power of our data fabric strategy to differentiate our solution and highlight our success in reaching new customers and buying centers to expand our market share. At this year's Insight user conference, it was clear that we are solving real pain points for customers as they grapple with the complexity of hybrid multicloud IT. I witnessed the tangible enthusiasm for how we are helping customers address these challenges by building their own data fabric with net app. I'm sure those of you who were able to join us felt that excitement. We saw an increase in overall attendance and for almost half of the customer attendees, this was their first Insight. The number of executive level customers was up 80% from last year and the number of customers with cloud responsibilities doubled. Hybrid multicloud is the reality of customer's IT environment and NetApp has the strategy, the innovation portfolio and customer experience to help them succeed. At Insight, we announced that we are revolutionizing the customer experience and simplifying the business of hybrid multicloud with NetApp Keystone. NetApp Keystone creates a consistent experience from public cloud to the data center helping customers transform IT to operate with cloud like ease and flexibility everywhere. First, for customers who want truly elastic scaling without having to manage infrastructure, they can consume NetApp technology as a cloud service through the world's biggest public clouds. Second, for customers who want a cloud like experience on-premises, we offer subscription services and finally for customers who want to own and operate technology in their own data centers, we've introduced a radically simplified ownership experience for how our customers buy, optimize and grow with NetApp. Customers and partners choose NetApp because of our unique ability to offer a full range of capabilities needed to build their data fabric. NetApp Keystone compliments this with a consistent cloud like customer experience across the public cloud and on-premises. Let me be clear. Our approach to cloud is giving us access to new buyers and workloads as well as increasing the relevance of NetApp to companies both large and small. Cloud gives us both opportunity in the public cloud and makes us more attractive for on-premises deployments. While I'm heartened by the enthusiasm generated by our hybrid cloud data services, the headwinds we identified a last quarter's call persisted through Q2. Both macro economic and enterprise spending indicators show continued weakness. While we cannot predict when conditions will improve, we are planning our business assuming no change in these external factors for the foreseeable future. I'm pleased with our sales discipline and the ability to capture value in this tough market. To that point, our product gross margins demonstrate that we were able to maintain pricing discipline despite the soft environment. Regardless of what is happening in the broader macro environment, I remain confident that we can return to growth because of our ability to deliver real business value to customers hybrid multicloud environment. This increases our strategic relevance and enables us to reach new buyers through new pathways, address new workloads, and expand our presence with existing customers. To better capitalize on our opportunity and replicate our proven areas of success, we laid out a plan for you last quarter that includes increasing sales capacity by approximately 200 primary sales resources by the end of Q1 FY'21 without adding to the total operating expenses for the company. As of the end of Q2, we are well on track to deliver against this goal. The sales headcount will be deployed primarily in our America's geography. They bring capabilities to acquire new accounts as well as engage new buyers with new sources of funding like cloud architects and existing accounts. As a reminder, we expected to take roughly three to four quarters to bring these resources up to full productivity and the vast majority of the benefit of this additional capacity will be realized next year in fiscal year '21. We are also sharpening our attack on the key market transitions of this to flash, traditional IT architectures to private cloud and on-premises to public cloud. In Q2 our all-flash array business inclusive of all-flash FAS, EF and SolidFire products and services was up 29% sequentially to an annualized net revenue run rate of $2.2 billion. We have industry leading guaranteed storage efficiency, the highest performance and the most complete cloud integration in the market today. In the quarter, Gartner published its Magic Quadrant for primary storage and NetApp took the highest ranking in the leader's quadrant for both our ability to execute and for the completeness of our vision. Moving to our private cloud solution. SolidFire, NetApp HCI and StorageGRID are the building blocks for private cloud deployments and enabling customers to bring public cloud like experience and economics into their data centers. Our private cloud business inclusive of products and services, a chained and annualized net revenue run rate of over $300 million in the second quarter up almost 30% year-over-year. Now onto cloud data services. Based on the last month of Q2, our annualized recurring revenue for cloud data services increased to approximately $72 million up 167% year-over-year. We continue to see a healthy mix of customers new to NetApp in our cloud services and expect that our cloud services will continue to enable us to acquire new customers, reach new buyers, and expand the workload's managed at existing customers. Q2 is the first full quarter that Azure NetApp files has been generally available and we're making great progress. At Microsoft Ignite, I spoke to many customers who are planning to move a broad range of enterprise workloads like Oracle and SAP into the Azure cloud with Azure NetApp files. Customers love that they get the widest choice of file protocols and on-premises class performance and availability within Azure consistent experience from procurement to support to billing. A global energy company that's migrating high-performance workloads into the cloud for flexibility, scalability, global access and collaboration presented at Ignite about their experience with Azure NetApp files. The performance improvements they achieved are outstanding, simulation run times were reduced from months to days and in some cases hours. To quote the customer 'Azure NetApp file is a lifesaver' and that's just one example of the excitement we hearing from customers about what we're doing in the cloud. Our cloud volume services available in all three leading hyperscalers and gives us access to new opportunities from non-enterprise customers where our traditional solutions do not economically reach to new strategic buying centers in the world's largest enterprises where we are only a small part of their infrastructure, we are expanding addressable market with our cloud data services. Our many years of work and deep integration with the leading public clouds give us a sustainable competitive advantage in the hybrid multicloud. We're delivering an enormous amount of value to a growing number of customers, operating and planning to operate in a hybrid multicloud world. We're adding new customers each day. We're adding new use cases each week and we're adding new cloud regions each month to deliver the world's best hybrid cloud data services. As I've said before, customers and partners are choosing NetApp because of our data fabric strategy and our unique relationship with the hyperscale cloud providers. Our cloud data services not only give us access to customers and workloads that work heretofore inaccessible with our traditional solutions. They improve our competitive position for on-premises opportunities. Only Net app has the strategy, innovation portfolio and customer experience to help customers succeed in hybrid multicloud IT. We've made a lot of progress in delivering on our data fabric strategy. Our on-premises solutions are highly differentiated as evidenced by a strong product gross margin. We are now available in the three leading clouds. We have delivered both the technology and the customer experience needed for success in the hybrid multicloud and we are improving our execution and adding demand generation resources to drive new sales motion, but it is early days and we have more work to do to communicate the full scope of our capabilities as we saw it inside in Ignite, our story resonates with customers, because of this, I am confident in our ability to return to growth. We will continue to return capital to shareholders while investing for the long-term health of the business and capitalizing on our unique ability to help customers navigate the complexities of the hybrid multicloud. Before closing, I want to share some news about our organization. Henri Richard, Executive Vice President for Worldwide Customer and Field Operations has left me know of his intent to retire at the end of the fiscal year. Over the past 3.5 years at NetApp, Henri has done much to transform and modernize our sales force to take advantage of the strength of our data fabric strategy and our technology leadership as we pivoted to new buying centers and the growth areas of the market. Henri will participate in the search for his replacement and help in a seamless transition while continuing to lead the field and improving our execution. At the same time, I'm excited to announce the promotion of James Whitemore to Senior Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer. James came to NetApp in the SolidFire acquisition where he was CMO and has since been leading our demand generation and digital strategy in the marketing organization. As acting CMO, James has already made a strong impact and I'm glad to have him as the CMO of NetApp. With that, I'll turn it over to Ron for more details on the quarter and our expectations. Ron? Ron Pasek : Thanks, George. Good afternoon to everyone and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. As George highlighted, in Q2, we delivered strong margins and operating leverage in the face of continued caution from our customers as a result of the macro environment. Despite the demand uncertainty, we are confident in our product leadership and strategy to reaccelerate growth going forward. We also remain committed to our capital allocation strategy of returning cash to shareholders through share buybacks and our healthy quarterly dividends. Before discussing our guidance, I'll provide further detail on our Q2 performance. In Q2 net revenues of $1.371 billion were down 10% year-over-year, including 1 point of currency headwind. We had zero ELA revenue in the quarter compared to roughly 20 million of ELA revenue in Q2 '19, product revenue of $771 million decreased approximately 16% year-over-year. Adjusting for ELAs, Q2 total revenue would've been down approximately 8% and product revenues would have been down approximately 14%. Moving down the P&L, software maintenance and hardware maintenance revenue of $540 million was flat year-over-year. Deferred revenue increased 8% year-over-year in Q2. Gross margin of 68.6% was above the high-end of our guidance range. Product gross margin was 57.3%, which is an increase of 3.2 points year-over-year and above our long-term target of 56% outlined at our Analyst Day. The improvement was driven by continued sales force discipline and increase in all-flash product mix and cost reductions and includes nearly a 0.5 of currency headwinds. Q2 was the 11th straight quarter, we increased product margins year-over-year when adjusting for the benefit of ELAs. The combination of software and hardware maintenance and other services, gross margin, 83% increased by over 150 basis points year-over-year driven by continued productivity improvements. Q2 operating expenses of $631 billion were down 3% year-over-year driven primarily by a reduction in variable compensation. Operating margin was 22.5% solidly above the high-end of our guidance range. Despite the revenue headwinds, EPS of a $1.09 was up 3% year-over-year and above the high-end of our guidance demonstrating the operating leverage in our business model. We closed Q2 with $3 billion in cash in short-term investments. Our cash conversion cycle was a negative four days up 15 days, year-over-year. DSO of 52 days was up six days, year-over-year due to linearity in the quarter and to a lesser extent customer mix. DIO was 23 days, a nine day increase year-over-year. We continued to expect our cash conversion cycle to remain negative throughout fiscal 2020. Cash flow from operations was a negative $53 million, while free cash flow was a negative $89 million. The negative Q2 cashflow metrics are due to timing and do not reflect a change in our underlying business. The timing issues were primarily the accounts receivable. Additionally, there is a shift in the linearity of cash tax payments in FY'20. We are maintaining our expectations for free cashflow to be in the range of 19% to 21% of revenues in fiscal 2020. During Q2, we repurchased 9.8 million shares at an average price of $51.19 for a total of $500 million. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 236 million down 28 million shares year-on-year representing an 11% decrease. During the quarter, we paid out $111 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $611 million to shareholders in the quarter. Our fiscal Q3 cash dividend will be $0.48 per share. Now onto guidance. We expect revenues for fiscal 2020 to be down approximately 8% year-over-year. We continue to expect ELAs to represent approximately 2% of total revenue. For fiscal 2020, we now expect gross margin to be in the range of 67% to 68% above our previous guidance of 66% to 67% due primarily to the improvement in product margin. Operating margin for fiscal 2020 is expected to be in the range of 21% to 22% Implied in this guidance, is our expectation that operating expenses will be down slightly year-over-year in fiscal 2020 due to lower variable compensation. As a result of the updated revenue and margin guidance, we expect EPS to be down between 5% and 8% year-over-year without the benefit of buybacks. Now on to Q3 guidance. We expect Q3 net revenues to range between $1.39 billion and $1.54 billion, which at the midpoint implies a 6% decline in revenues year-over-year, including a 0.5 of currency headwind. For Q3, we expect consolidated gross margin to be approximately 67% and operating margin to be approximately 22%. We expect earnings per share for the quarter to range between $1.14 and $1.22 per share. We are diligently focused on improved execution and addressing the challenges we face. We are committed to returning the company to growth and we remain confident, our business model leverage will enable us to deliver long-term shareholder returns. With that, I'll hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris? Kris Newton : Thanks, Ron. We will now open the call for Q&A. We ask that you'd be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to one question, so we can get to as many people as possible. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you. Your product gross margins is north of 57% have been very strong, we have not seen that in a while actually since 2015. Can you talk about how much of that product gross margin was product mix driven versus commodity price tailwinds or maybe even federal mix? And do you feel that you can sustain or expand these margins as you go into the back half of the year? Ron Pasek : Yes, Wamsi. Good question. On a year-over-year basis, most of it was mixed meaning we saw a higher percent this quarter of all-flash that we did say last quarter. Some of that was also cost reduction, not just on other things as well. That was in the face of having ELAs in the quarter. That goes against you. I did contemplate the ability to keep this level of gross margin through the rest of fiscal year and you saw that in the increase of the total margin guide. Wamsi Mohan : Okay, great. Thanks. And if I could really quickly on CDS, you exited last quarter with 5 million in monthly sales, seems like you exited this quarter with about 6 million despite Azure [indiscernible] quarter. Can you talk about, what are some of the challenges and not ramping this faster and I know George you expressed a lot of enthusiasm and all of your discussions with that Insight that big night? So, where do you expect CDS annualized revenue run rate could be as you exit fiscal '20. Thank you. George Kurian : We aren't going to give you guidance on the CDS business. I think as we said, we've taken longer than we originally expected to get to general availability given the technical sophistication of what we are offering to customers. The total addressable market is there. We are seeing a lot of demand and interest from customers and we're adding customers and growing footprints on a daily basis. We are going to just need to keep doing the work necessary to scale and enable all of the pathways associated with being able to take the solution to market and to replicate the wins that we've got across a broad range of workloads into more customers. So, we're focused on execution at this point. Wamsi Mohan : Thank you. Kris Newton : All right. Thanks, Wamsi. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Rod Hall : Yes. Thanks for the questions. I wanted to just check and see Ron, if you could comment on the accounts receivable and while the DSOs, the far highest we've seen, I think ever in our models. So just, I heard you say the tail end of the -- it was heavily back end loaded in the quarter, but any more color on that? And then the ELAs you're holding this 2% guide yet, there are no ELA so far. So just anything you can say that would help us all have more confidence that you've got visibility into that or are you still having to run on a treadmill to get them deals? Just kind of help us understand, why you still have confidence in that ELA guide. Thanks. RonPasek: So, with respect to AR, it was linearity within the quarter and particularly within the month. And then to a lesser extent some of the mix of customers we saw that bought in the last two months of the quarter. You saw a similar phenomenon in Q4 where we added a pretty back end loaded. And of course, collected all of that AR in Q1, which yielded a bunch of cashflow. It happens sometimes. The other issue with free cashflow and cashflow, which I mentioned in my script was larger cash tax payments. But I did reiterate the full year guidance 19% to 21% for free cash flow as a percent of revenue. With respect to ELAs, I'll make a comment and let George comment as well. Last year, this quarter we ended up giving you a full year guide of roughly 2% of revenue, we've to understand that we can't easily contemplate when those ELAs come in within each quarter. But for the full year we felt comfortable with that. We did that based on extensive conversations with parts of the sales force, making sure they understood the importance of this and the fact that it has a huge impact on earnings because it's essentially pure profit. So, that was the further conversation this quarter and it led to the continued commitment for the second half. George Kurian : With regard to ELAs, Rod, I think the fundamental thing that we are doing with them is to enable streamlined customer purchasing. It doesn't require them to spend the whole amount of the ELA upfront. It's really to make their overall multiyear procurement agreements with us a lot more streamlined and to enable us to get a broader strategic footprint in the account. We know these accounts, some of them have intending events that this would clearly enable things to get more streamlined. And so, we're working in, right? We have visibility into these accounts. We know who these accounts are and we're working hard to bring this forward. Rod Hall : Okay. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, Rod. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Karl Ackermann with Cowen. Karl Ackermann : Hey, good afternoon. Thank you for letting me ask question. Towards Ron, if I may going back to your outlook for December, it seems you are employing a not all-flash rate business will decline about 6% sequentially. That seems to be about in line with the seasonal averages of near line drives, but at the same time to have your hard drive suppliers have spoken about improved nearline shipments in December and for the first half of 2020 you know, when you also launched two new mid-range hybrid range at Insight. So, I don't know competitive forces impeding your ability to do a bit better in hybrid raise for the next few quarters or is he just conservative too? Thank you. George Kurian : So, I'm not really sure I understand your question. We guiding total revenue. We're not even specific product revenue and within that, not all-flash. So, I'm not sure, I quite understand where you're going with that. But we feel good about our position in the hybrid array market. We are without question across a range of customer and analyst surveys, the best hybrid array vendor. We've introduced two new models. I think what we are framing up for the next quarter guide is really an overall product number. We're not forecasting it to the level of specific product components at this point. Karl Ackerman : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, Karl. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. George, I want to go back to the topic of installed base. In the past you've talked about installed base that is only penetrated in the teens. So how do you see, especially in the context of a strong AFA results for the October quarter? Thank you. George Kurian : We are up a few percentage points. We're up at 22% of the installed base now being on AFA. As we've said before, our installed base is growing and so while we ship a lot of new systems each quarter, the size and scope of the installed base and its growth leaves the total AFA penetration at a small number which allows us to have opportunity to continue to refresh over time the rest of the installed base. Mehdi Hosseini : Sure. Thank you. Just one clarification, if I may. Would end of life support for ONTAP 7 actually help, expedite or increase the penetration rate? George Kurian : Some of those customers that have not upgraded so far, there is a small number. But certainly, some of those if they look at the economics today of a platform like our C190, they would choose to go all-flash than go to a 10K disk-based system, because the economics are already better with our solutions to replace 10K drives. Mehdi Hosseini : Great. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, Mehdi. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I'm just kind of want to understand a little bit on the guidance side. It would appear based on the gross margin guidance in the current quarter that you're not obviously factoring in ELA. I think last time, it's like a 400-basis point benefit that you saw in product gross margin. So, if that's true, and we kind of think about the setup going into the April quarter, it's kind of hit the full-year guidance level. Number one are you factoring in a revenue contribution to kind of hit an absolute increase in revenue in the April quarter that includes an ELA and therefore we should also be thinking that the gross margin into that April quarter is significantly higher, just because that ELA contribution would fall into that, if you kind of hit that 2% of total revenue for the full year or is that just not factored into your guidance at all. I'm trying to understand how you kind of think about the mechanics of the implied guidance at the April quarter? Ron Pasek : Yes. So, remember, as we go through the fiscal year this for Q3 and Q4, product revenue becomes a larger part of the total, which overall is dilutive to overall margin, right? So, you can't just look at the numbers that you're holding total margin flat to Q3 therefore, you don't have an ELA, because of mix of product versus services is higher in Q3 obviously. So, there is some ELA in Q3 and there are absolutely some in Q4. Aaron Rakers : Okay. And on an absolute basis, April quarter versus what you've done over the past few years. I think early '18 the storage market was fairly healthy. So, I'm just trying -- you have a line of sight that says, look on the absolute sequential basis, you can kind of, see that kind of jump that you saw back in 2018 or is there something else that I'm just not thinking about in the model? Ron Pasek : Well, again, you've got the benefit of ELAs in Q3 and Q4 which you didn't have essentially last year Q3, Q4 to a great extent. That helps in all the things meaningful. Aaron Rakers : Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. Kris Newton : All right. Thanks, Aaron. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Good afternoon. EMEA was stronger than other segments. Can you talk about whether that was your own execution, or did you see some improvement in the market and then just generally speaking, can you comment on the spending environment relative to the caution that you highlighted in the first quarter in the major segments? Thanks. George Kurian : We saw Q2 relatively unchanged from Q1. And as we said at the start of the year, Q1 was a step down from calendar Q1 which was our fiscal Q4 of last year, but there were no major changes overall in terms of the trajectory from Q1 in terms of spending. Customers continue to be cautious. They are scrutinizing transactions. They're buying for what they need today and the differentiation for offerings is clearly visible in the fact that our gross margins were really, really strong. With regard to EMEA, our teams have done a really good job and I want to salute our sales teams, there is a lot of execution that has been a big part of our strength in EMEA. Kris Newton : All right. Thanks, Katy. Next question. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. Matt Cabral : Thank you. The services business was down a touch if you put together both hardware and software. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about where you are in addressing some of the renewal issues that you highlighted on prior calls and just how we should think about a return to growth for services going forward? Ron Pasek : So, we've made some progress. You can see that we're essentially flat when you adjust for FX. We still have some work to do. There is some organizational work we're doing. There is some process work we're doing. You can't see that yet manifested itself in growth, but as George indicated the installed base is growing and we believe that eventually we will get back to growth as well. And you can see that in the deferred revenue number. So, it's not going backwards, which is good as it did in Q4 of last year, but we still have some work to do. Matt Cabral : Got it. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, Matt. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kurtz with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Alex Kurtz : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. George on the last call, it seems like the sales force productivity issue was really the main driver to the reset, and I'm sure we touched on macro in that call, but it just seemed like that was really the focus from the team. So then fast forward 90 days and you seem very optimistic about the hiring of the new reps and I just wonder what gives you the confidence, 90 days later, because it seemed like it was a pretty big step back internally as far as how the team is working, but maybe we were overestimating that and maybe things were as difficult to kind of fix as far as hiring productive reps and ramping them? George Kurian : Listen, what we said on the Q1 call was that the quarterly results reflected two-thirds macro, one-thirds sales execution. And so, it was a reflection of the macro in the purchasing behavior of our largest customers that drove the majority of the impact in Q1. We've always believed that our portfolio is really strong and given our position in the market, we have ample room to capture more accounts and to invest some of the really strong gross margin leverage that we're seeing into investment in field sales coverage. We've always believed, our story is differentiated in the market. We're doing exciting things and we are an attractive place to work. So, we've been pleasantly surprised with our ability to hire good quality salespeople and we're focused on getting them productive and ramping them. I think I would just say we are heads down and focused on execution. Q2 saw an improvement relative to Q1 in terms of our ability to execute and capture the deals in front of us. We got to keep doing that. And I expect us to continue to do that through the course of the year. Alex Kurtz : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, Alex. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : Thanks for taking my question guys. I guess, Ron, you're taking up gross margins fairly notably for fiscal '20. Structurally, I'm wondering, do you think 67% plus gross margin that's something that's sustainable long-term? Or was there some specific benefits of it maybe more one-time in nature in fiscal '20 versus longer term? How do we just think about the levers that are enabling this upside? And then George, how do you think about Dell's upcoming mid-range solution and what that could do from a pricing or competitive basis for you guys? Ron Pasek : So, Amit, I think if you look at where we are in the quarter and then implied in some of the guide for the rest of the year, we are at the model we articulated at our Analyst Day for product margins 1.5 year ago. So, we said 55% at that point after the 606 change, I said 56% to 57%. And so, yes, I believe it's completely sustainable. It's a good 10 points below one of our competitors who is an all-flash competitor. It's 10 points above where we were two years ago so it's a really good place to be and it gives us a lot of flexibility to still be aggressive, but not under earn. George Kurian : With regard to your comment about Dell EMC, we feel very good about our solution set. We are seen by Gartner and customers as the leader for Primary Storage and we are the only vendor in the market with a comprehensive cloud strategy. And so, we feel good about our position in the market and we are going to capitalize on it, which is why we are investing in sales capacity to go capture net new accounts and expand wallet share within existing accounts. Amit Daryanani : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks Amit. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Vadheim with Wolfe Research. Andrew Vadheim : Hi. Thank you. I wanted to follow-up on a prior question and how it relates to guidance. So, you mentioned the weakness you're seeing and sort of deteriorating macroeconomic environment, but I'm just wondering why you decided then tightened the full-year guide especially on revenue kind of taking it from a 5-point range to 1-point estimate? Ron Pasek : I think when you think about the guide, we have two quarters of actuals and guiding Q3 discreetly. So, you essentially have three of the four quarters. I think it would be strange to keep the same 5% to 10% down when in fact we kind of know where we think we'll be in Q4. Remember Q4 last year is a relatively easy compare, we were down 3%. So, getting to that number should not be that difficult whereas the first half of this year was much more difficult compare. Couple that with effect that we have ELAs in the second half, we didn't have in the first half just felt like it was a better thing to do. Andrew Vadheim : Okay, thanks. And then separately, public sector was kind of down sequentially. Just was wondering to what extent that was expected and should we think of public sector sort of being in line with the rest of the company on a year-over-year growth basis and sort of Q3 and 4Q? George Kurian : You know over the last year or two, we started to shift the mix of our public sector business to be more program-related and broaden the book of business beyond just the fed to state, local and higher education and other parts of the market. As a result, you will see the business trend toward more of a standard pattern as opposed to a big step up in Q2. Andrew Vadheim : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, Andrew. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon Leopold : Thanks. I wanted to see if we could touch a little bit on what you're seeing in the macro environment given what we've heard from others reporting tonight. It sounds to me that maybe you saw some of the deterioration of enterprise demand a little bit earlier. And so, this is more of an issue of timing. And what I'm really looking for from you is, how the demand has maybe evolved or changed over the course of the quarter versus what you talked about in August. Is the weakness shifting among verticals, steady, how is it changed? Thank you. George Kurian : I think in aggregate, we did not see a material change in Q2 from what we saw in Q1. With regard to the exposure of specific verticals and so on, we have a broad book of business. We wouldn't say that we are exposed to any particular vertical to be able to comment specifically about it. I would say it's reflective of the news that you see in the market, right? And there are teams in countries like Germany where the spending pattern is tight, who are executing really, really well for us. And we did see some slowdowns in other parts of the world, but nothing that's unique to NetApp. And our view is, Q2 is reflective of a more stable long-term pattern that we see in the market and it is a materially changed from Q1 and that's what we're planning our business around. To capture the value from our differentiated offerings by being disciplined on price and extracting the value that we feel we deserve, and then investing some of that benefit from gross margin and operating margin leverage into the quarter bearing sales capacity that we talked about last time. And we feel that the combination of the two should allow us to bring -- get our business back to growth over time and continue to deliver the earnings model and returns to shareholders that we've committed to. Simon Leopold : Thanks. Just to clarify one thing. Did you see seasonal strength in the federal vertical in the most recent quarter that sets up a tougher sequential comp in the January quarter, is that material for you? Thanks. George Kurian : Our book of business in the public sector market is increasingly broad. We have diversified our book of business to be deployable in program spending, which is not driven by any specific seasonality pattern. We are growing our footprint in state and local governments, so the public sector business had its normal year end pattern, but the Fed business is a smaller component of our overall public sector business. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the questions. Kris Newton : Thanks, Simon. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer. George Iwanyc : Thank you for taking my question. George, you continue to be pretty bullish on adding new customers, especially with your cloud offerings. Can you give us a sense of whether that's share displacement there, primarily new workloads and is that transitioning over to some traditional storage sales as well? George Kurian : We are certainly seeing a broad range of workloads being deployed on our cloud solutions, ecommerce, databases like Oracle and SAP HANA which are high-performance transactional workloads. We see genetics and bio science applications, vertical applications for oil and gas and healthcare. So, really broad set of applications that require consistent performance and high-availability. And I think that's what we are uniquely positioned in the cloud for. There are customers and many that are saying that, listen, if you're going to use you in the cloud, we want to harmonize our on-premises environment, so that we can move workloads between the two landscapes. And with our announcement of Keystone, a subscription service for on-premises environments, we can now have not only the technology that allows them to standardize workload models between on-prem and public cloud, but the customer experience and the consumption offering that allows them to do that. George Iwanyc : All right. And just expanding on your Keystone comments. How long do you think the selling motion will take to get that up and running? George Kurian : I think that, listen, we don't believe that Keystone subscription services will replace CapEx purchasing, right? We think it will be a part of what customers want for their IT landscape. We are doing the work to enable our sales teams to be able to position that offering in the right way into customers and we think it will take time. We'll give you updates as we go. With regard to our business model, we hold the assets on our books. You see depreciation, similar to what were in the P&L we have, we report cloud data services depreciation, right? So, it's not going to be material this year. George Iwanyc : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, George. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup. Jim Suva : Thanks very much. And George, you've been very vocal about hiring more sales. And can you just remind us of the cadence, is it kind of higher during six months trained relationships, we're growing in six-month after. So, we're kind of looking at fiscal kind of '21 or kind of summer of next year always said the fruit really starts to bear from these efforts. Is that the right timeline or I might be off on that? George Kurian : Just to go back to what we said. We said that we were going to hire 200 incremental demand generation headcount over four quarters with the last quarter being Q1 of fiscal '21 and we are on track. It takes three to four quarters to train a rep and to get them to full productivity. So, we think that the predominant benefit of this additional capacity will be in fiscal '21. Jim Suva : Great. Thank you so much for the clarification. It's greatly appreciated. Kris Newton : Thank you, Jim. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Lou Miscioscia with Daiwa Capital. Lou Miscioscia : Okay. Thank you. So, two questions sort of combined together. One of the things about the sales force, you said a good portion of the sales force wasn't selling the entire product line, given obviously the relationships they have there. I assume this is just more of a reeducation and maybe some adjusting to the sales plan. I'm just wondering, how is that actually happening? How is it going? And then, combined with that maybe this is part of it obviously flash improved significantly on a quarter-to-quarter basis, just you went through some of the impacts last quarter, but how did you get flash bouncing back so quickly this quarter? George Kurian : I want to credit the field organization for focus and execution, right? I think we said that what we were going to do was to focus on the big market transitions just to flash, traditional IT to public private cloud and the deployment of enterprise workloads in public clouds sort of the key areas where we would attack the market and I think credit to the sales leadership and the sales force for the progress in all-flash. With regard to the comments you made earlier about our ability to sell the full portfolio, what we observe is that there are different buyers for some of our portfolio than the traditional storage buyer. Cloud architects, DevOps, staff and workload owners like application owners, we have been focused on reaching them and bringing them to our user conference, we saw a substantial uplift in the number of people from those pedigrees coming to our user conference, reflecting both the success of our field and marketing teams and reaching them over time, as well as the interest that we have in our portfolio, right? So, we need specific competency to go after those types of sales motions and we're bringing that into the company as part of our 200 headcount. And of course, we're focused on training the storage focused sales force on expanding their relevance to some of these new audiences. So, work is under way as I said we're heads down in executing against these three imperatives. We saw the benefit of that focus in Q2 and we're going to continue to stay laser focused on that through the rest of the year. Lou Miscioscia : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Lou. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Ananda Baruah : Hi. Thanks guys for taking the questions. Ron, George. George, at your last Analyst Day, you guys talked about mid-single digit revenue growth. Now that you're getting the sales force, sort of call it reoptimized, I mean maybe reoptimized to think from the adding. Does the optimization process put you in the position longer term to give stronger revenue growth, if your marketplace optimize? And then just real quick Ron, I believe you had some ELA expectation in the results for the quarter. So, and you basically did in revenues. So, do you outperform your internal product revenue targets for the quarter? Thanks guys. Thank you. George Kurian : So, I think that we have many avenues to grow our business. We have a leading position in Primary Storage on-premises. We have a growing private cloud business and we are the only storage vendor who can support enterprise workloads in all of the major public clouds. And so, I feel like we have plenty of total addressable market. We are focused on getting the company back on track to growth, right? And we'll tell you more about our long-term earnings model the next time we hold an Analyst Day. I will just tell you that we have delivered on all of the elements of commitments we made in terms of gross margins and operating margins and so on and barring the slowdown in enterprise spending this year, we were on track to meet even the top-line numbers that we had committed. So, we feel strongly about delivering on our commitments. Right now we are entirely focused on executing against the opportunities in front of us and getting the company back to growth and digital sales headcount funded by the strong margin profile of our business is the first step, getting them on board productive and all of that's the focus of the company right now. Ron? Ron Pasek : And Ananda, you're right. I did and mention in the Q2 guide, we had factored in some amount of ELA which of course did not come through. And it was essentially the entire miss to the midpoint. It simply flaps into Q3. So yes, we've had sector where we thought with the exception that one ELA. Ananda Baruah : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Kris Newton : Thanks, Ananda. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nehal Chokshi with Maxim Group. Nehal Chokshi : Yes. Thank you. So, really nice net new cloud ARR within the quarter of $11 million, which compares to $7 million in the year ago quarter. So that's very strong net new ARR growth. Is that all -- as they are files driven or sales capacity driven or something else? George Kurian : The majority of our growth in cloud data services is from Microsoft Azure NetApp Files. We saw -- and the majority of that revenue is from net new customers, right? So, we don't have a single large customer that's a big percentage of the total number. We are seeing good momentum across a broad range of use cases and a broad range of customers trying things out and deploying their first workloads. So, as we go forward, we are focused both on continuing to acquire new customers, but additionally to expand our footprints now that we've got success in some of these customers to broader sets of workloads. So, thank you for that. Nehal Chokshi : And if I may. My understanding is that you do have some specialists trying to sell cloud data services. Although, I believe also the broader sales force is also capable. So, in the cloud services. What's the sourcing of this new cloud ARR between these two sales forces? George Kurian : It's hard for me to comment on that. I think we've got multiple pathways into the market. We've got both specialists and generalists within our field who are focused on selling cloud data services as part of their remits. And we have the Microsoft pathway into market, which we are continuing to work to enable around the use cases and the expanding number of use cases of our technology. So, it will take time, but we're heads down and focused on it. And we're really excited about how successful the technology is in serving the customers that have come on board, right? For things like databases and ecommerce and content management and media and life sciences and an incredibly wide range of applications, frankly more than I had expected. We have compelling business advantage that we offer customers. Nehal Chokshi : Great. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, Nehal. Next questions. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Nick Todorov with Longbow Research. Nick Todorov : Thank you. Apologize for the background noise. Service margins continue to tick up despite I think you guys are still investing a lot of the CDS business, which is a headwind, which should abate at some point. Ron, can you comment about the runway, or how do you see the opportunity to continue to grow services margins over time? Ron Pasek : It's something that we are focused on in the sense that we're trying to get more efficient. Having said that, I don't want to be too much more higher than where we are today. It's not something I contemplated in our long-term guide at our Analyst Day, it's much about what we saw in this quarter. So, I think there is good work being done, there is some more work we can do, but [Technical Difficulty] upside to that number. Nick Todorov : Okay. And if I can just follow-up, at some point you in order to hit the fiscal year '21 guide for CDS, there needs to be a step function increase I guess on a quarter-over-quarter basis. I guess what are the -- what needs to -- what work needs to be done. Do you guys need Google also to go general availability to kind of start seeing really that inflection. So, investors can get more confident around that target exiting fiscal year '21? Thanks. George Kurian : We started, we got to general availability later than we expected, given the complexity of integrating a really high-performance service so deeply into these hyperscale cloud. We are at GA with Microsoft. We have clear line of sight into GA with Google. And we think that there is a broad -- the total addressable markets there. As I said earlier, the number of use cases that are being deployed on our platform is broader than we originally anticipated. And so, we've got work to do to execute to train the sales force, to train the Microsoft channel, get our message out to market and bringing the customers to be able to deploy them on our platform. We saw a good start to that with the attendance at Microsoft Ignite and at NetApp Insight where the number of people coming to talk to us and starts to do proof of concepts with us, were really good. So, we've got heads down. We got to deliver on getting these customers successful, but we feel like we got a really, really good platform and the early results have been really good. Nick Todorov : Thanks. Good luck, guys. Kris Newton : Thanks, Nick. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Cross Research. Steven Fox : Hi, good afternoon. Just one question from me. George, obviously you're not making any grand ambitions about the macro, so when you mentioned the return of growth, I assume for next fiscal year. Is it mainly driven by the sales force execution or how would you sort of rank and characterize what's most important in terms of getting back to top-line growth? Thank you. George Kurian : I think it's really making sure that we can capture the full range of opportunities that are available in front of us. As I said, we have leadership positions in a broad range of categories of primary storage. We are the only vendor with the cloud strategy and really compelling technology available in the big public clouds, all of the big public clouds. And we need to be able to go and access the customers that are making those decisions which is where the sales headcount focus is really a critical part of the go forward plan. The differentiation of our technology is evident in product gross margins, right? And the leverage of our business model is evident in the results we just showed and the guidance we gave. And I think for us it's the macro is going to be the macro, we're going to go take share and to go after the addressable market. We are doing that prudently within the guidance of that we gave you and by prioritizing our resources against the biggest opportunities. Steven Fox : I appreciate that color. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, Steven. Next question. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Matt Sheerin : Yes. Thank you. Could you talk about the contribution you saw in the quarter from your big distribution channel partners, several distributors and resellers have called out relative strength in the storage following your very weak June quarter. I mean is that a reflection of the middle markets being a little bit more stable or bouncing or any changes in your channel partner programs? Thank you. George Kurian : The contribution of indirect channels to our business was relatively unchanged in terms of the overall mix of our business. It's approximately 80% each quarter, and we feel that that's well reflective of our overall book of business, nothing unusual there. You are correct that the mid-market is relatively less concerned about the impact of the global economic slowdown and some of the uncertainty there. And we have more opportunities to capture share because our share in the mid-market is a bit smaller than it is in the enterprise. Our channel partners were focused on enabling focused set of channel partners, so that they get the full impact of NetApp's enablement resources and so we've got a narrow group that we work with, and we're pleased with the progress so far. Kris Newton : All right. Thanks, Matt. I'll pass it back to George for some final comments. George Kurian : Before we close, I want to underscore a few key points. NetApp is helping customers deliver enormous business value in both traditional IT-led and increasingly in cloud-led use cases. Only NetApp has the strategy, the broad innovation portfolio and customer experience to help customers succeed in hybrid multicloud IT. We believe we can return to growth over time by selling the value of our differentiated portfolio and investing in additional sales capacity to reach new buyers. As I saw at Insight and Ignite, we are making real progress here. We continue to be disciplined in our spending and have a strong financial model with growing gross margins and operating margins that enable us to return cash to shareholders and invest in the long-term health of our business. Thank you. And I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating and you may now disconnect.

My name is Cherie, and I will be your conference call coordinator for today. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. I would now like to turn the call over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Please proceed Ms. Newton. Kris Newton : Thank you for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Ron Pasek. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2020, our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability and shareholder returns and our ability to improve execution gain share, reaccelerate growth and expand our sales capacity without increasing total operating expenses, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially for a variety of reasons, including macroeconomic and market conditions, the IT capital spending environment, and our ability to expand our total available market acquire new accounts expand in existing accounts, capitalize on our Data Fabric strategy, improve our consistency of sales execution and continue our capital allocation strategy. Please also refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC and available on our website, specifically our most recent Form 10-K for fiscal year 2019, including the management's discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations and risk factors sections and our current reports on Form 8-K. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are posted on our website. I'll now turn the call over to George. George Kurian : Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Before I get into our results for the third quarter I want to take a moment to talk about Ron. Today we announced that, Ron has decided to retire by the end of the fiscal year. I want to recognize his many contributions since joining NetApp in 2016. Under Ron's leadership, we have increased product margins by 10 points, nearly doubled our earnings power and raised our dividend by over 100%. He has played a pivotal role in helping NetApp navigate a transformational period as we focus on becoming the leader in hybrid cloud data services. I think you'll agree that he's always been a true and honest broker. Knowing that this is his last earnings call before he retires is certainly bittersweet for me. We continuously think about what's next for the company and that includes thoughtful proactive succession planning. To that end Ron and I have been talking about the prospect of this transition for some time. During the search process, we have been focused on finding the right person to take on the role of Chief Financial Officer, and I'm very pleased with the quality of candidates. I expect that we will have someone in the role before the end of the quarter. Ron will stay on to ensure a seamless transition and I'm grateful for that. Ron Pasek : Thank you, George. Let me start by expressing my deep appreciation for the opportunity to work alongside the talented team here at NetApp. These past four years have been incredibly rewarding. The team has proved to be collaborative, innovative and empowering and I'm proud of what we have achieved during my time here. I also want to thank the investor and analyst community as it's been a genuine pleasure working with all of you. This is an exciting time for our industry and for NetApp, and I look forward to helping our next CFO transition into the role. George Kurian : Thank you, Ron. Now, let's turn to an overview of the quarter. Despite the top line challenges, we continued our operational discipline, highlighted by strong gross margin, cash flow and operating leverage without the benefit from anticipated ELA revenue in the quarter. These results reflect the strength of our business model as we take deliberate steps to better capitalize on our opportunity and return the company to growth. However, macroeconomic headwinds and unpredictability in large enterprise purchasing behavior persist. Customers are on a journey to the cloud and they are looking to NetApp to help them as they grapple with the complexities of data management in hybrid multi-cloud IT environments. With our Data Fabric strategy, we help customers address these challenges giving us access to new buyers and workloads, as well as increasing the relevance of NetApp to companies both large and small. We not only have opportunity in the public cloud, but we also have increased our value for on-premises deployments. Our ability to deliver real business value to customers' hybrid multi-cloud environments, fuels my confidence that we can return to growth. While we see exceptional opportunity ahead, we are planning our business assuming no change in external factors for the foreseeable future. To improve our execution in this environment, we laid out a plan at the start of the fiscal year to replicate our proven areas of success by getting in front of more buyers with our full portfolio. We are on track to increase sales capacity by approximately 200 primary sales resources by the end of Q1 fiscal year 2021 without adding to the total operating expenses for the company. The majority of the sales headcount will be deployed in our Americas geography. They will be focused on acquiring new accounts and engaging new buyers like cloud architects in existing accounts. We are seeing early signs of success by expanding our reach and focus on new customer acquisition. Our dedicated acquired districts continue to deliver strong growth across all metrics sales, units and customers. The growth of these metrics accelerated in Q3, as did the growth of the pipeline pointing to continued progress in coming quarters. While the acquired districts performed well, we still need to broaden our share of wallet at our largest customers. We are making progress here. However, it is in our largest accounts which have the greatest exposure to the macro that the demand environment is the least predictable. In Q3, our all-flash array business inclusive of all-flash FAS, EF and SolidFire products and services increased from Q2 to an annualized net revenue run rate of $2.3 billion. We introduced new all-flash array and hybrid flash array platforms as well as a SAN-optimized all-flash array, which delivers a simplified and dedicated SAN experience. Our core storage offerings continue to gain industry accolades. Last quarter NetApp took the highest ranking in the leaders' quadrant of Gartner's Magic Quadrant for primary storage. In Q3, NetApp was named a leader in IDC's file-based storage MarketScape with the recommendation that customers in need of hybrid cloud solutions should consider NetApp, because of our expanded product portfolio investments and vision. Our building blocks for private cloud deployments SolidFire, NetApp HCI and StorageGRID enable customers to bring public cloud-like experience and economics into their data centers. Our private cloud business, inclusive of products and services grew 10% from last quarter, attaining an annualized net revenue run rate of almost $350 million. To meet the increasing demand for Object Storage, NetApp announced new StorageGRID software platforms and the ability to tier to Azure Blob Storage. IDC named NetApp a leader in its object-based storage MarketScape citing our vast experience in unstructured data. They recommend customers consider StorageGRID, when dealing with petabyte-scale data sets across various deployment locations because of its unique hybrid multi-cloud integrations. Based on the last month of Q3, our annualized recurring revenue for cloud data services increased to approximately $83 million, up 146% year-over-year. We are now generally available with both Cloud Volumes Service and Cloud Volumes ONTAP for all the leading hyperscale cloud providers : Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services. Additionally, we added cloud compliance as a feature to Cloud Volumes ONTAP, which help customers comply with today's privacy and other data regulations. We continue to see a healthy mix of customers new to NetApp in our cloud services as they enable us to acquire new customers and reach new buyers as well as expand the data sets managed at existing customers. Our deep integration for a broad and growing range of use cases with the leading public clouds and industry-leading technology for on-premises storage solutions gives us a sustainable competitive advantage. Let me share with you a few customer examples to illustrate how our data fabric strategy allows us to acquire new customers, expand our footprint at existing customers and increase our strategic value. A U.S.-based research hospital in one of our acquired districts chose to go with NetApp on-premises and in the cloud. Our ability to connect their data centers to each other and to multiple public cloud providers all with a consistent management interface placed us well ahead of the competition in addressing the customer's requirements. A global retailer and current NetApp customer has halted its on-premises IT spending in favor of a Cloud First Strategy. They plan to migrate their large SAP HANA environment to the cloud to gain flexibility and speed of scale using Cloud Volumes ONTAP and Azure NetApp Files, because of our ability to help the customer easily migrate to the cloud we will retain not only the data currently managed by NetApp in their data centers, but we will also move competitor's on-premises footprints onto NetApp in the cloud. And finally on our Q1 call, I told you that we were working with a Fortune 10 company to migrate its existing data centers to the cloud. That customer now has line of sight to move 100 petabytes of data, largely from our competitor systems to Azure NetApp Files. By partnering with them to achieve their cloud-first initiative, we have elevated NetApp from an infrastructure provider with a minority position in their data center to a key strategic partner. The power of our Data Fabric strategy increases our strategic relevance to customers which creates long-term value for NetApp and our shareholders. It enables us to reach new buyers through new pathways address new workloads and expand our presence with existing customers and it drives our innovation agenda which we advanced significantly in the quarter. We are delivering an enormous amount of value to a growing number of customers. Only NetApp has the strategy, the innovation portfolio and customer experience to help customers succeed in hybrid multi-cloud IT. Our strong business model resulting from the hard work we conducted to improve gross margin and our cost structure over the last several years enables us to navigate the dynamics of the macro economy and customer demand environment while making the strategic investments necessary to cement our leadership in hybrid cloud data services. With that I'll turn it over to Ron for more details on the quarter and our expectations. Ron? Ron Pasek : Thanks, George. As a reminder I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers, unless otherwise noted. As George highlighted, in Q3 we delivered solid margins and operating leverage in the face of revenue weakness. Despite the demand uncertainty, we generated strong free cash flow and remain confident in our product leadership and strategy to reaccelerate growth going forward. Before discussing our guidance, I'll provide further detail on our Q3 performance. In Q3 net revenues of $1.4 billion decreased 10% year-over-year. We had zero ELA revenue in the quarter, although we had expected approximately $50 million. Product revenue of $787 million, decreased approximately 19% year-over-year. Moving down to P&L. Software maintenance and hardware maintenance revenue of $556 million was up nearly 5% year-over-year with better execution in our renewals business starting to deliver results. Deferred revenue increased 6% year-over-year in Q3. Gross margin of 67.8% was above our guidance. Product gross margin was 55.4%, which is an increase of 2.8 points year-over-year. The year-over-year improvement was driven by continued sales force discipline an increase in all-flash product mix and cost reductions. Q3 was the 12th straight quarter we increased product margins year-over-year when adjusting for the benefit of ELAs. The Q2 to Q3 seasonal decrease in product margins was driven by customer and product mix. We've seen almost no degradation in product margins as a result of increased NAND pricing. The combination of software and hardware maintenance and other services gross margin of 83.6% increased nearly 200 basis points year-over-year driven by continued productivity improvements. Q3 operating expenses of $640 million, increased approximately 2% year-over-year, driven by annual merit increases. Operating margin was 22.2% and in line with our guidance. EPS of $1.16 was down 3% year-over-year but well within the guidance range. We closed Q3 with $3 billion in cash and short-term investments. Our cash conversion cycle was a positive one day, an increase of 12 days year-over-year. DSO of 53 days was up two days year-over-year. DIO was 22 days an increase of seven days year-over-year. And DPO was 75 days, down three days year-over-year. Cash flow from operations was $420 million. Free cash flow was $388 million representing 28% of revenue. We are maintaining our expectation for free cash flow to be in the range of 19% to 21% of revenues in fiscal 2020. During Q3, we repurchased 8.2 million shares at an average price of $61.20 for a total of $500 million. As of the end of Q3, we had $640 million remaining on our original $4 billion buyback authorization. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 229 million, down 26 million shares year-on-year, representing a 10% decrease. During the quarter we paid out $108 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $608 million to shareholders in the quarter. Our fiscal Q4 cash dividend will be $0.48 per share. Now on to guidance. As we've noted over the past several quarters, the demand environment continues to be challenged. As a result, we expect Q4 net revenues to range between $1.455 billion and $1.605 billion, which at the midpoint implies a 4% decline in revenues year-over-year including 0.5 point of currency headwind. Consistent with normal seasonal sequential decline in gross margin from Q3 to Q4 associated with product revenue being a larger portion of the overall revenue mix, we expect consolidated gross margin to range between 66% and 67%. We expect Q4 operating margin to range between 23% and 24%. We expect earnings per share for Q4 to range between $1.28 and $1.36 per share which at the midpoint implies an 8% increase year-over-year. The midpoint of our Q4 revenue guidance implies that total fiscal 2020 revenue will be down 10% with ELAs being approximately 1% of total revenues. Our Q4 guidance also implies fiscal 2020 gross margin of 67% to 68% and operating margin of approximately 21%. We expect fiscal 2020 EPS to be down approximately 7% year-over-year and within the range we guided last quarter. As George noted, we are seeing early signs of success from our strategic investments in sales coverage, which provides confidence in our ability to return the company to long-term growth. I want to again thank the NetApp team, our shareholders, customers and partners for making the last four years a rewarding experience. With that, I'll hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris? Kris Newton : Thanks, Ron. We will now open the call for Q&A. Please be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to just one question, so we can get to as many people as possible. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Karl Ackerman with Cowen. Karl Ackerman : Hey. Good afternoon. Thank you for letting me ask question. Ron, I guess, if -- I guess I'm not sure what we should assume for ELA revenue in the April quarter guide. But even if we were to back out ELA revenue in the guide it would seem that product gross margins will take a step down by a couple of hundred basis points. And so I guess am I missing something? And then secondarily is that -- would that be based on component cost headwinds from NAND? Or are there other manufacturing costs we should be thinking about? Thank you. Ron Pasek : Thanks, Karl. So as you know we don't guide product margins discretely. But what we do have is about 1% of ELAs for the year in Q4 as opposed to what we had before is 2%. There's a lot of other -- so first of all in -- with respect to component costs it is a very small amount we saw quarter-to-quarter from Q2 to Q3. That was -- a headwind to gross margin was 0.1% so -- but there's a whole lot of other mix, right? There's mix by product. If we have a higher flash mix it tends to help margin all things being equal. We have higher software mix that helps gross margin. So there's a lot of dynamics under there. I wouldn't read anything into it with respect to component costs. George Kurian : I think with regard to the Q4 guide, the gross margin picture is affected by the fact that the mix between products and services leans more to products than it did in Q3. That's the typical seasonality that we see in the Q4 seasonal pattern. So we are not seeing anything specific other than just the mix of product and services being a little different than it was this quarter. Karl Ackerman : Thank you. Best of luck, Ron and thanks. It's great to meet you and hopeful as well. Thank you. Ron Pasek : Thanks Karl. Kris Newton : Thank you, Karl. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Rod Hall : Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. Congratulations on the retirement Ron. Good working with you. And I wanted to just go back to these ELAs. I'm calculating if you're saying 1% of full year revenue I mean the exact calculation on that's about $55 million. I'm assuming this is a rough estimate it could be $50 million. But just three months ago you guys thought it'd be $100 million. And I'm just wondering what -- why you continue to think you've got visibility here and we have so much uncertainty on these ELAs and why include them in the guidance given all that. Ron Pasek : We can see some of them. They're still difficult to predict but they always were back-end loaded so some of the ones that we expect in Q4 probably going to slip out of the year. That's really it. But it's a very different year than last year. Last year they're front-end loaded. This year they're back-end loaded. As we told you they're difficult to predict in a quarter. And then if they come at the end of the year they're difficult to predict than they're going to come in the year. So it's just that simple. Having said all that, we still are really happy with the gross margin performance of the underlying product revenue. It's very strong. It won't be a headwind because of [indiscernible] ELAs year-to-year. George Kurian : I think as Ron said Rod these ELAs are meant to make it easier for the customer to buy and they benefit from the structure of the ELAs to being able to buy more product more easily. We've always said they are choppy and hard to predict. We have deep engagements with the customers that we are structuring ELAs with. And we had we thought one in the quarter that has moved out and that's why we've also taken down the range from 2% to 1%. So we're trying to do the best we can to give you a view of what's available and we're balancing that with the probability that some of them may not happen in the year. Rod Hall : Could you guys elaborate -- I mean you say it's one George. Is this just a few ELA deals that would have amounted to $100 million? So the $55 million maybe that's a couple of deals? Or can you give us any idea on that? George Kurian : Listen, I think these are by nature large transactions with a very few customers, right? It's -- 1% or 2% of our total revenue is not a large number and the number of those transactions are very, very few. So each of them are lumpy, hard to predict and sizable and I'll just leave it there Rod. Rod Hall : Okay. All right, thank you guys. Kris Newton : Thanks Rod. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Wamsi Mohan : Hi, thank you. I know you just guided Q4, but can you give us any sense at all on how we should look at fiscal 2021? You have NAND pricing moving up again, your compares are quite easy, cloud data services seems to be doing better. Can you give us some guidepost on fiscal 2021? Talk about maybe at least some of the puts and takes on revenue and also on gross margins, if you could please? George Kurian : Listen, let me just kind of - we're not going to guide the next fiscal year. We'll give you that guidance when we actually guide it. I could tell you that first of all the investments we are making in additional sales coverage, we are on-track against our target of 200 incremental sales headcount covering new accounts and driving customer acquisition by the end of Q1 fiscal year 2020. It takes those sales reps roughly four quarters to get productive, so the majority of the productivity will show up next year which should drive the year-on-year model to be favorable relative to what we had this year. And we are seeing the early payoff of some of the investments, we made in acquisition accounts and acquisition districts as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, showing up positively and accelerating through the course of the year. With regard to product gross margins as Ron mentioned, we have been maintaining strong margins across the board both on product and services reflecting the differentiation of our offerings, the work that we've done in terms of driving productivity in the business and the discipline of our sales force to capture the full value of our offerings. And we think that regardless of the ELA picture, we have a sound business model on the gross margin side. We have been disciplined in our operating expenses. As we said, we have outlaid the sales headcount without adding to the operating expense structure of the company. And we'll tell you more about our plans for how we continue to be disciplined on operating expenses next year. But overall the business model of the company is a strong one. I have every confidence that on the top line the investments we're making this year together with our really strong product portfolio should drive positive territory next year. Wamsi Mohan : George, appreciate that color. If I could really quick? On the ELAs what is the hesitancy that you're seeing at the customer base particularly because they don't necessarily have to shell out the cash upfront? So why is this not an indication that they're kicking the tires around other products? Or how should people read this hesitancy around signing ELAs? George Kurian : I think first of all with regard to our competitive position, the data that we mentioned about our ability to win new accounts and gain share in new districts proves that we have strong competitive positions. With regard to these accounts that we are doing ELA discussions with we are deeply, deeply involved in those accounts. We've got many years of experience dealing with them and we don't see that they're headed to an alternate architecture or alternate buying motion. I think these transactions are complex. They require coordination across many departments and the customer. We've always been transparent about the fact that they're lumpy, right? And there's very few of them. So my own view is ELAs are 1% to 2% of our business. The majority of the business is extremely healthy. These customers that we are in discussions with we have other ways to pursue meeting their needs beyond the ELAs and we are using that in other parts of some of these accounts. So we'll tell you more as the ELAs come through and we get more visibility into some of these discussions going forward. Wamsi Mohan : Okay. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks Wamsi. Next question. Operator : Next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Katy Huberty : Thank you, good afternoon. Just looking at the product revenue trajectory, the decline accelerated in the January quarter, despite an easier compare, can you just talk about where you saw some of the incremental weakness in January? George Kurian : Well I think the ELA was a contributing factor to the decline. I think, if ELA had been -- had come in I think the picture would have been quite different Katy. I think with regard to the weakness in product revenue which continues to be in the largest enterprises, as we have said those are the ones that are most affected by uncertain macroeconomic buying conditions. And we are trying to balance our exposure to those accounts by acquiring new accounts. We've seen good results from that. And hopefully those two lines should cross over at some point in the near future. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Ron, congratulations on your retirement. Ron Pasek : Thanks Katy. Kris Newton : Thanks Katy. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Tim Long with Barclays. Tim Long : Thank you. Congratulations as well, Ron. Yeah. George and Ron, I just wanted to ask about the Cloud Data Services business. It is kind of moving higher. But it seems like the last few quarters, you've been adding more partners that you GA add and more products and solutions. And I think, we're at pretty much four quarters in a row where the -- kind of the sequential growth was about $10 million give or take $1 million, in that line. So, could you just talk a little bit about what you think, it will take for that line to inflect, a little bit more? Or is it more experience with the partners or other products? Or what do you think it will be that will make that line start to move a little more aggressively higher? Thank you. George Kurian : Thanks for the question. There are two things that we believe will allow us to move that lineup. I think the first is we continue to do enablement and training. And we are acquiring more new customers, every single day. These workloads or applications that we serve in the public cloud, they are important applications, right? They're mission-critical applications, high-performance applications. And so it takes a while for the customer to get comfortable with the usage of our technology, before they adopt and expand. We are seeing some of the early customers who did proof of concepts with us, started to move some workloads. And now is starting to broaden their book of business. So that will take a little bit of ramp time. The second is, due to overwhelming demand. And the fact that operationally, we are in the early phases of a multi-region global rollout. We have a process that we've agreed on with the hyperscale cloud provider, which is we call -- which they call white-listing, where the customer requires a registration for us to manually approve them being onboarded. We are in a window where we're working hard to remove white-listing. And that will allow us to scale, demand more -- in a much more automated fashion. So those are the two key things that we need to get through to be able to scale it even faster. Tim Long : Okay. And I assume we're still on track with the long-term targets here? George Kurian : We have clearly signs of the favorable demand patterns. And as we see that the market opportunity is clearly there to get. And that's clearly our goal and intent. As we said, we are about a year behind where we wanted to be because of the time. It's taken us to get these services to production readiness, and so we're going to continue to push to see, how we can get to that target. And we'll keep you updated on progress. Tim Long : Okay. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, Tim, next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : Yeah. Thanks for taking my question and also congratulations Ron. It's been great working with you. I apologize to go back to this discussion. But maybe just trying to understand the math a little bit more given I think the questions I'll get is, if I look at the lumpiness in the ELA business. And I appreciate that that lumpiness will continue. I think it's important to kind of understand, what you're saying about the gross margin. So, if I assume the ELA gross margin is close to 100%, it seems like your implicit guide on gross margin is back into the mid-65% range. So I guess, what I'm asking is, what am I missing? And I can appreciate the mix of the business is a variable, in the April quarter. But I'm just trying to think about if ELAs aren't there, how do we think about that gross margin structure going through the course of the next couple of quarters? Ron Pasek : So, we guided gross margin for the quarter between 66% and 67%. Last quarter for Q3, it was closer to 68%. You have a higher mix of product revenue, in Q4. That's the biggest degradation to margins. There's a -- without going into a specific number the product margin guide employed in that, is actually higher than Q3 because of the ELA. So I think, it just -- you can't see all this. But I'm telling you it actually all holds together. So... Aaron Rakers : Okay. And the ELA -- yeah, I know that ELA attributes there's affects that after the upfront software contributions. And actually you have some hardware-only revenue that kicks in, that has lower margins. That's not a variable at this point? Ron Pasek : That's right. That's kind of the variable. You've got -- as I said earlier, you have a mix now. We didn't historically have a mix difference in margin between all-flash. And hybrid and now we do. There's a big difference between, what you sell at all-flash in the margin versus hybrid. Plus, the mix of software is a wild card. So last quarter in Q3 we saw software being less of the total than we did in Q2. And that was a little bit of the degradation. So there's a lot of dynamics, going on under there. Aaron Rakers : Okay. Thank you very much. Ron Pasek : Sure. Kris Newton : All right, thanks, Aaron. Next question. Operator : Our next question is from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Mehdi Hosseini : Thanks for taking my questions. Ron, it was very nice working you. And good luck with your next endeavor. George, when I look at your guide for the April quarter. And I'd just make some assumption for the all-flash array. It seems like you're going to exit FY 2020 with a high single-digit decline, in all-flash array revenues. So as you reposition the sales force and you reload, how should we think about the embedded growth assumption for this particular area of flash array? Are we going to -- are we set out for double-digit growth? And if so, what gives you the confidence other than just hiring 200 more salespeople? And I have a follow-up. George Kurian : I think this year the all-flash array business has been affected in two dimensions. One was the fact that our largest customers who were most impacted by the macro were heavily all-flash customers. So from a product mix perspective, the fact that our biggest accounts underperformed or bought less impacted our all-flash business more substantially than it impacted pretty much every other product in the company. The second is that the ELAs were also heavily all-flash-oriented. So both of those have been contributing factors to the year-on-year declines in the all-flash category. We expect the work that we're doing with the deployment of additional sales force, resources as well as focusing our compensation plans and our sales objectives on returning to growth in the all-flash category to be able to drive our business at and above market growth rates. And we'll tell you more about that as we issue the FY 2021 guide. But we are taking actions to focus our sales force on the best-in-class product in the all-flash category which is ours right? And we have every confidence that we should be able to meet or beat the market next year. Mehdi Hosseini : Sure. And a quick follow-up. I understand ELAs have a material impact on product margin. But excluding ELA, NAND prices are going to go up and they're going to go up much higher than where they are today. So how are you able to manage product gross margin independent of ELA? Because I perceive ELAs as volatile and there's no way I could model that. So I just want to think about the increase in bill of material and how you're going to be able to manage that? Ron Pasek : So Mehdi, two things : number one is as you saw this quarter I think quarter-to-quarter NAND prices went up about 4% and have a very minimal effect on our gross margin, because contrary to popular belief not a big huge portion of the COGS in our system is actually NAND, right? A lot of it's software, a lot of it's other parts. So I think what you should see this year is -- you're right, this year we should project to see NAND go up, but it won't have a huge material effect on gross margin because there's a lot of other components. Mehdi Hosseini : And is that because you're able to -- that there's another replacement cycle coming? Is there a premium? Because on the margin NAND is going higher. I understand NAND is a small portion, but it's still going higher. George Kurian : Listen I think first of all for the drives in our platforms we typically pass the cost on to our customers, right? I think NAND is not an embedded component of our system, it is a consumable that we pass on to customers and so we don't try to mask the commodities in terms of the drives in our system. And so there will be -- at some point, as the market adjusts upward, if that is the trajectory, we're going to be discrete about making sure that we pass on some of that to our customers, right? And so we've had that history. I think the industry as a whole has had that history. And we'll disclose it when we do it, right? I think with regard to product gross margins they've been strong this year and even without ELAs because of the fact that our sales force has been enabled and we know how to sell the value of our offerings. A substantial portion of that value is actually software that both makes our systems the most efficient in the industry, but also allows our customers to uniquely take advantage of hybrid cloud capability that nobody else in the industry has. And so we are differentiated in software. That's proven out in the ability to hold gross margins in a tough economic environment. Mehdi Hosseini : Clear. Thank you. Kris Newton : Great. Thanks, Mehdi. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. Matt Cabral : Yeah. Thank you. George, can you just talk a little bit about the wider demand environment that you're seeing and if it's changed at all versus the prior few quarters? And then I guess given it's been about a year since you've been calling out macro as a headwind what gives you confidence that these larger deals are just actually being pushed as opposed to either competitive losses or some sort of a secular shift in customers thinking about their on-prem footprint more broadly? George Kurian : So we saw the first signs of the macro being a little bit more choppy was about a year ago in January. We saw a substantial step-down from that level of uncertainty into a much more sort of uncertain environment in Q1. I think from Q1 -- of our fiscal Q1. I think from then on it's stayed relatively in the same territory. I wouldn't say it has gotten worse. It is reflective of three or four key things. I think the first is buying cycles are longer and the amount of spend per transaction is smaller. I think we have consistently seen a higher rate and number of transactions across a broader range of accounts, especially as we've added sales capacity through the year. And so, that's indications that we can win in net new accounts, but that the average transaction size is more muted. You also see the fact as we've said where people are buying for now versus buying capacity for the long-term. Even though you hand people incentives to buy a larger transaction, they're more sort of comfortable buying for the short-term. Those are some of the key things. With regard to what gives us confidence that we can return to growth, listen I think first of all, we have relatively easy compares in the first half of next year. We've put in capacity ahead of that window to get our sales teams productive. We've got work to do to enable all the 200 that we put in place. But the results from the new deployments of resources in terms of customer wins, units, sales volume, use cases, have all been really encouraging. With regard to these large customers that we are engaged with, we have deep relationships with them. We know when they're making an architectural choice to go to the cloud, because we are an intimate part of those cloud discussions with many. And frankly, as we said in our prepared remarks, some of them going to cloud might be a near-term hindrance to revenue growth, but they give us a much broader revenue opportunity in the medium-term, right? We mentioned the Fortune 10 company, which as they've moved to cloud has given us a maybe 3 to 4 times larger opportunity than we had on premises. And so, we're excited about that opportunity in those accounts that are choosing to move to cloud. Kris Newton : All right. Thanks, Matt. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Ananda Baruah : Good afternoon, guys. Appreciate you taking the question. Ron, from me as well congratulations, it's been great working with you. Really enjoyed it. Ron Pasek : Thank you. Appreciate that. Ananda Baruah : Yeah. You're welcome. George, I know you just said that you don't -- at least broadly speaking you don't think that you're seeing the spending environment get more challenging. Could you -- like, if I back out the ELAs from the strategic revenue, you put up slightly sort of more favorable declines in the Jan quarter, but it was off a meaningfully easier compare. And so, I don't know. The numbers seem to suggest that like maybe there is some incremental interference in the spending environment. So, I just want to run that by you and just make sure that I understood your comment accurately. And then, I'm just going to add one more in there too. Do you feel like with the new sales force ramp-on that you're where you -- from a productivity perspective, that you're where you want it to be at this point? If you could update us there. Just I think we're all just looking for kind of context around the -- not just the product revenue, but the strategic product revenue spending dynamic sense. George Kurian : Listen, I think that we're seeing the environment is choppy, right? We are seeing that customer spending, enterprise IT spending for on-premises data centers is choppy and that has been true for a few quarters now. Do I have enough data to say, it's a shade better or a shade worse? I don't have that data right? I'm just saying it is pretty choppy and uncertain. I think with regard to the sales force productivity, we've always said it's between three and four quarters, roughly four quarters for a new account manager to be fully trained and equipped and ready. We said that we would be adding increments of 50 headcount starting in Q2 of fiscal year 2020 and finishing at the end of Q1 fiscal year 2021. So we would have four chunks of that. We are on track with the hiring, and we're working hard on enablement, right? And so, I think if you do the math the majority of the productivity impact of that headcount is actually next fiscal year. And listen, we'd love to move the productivity impact earlier and we're doing everything we can, but I think that's where you should reasonably model it. Ananda Baruah : Okay. Okay, great. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, Ananda. Next question? Operator : Our next question is from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Matt Sheerin : Yes. Thank you. I wanted to ask about any potential impact you're seeing from the coronavirus in your supply chain, given that most of your key suppliers are in Asia, in China. So, any constraints there? Or given that you're still early in the quarter, and you tend to be more back-end loaded by the time you get through the quarter that shouldn't be an issue? George Kurian : Listen, our Q4 revenue guide does not include any disruption to our supply chain from the coronavirus. So far, two elements of our business and their potential impact on coronavirus, right? On the demand side, we don't have a large business in China. We, as you know, prosecute that business through a joint venture with Lenovo, who are the distributors of our technology in China. Our customers are -- do large amounts of business in China, so I would model on the demand side that our impact to us is a second-order derivative, right? With regard to the supply side, with regard to our supply chain, yes, we like others have supply base that is built \u2013 that has a meaningful footprint in China. And we are working pretty hard on contingency planning to minimize disruptions. So far, we have not seen any, but I think there's probably likely some and we're working hard to minimize that. Matt Sheerin : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Cross Research. Steven Fox : Thanks. Good afternoon. Congrats Ron on your retirement. I'm thinking you might have a future as a NAND analyst going forward. You may not like the job. In terms of questions, I was just curious this may be in the rounding of the numbers but it looks like sales through channel the channel were a little weaker year-over-year. I was wondering, if you could talk a little bit about that? And also a similar question on the public sector markets was there any changes relative to your expectations there? It seemed like it came off a regular sort of end to the \u2013 their October fiscal year? Thank you. Ron Pasek : So with respect to the mix of channel, I mean, that vacillates \u2013 it's usually 80/20 as vacillates around that mean. There's nothing underlying there that was \u2013 is permanent or unusual. Steven Fox : Okay. Thanks. George Kurian : With regard to the public sector business mostly performed according to plan. I think we saw a pretty normal pattern of business in our public sector. Steven Fox : And just as a follow-up to that any initiatives to sort of maybe reaccelerate your business there? I know, one of your smaller competitors has been focusing on that area. Do you see that as a threat? Or is this more just tied to general budgets? George Kurian : Listen, I think we have a variety of ways to broaden our relevance in the public sector. We are working with some of our cloud provider partners to be part of their initiatives and to serve our men and women in uniform in new and interesting ways. So we'll tell you more about that as we bring those to market. Steven Fox : Okay. Thank you very much. Kris Newton : Thank you, Steve. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Jim Suva : Thanks very much. George, if I remember right, it was approximately six months ago you'd mentioned about increasing sales force by 200 and you mentioned it again. I was just wondering, is the tempo or the cadence of that going faster than expected in line with expected slower than expected? Because what I'm trying to do is figure out the softer guidance. Is it being impacted at all by that sales force transition? Or is it more macro and just longer decision-making time lines? Thank you so much. George Kurian : With regard to the sales force, we said that we would add 200 incremental sales resources to allow us to acquire new customers. We laid that out in four quarters sort of saying that we would start in Q2 of fiscal \u2013 of this fiscal year and finish at the end of Q1 of fiscal year 2021, and we are on track. As I said in my prepared remarks, we are bringing good candidates on board and we are generally on track. We also said that it would take a typical new sales rep about four quarters to get productive. So if you do the math, the majority of the benefits of that investment really are next year, right? With regard to Q4, the change or the softness is really for us being a little bit more conservative on ELAs going from previously what we thought would be 2% down to 1% maybe a shade below 1% in that range, right? And so I think that's the majority of the change between what you saw previously and what you see now. Jim Suva : Thank you so much for the clarifications and detail that's greatly appreciated. And Ron we'll greatly miss you. Ron Pasek : Thank you. Appreciate it, Jim. Kris Newton : Thanks, Jim. Next question. Operator : Our next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Simon Leopold : Thank you for taking the question and Ron congratulations on the retirement. I wanted to see if we can maybe talk about your overall philosophy regarding return of capital. You've been buying back a lot of stock another $500 million this quarter paying a good dividend over $100 million. And so you've been exceeding your free cash flow and you're almost out of the authorized $600 million. So I assume you're going to update us on that at some point. But I guess what I'm trying to get to is the long-term philosophy. And does the transition of CFO mean that you'll want to wait for the new CFO to set a philosophy? Or how are you thinking? Thank you. Ron Pasek : Well, yeah, I think it's going to coincide with the change in the fiscal year, when we give the guide. Obviously, we'll give some clarity around what would happen to the capital allocation policy. But the dividend is permanent that's not going to change. If anything it's going to go up as we proceed from here on out. And to your point, we're almost done with the $4 billion share repurchase. So you could see that getting to an end fairly soon and the company will probably re-clarify what the next tranche will be going forward. And I'll let my successor determine that with George. George Kurian : I'll just say that Ron and I have had a common philosophy and a shared one around the sources and uses of cash. I don't think you should see a radical departure from our belief that cash is an important asset for both investing in the long-term health of the business and in terms of providing returns to shareholders. So, I don't think that you should see us make a radical departure from that philosophy going forward. Simon Leopold : Great. Thank you. That's helpful. Kris Newton : All right. Thanks Simon. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Lou Miscioscia with Daiwa Capital Markets. Lou Miscioscia : Okay. Thank you. Ron, best of luck it's good having you. So, I wanted to just and I went back further 10 years, but really want to focus on the last seven years. If I take out the ELAs for the quarter just to look at product revenue on a quarter-to-quarter basis, the average growth is actually about $39 million if I'm getting this all right. And with that four out of the last seven actually were material misses and the other three were just basically hitting let's say $73 million to $77 million quarter-to-quarter. So, I guess, I'd be just a little worried on even this lower product revenue taking out ELAs. So, again, given the choppy environment and all the uncertainty, why would we -- why would you be able to hit that midpoint? George Kurian : You're talking about Q4? Lou Miscioscia : Q4 over Q3, yes, sequential growth of product revenue to get to the -- if I'm modeling very easily software maintenance and services, I don't think they're hard to model. And thus when I look at product revenue, I take out the $50 million, again, it seems like your average was $39 million quarter-to-quarter. George Kurian : So, Q4 has always been the strongest quarter in terms of a year-end finish for our sales force. I think we have done a good amount of work in terms of looking at our pipeline. And we're not saying that the guide isn't requires really good execution and it doesn't require disruption due to coronavirus or anything else. But I think that we're counting on the fact that we are at the end of a fiscal year and Q4 is the quarter that those sales reps that are in the money are going to bring in transactions, right? I think that's the short summary. I think like all plans we go into the quarter looking at our pipeline looking at close rates looking at how many transactions that are high probability medium probability low probability are required to get in these numbers and we've done that work. It is a choppy environment. And so we've tried to be cautious around the probabilities, but we've done -- we're doing as much due diligence as we can with regard to the quality of the bookings forecast that we give you. Lou Miscioscia : Okay. Thank you. Kris Newton : All right. Thanks Lou. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi with Lake Street Capital Markets. Eric Martinuzzi : Yes, you've given us some good clarity on the sales hiring effort. I was just curious where did our headcount finish up for January 31st? And where do you expect it ending the fiscal year? Ron Pasek : So, it was roughly flat. It hasn't changed all that much. We -- you know we haven't been in a hiring mode except on the salesforce side. We're holding OpEx essentially flat this fiscal year. Some of that is variable comp, but it obviously implies that we're not adding a lot of people just in certain areas and rather surgically. Eric Martinuzzi : Okay. You guys normally have a college hiring cycle that would probably bring on people in Q1. Are you continuing to pursue that or are you -- has that been kind of suspended? Ron Pasek : No, that's ongoing. Eric Martinuzzi : Okay. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks Eric. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Nik Todorov with Longbow Research. Nik Todorov : Hi guys. Good afternoon. George we're continuing -- we're hearing that HCI Systems are displacing more and more traditional servers and storage systems. So, I get that that suggests that the market could be moving to that enterprise scale applications that your product addresses. But can you provide us with your outlook for 2020 in terms of -- do you expect to see an inflection in your HCI revenue in the next year? George Kurian : Listen HCI addresses some of the use cases in the customers' data center, particularly ones that are single application use. I think that we have a good offering. It's differentiated for mixed workloads and has several elements for customers who require good data management capabilities even in a single application use. And we're focusing our efforts in HCI in that part of the market. We don't see HCI displacing sort of the core of solid-state storage right? I think fiber channel storage as well as high-performance scale-out NFS storage has still got actually many, many applications in the data center. And our original view that HCI might displace those isn't being proven true. And I think you'll see us push aggressively with our flash and hybrid flash products to address those use cases. Nik Todorov : Got it. If I can follow up just quickly are you willing to share what percent of customers are still at a proof-of-concept stage with CDS? George Kurian : No, it's too early to comment on that. I think I would just tell you the majority of our customers today on CDS are in early production, right? So, they're in -- you could say they're in proof-of-concept of their first application deployment on our platform. And they might be in production on that application, but that's the first of many. They want to move to that platform. So broadly speaking, until we sort of remove ungated demand, which is removing what we call white-listing, every customer is in sort of a proof-of-concept mode. And once we remove that, you should be able to see much more automated onboarding of customers to that platform. Nick Todorov : Got it. Thanks guys. Good luck Ron. Kris Newton : Thank you, Nick. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer. George Iwanyc : Thank you for taking my question. And best of luck Ron. George, could you maybe give us a bit more color on trends in North America? Are there any areas where you're seeing market share gains from a workload perspective? Are you starting to see any benefit from the streamlined purchasing model? George Kurian : I think with regard to the use of consumption and consumption-based offerings we see that our cloud data services plus managed services from partners are really good opportunities for customers to get going with us in a consumption offering. I think we made our subscription type model available. We're seeing early interest that's very healthy, and we are working with a small group of customers on proof-of-concepts getting them on board and going from there. With regard to the streamlined pricing and packaging of our platforms, I think that's a big part of why product gross margins continue to be healthy, right? I think that customers are able to understand the value that we offer in a much more streamlined way than we historically used to. And so it's another support element for product gross margins helping our sales force establish value with customers. With regard to some of the shifts we see going on in the market, as I mentioned, we are participating with the hyperscaler cloud providers in new market opportunities and especially in the public sector market. We'll tell you more about it as those become real, but they expand our total addressable market opportunity in a way that we didn't before. Kris Newton : All right. Thanks, George. Next question. Operator : Thank you. And our final question will come from Nehal Chokshi with Maxim. Nehal Chokshi : Yeah. Thank you. The year-over-year trajectory on the hardware maintenance went from declining mid single-digits to flat. Is there a narrative behind that? Ron Pasek : Yeah. So actually if you remember even in Q1 and Q2 adjusting for currency, we were flat. This quarter it's up about 5%. What I tried to put in my prepared remarks and we've actually started to see the benefits of some of the work, we've been doing on renewals, so it's finally starting to pay off. Better renewal rates, better structures, better pricing, better discounting, so you'll have to wait until next year, but that's actually a bright spot that trend line is actually in really good shape. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. Thank you. Kris Newton : All right. Thanks Nehal. I'm going to pass it back to George for some final comments. George Kurian : Our Data Fabric strategy is creating value for our customers NetApp and our investors. Only NetApp has the strategy the innovation portfolio and customer experience to help customers succeed in hybrid multi-cloud IT. All these integration with the leading public clouds and industry-leading technology for on-premises storage solutions gives us a sustainable competitive advantage. We'll continue our strong focus on operational discipline, which enables us to make the strategic investments in sales coverage, customer experience and hybrid multi-cloud solutions needed to capitalize on the opportunity ahead. We are seeing early signs of success by getting in front of more customers, which gives me confidence that our investments will pay off in future growth. Thank you all and look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

My name is Liz, and I will be your conference call coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. I will now turn the call over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Corporate Communications and Investor Relations. Please proceed, Ms. Newton. Kris Newton : Thank you for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Mike Berry. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com. During today\u2019s call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the first quarter fiscal year 2021; our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability and shareholder return; and our ability to improve execution gain share, grow our cloud business and evolve our go-to-market strategy and organization, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially for a variety of reasons, including macroeconomic and market conditions, including the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the IT capital spending environment, and our ability to expand our total available market, acquire new accounts, expand in existing accounts, capitalize on our Data Fabric strategy, generate cash flow and execute our capital allocation strategy. Please also refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC and available on our website, specifically our most recent Form 10-K for fiscal year 2019, including the management\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and risk factor sections on our current reports on Form 8-K. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of the GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are posted on our website. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to George. George Kurian : Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before we get into the results of the quarter, I want to take a moment to acknowledge the unprecedented situation we are all experiencing. First and foremost, I want to express my sympathy for those who have been impacted by COVID-19 and my gratitude to those frontline workers, whose efforts help to keep us healthy and safe. I also want to acknowledge the tremendous amount of work that the NetApp team has done to coordinate efforts around the globe to keep our teams safe, while going above and beyond to be a strong partner to our customers. NetApp is an essential business providing critical infrastructure to vital public health and safety services, first responders, and public sector institutions in battleground cities. We\u2019ve increased our level of support for them, so that they can stay focused on their critical missions. In partnership with Core Scientific, we are giving COVID-19 researchers free access to AI as a service, powered by ONTAP AI and NVIDIA. We are also helping customers rapidly build virtual desktop infrastructure environments to support their growing remote workforce, and to help continue the education of our younger generation, our cloud solutions have been rapidly adopted in the last few weeks alone by many new state, local, and education customers to support VDI for telework and remote classrooms. I\u2019m so proud of the commitment and courage the NetApp team has demonstrated to each other to our partners and customers and to our community. My sincere thanks for all these fantastic efforts. They are representative of NetApp at our very best. Now, let\u2019s turn to the results of the quarter. We continue to make progress in improving our operational execution. By focusing on what we can control, we delivered strong gross margin, cash flow, and operating leverage in Q4 despite the challenging environment. The quarter started off well, and we were tracking to our targets until countries around the globe began going into lockdown. In April, the pace of business slowed significantly and our visibility was reduced. We saw delays in some large deals, while at the same time some companies accelerated orders to get ahead of shutdowns and others initiated new transactions to address the demands of remote working and digital business. Over the course of FY 2020, I\u2019ve outlined our plans to get in front of more buyers and more accounts with our industry-leading portfolio, where we know we can win. Our continued success in our dedicated acquired districts reinforced our decision to maintain the investments to expand our reach, despite the current market uncertainty. In Q4, we achieved our target of adding 200 primary sales headcount one quarter ahead of schedule. This additional sales capacity has enabled us to close coverage gaps and to dedicate resources focused on new customer acquisitions. As a reminder, we funded this headcount by making trade-offs in the business not by adding to the company\u2019s total operating expenses. Additionally, we continued to sharpen our focus on markets, where we have both a significant presence and clear competitive advantage, our storage, and Cloud Data Services businesses. Our File, Block, and Object Storage systems have strong industry and market endorsement from customers, partners, and analysts. We\u2019ve made our solutions easier to consume with Keystone, our reinvention of the customer experience. Keystone gives companies a real path to hybrid multi-cloud IT by delivering a consistent experience and subscription business model in both the biggest public clouds and in company\u2019s data center. We made tremendous progress in our cloud business in FY 2020. As I noted last quarter, we achieved general availability on all the leading cloud providers. NetApp Cloud Volumes is the number one shared file storage platform available in all the public clouds. Our intellectual property is embedded in every region and data center that Microsoft, Google, and Amazon Web Services bring online. We were again named Google Cloud Technology Partner of the Year for Infrastructure. Azure NetApp Files is Microsoft\u2019s shared storage platform for primary workloads, SAP, high-performance computing, database, Windows Virtual Desktop, and the Azure VMware Service. Azure continues to be a good source for new customer acquisition with more than 40% of Azure NetApp Files customers being new to NetApp. Our cloud partners are asking us to expand regional deployments, broaden workload certifications, and invest in go-to-market activities to support this rapidly growing business. Based on the last month of Q4, our annualized recurring revenue for cloud data services increased to $111 million. We saw growth accelerate through the quarter, as we continue to scale our cloud volume service and more companies turn to cloud to rapidly meet the requirements of remote working and digital business. We are adding new cloud customers and additional data services, such as cloud backup and cloud compliance, which are helping to drive new workloads and increased usage amongst existing customers, and we continue to bring more value to the cloud volumes platform. In the past two months, we acquired Talon, a provider of file caching software for remote and branch office workloads; and CloudJumper, a provider of a virtual desktop in the public cloud. We\u2019ve added these services to our cloud offerings to deliver a comprehensive, modern workplace foundation for all companies from born in the cloud startups in small businesses to the largest global enterprises. We\u2019re excited to include these talented teams in the NetApp family. As we enter into FY 2021, we will continue to manage the business efficiently while focusing on two clear priorities : returning to growth with share gains in our storage business powered by our industry-leading file block and object software and scaling our highly differentiated Cloud Data Services business. We will exploit competitive transitions and the accelerating shift to cloud to expand the usage of our products and services. We will continue to simplify the customer experience by bringing cloud-like flexibility to on-premises environments and deepening the connections between on-premises and cloud, and we will continue to strengthen our partnerships with the cloud providers and add value to our cloud data services, all of which will make it easier for customers to manage data in the hybrid multi-cloud environment and drive preference for our technology. We will also continue to evolve and align our sales and marketing to capture the opportunity ahead. We recently announced that Cesar Cernuda will join NetApp in July as President, leading sales, marketing, services, and support. Cesar has an impressive track record in leading transformations, building diverse high-performing teams, and driving a successful cloud business. He will continue to evolve our go-to-market strategy and operations to transform how we capitalize on the changing customer landscape to drive growth, particularly in cloud. Entering FY 2021, we created a separate globally integrated structure for our cloud data services sales teams, with the sole focus of scaling our Cloud Services business by maximizing our partnerships with the world\u2019s biggest public clouds and helping our customers and partners accelerate their public cloud journey. And as I noted earlier, we have closed coverage gaps with expanded enterprise sales and dedicated customer acquisition teams to further strengthen our position in the storage market. Data has always been central to the work we do. And the role of data is more important now than ever before. The resilience of our society and of our financial, governmental, educational and healthcare systems depends on the reliable safe and flexible access, storage and management of data. That is our vision. CEOs are prioritizing the ability to deliver services and products remotely to reach customers through digital means and to optimize remote operations and collaboration. It is critical to have an integrated IT architecture, especially for data. With our Data Fabric strategy, we help customers tackle these challenges by modernizing legacy infrastructure and simplifying the integration and orchestration of data services, so that they can rapidly respond to a changing environment and fuel innovation. While we cannot predict when the world will return to normal, the enduring importance of data is clear. We are confident that the demand for our products and services will be strong as we emerge from this crisis. The strength and resiliency of our business model enables us to continue to execute our strategy while navigating a range of demand environments. We will continue to make prudent decisions in the face of the current reality, focusing on the priorities that will enable us to return to growth. We will also maintain operational discipline and ensure that our strong balance sheet will support our ability to create long-term shareholder value through a wide range of scenarios. We are focusing our resources on the solutions that lead to the highest returns, storage and cloud data services. We are broadening our reach with a dedicated cloud sales focus, expanded enterprise sales coverage and dedicated customer acquisition resources. I\u2019m confident that these actions position NetApp to emerge from the current health crisis stronger than ever. We will host an Analyst Day on September the 16th, where we will share more information on our plans for the continued evolution of NetApp and a multi-year business outlook. We hope that you\u2019ll be able to join us. Finally, I\u2019m happy to introduce Mike Berry, our new Chief Financial Officer. I\u2019m excited to have Mike and his deep knowledge of the technology and software industry on the team. He will be a key partner, as we strengthen our leadership position in hybrid cloud data services and deliver long-term shareholder value. Mike\u2019s first day coincided with our local shelter in place order. Despite the unique start, he has quickly integrated into the company and he is already making an impact. Mike, welcome. Mike Berry : Thank you, George, and thanks for that wonderful introduction. First, I also want to express my sympathy to all those who have been impacted by the current health crisis and extend my sincere gratitude to the selfless frontline workers who put themselves in harm\u2019s way to help keep us all safe. The COVID-19 pandemic has made for a very interesting first 60 days for me at NetApp, but the unusual circumstances have only reinforced my initial views of the strong NetApp culture. I have been very impressed with the quality of the team and the level of collaboration and commitment across the entire organization. From day one, it has been clear that this team is all pulling in the same direction with a high level of transparency and accountability and a tireless determination to continue serving our customers across the globe. When you couple this with NetApp\u2019s business model, loyal customer base, go-to-market engine and product development, we are positioned to do great things in the future. Let me start by expressing my deep appreciation to George and the entire Board for giving me this opportunity and to Ron for his help during my unusual onboarding. I\u2019m extremely excited about joining NetApp and look forward to working alongside George and the rest of the talented team, as we continue to drive innovation in data management. In the current environment, it is important to highlight NetApp\u2019s solid liquidity position and business model. NetApp\u2019s healthy balance sheet and considerable free cash flow generation provide us the ability to make strategic decisions that are best aligned with long-term shareholder value. This is particularly critical in times of uncertainty. We closed Q4 with $2.9 billion in cash and short-term investments. As of year-end, we also had approximately $500 million available through our credit facility. And we are confident, we have access to the corporate debt market, if needed. Our strong liquidity position has allowed us to provide extended credit programs to our channel partners during the health crisis. Given this is my first call as NetApp\u2019s CFO, I wanted to walk through how I view capital allocation. Our strong liquidity position and the fact that we generated roughly $1 billion of free cash flow last year, allow us to remain committed to our dividend, which now carries more than a 4% yield. In fiscal 2020, we paid out nearly 50% of our free cash flow to dividends. In the current environment, we believe it is prudent to pause our share repurchase program, which we did in late March, until we have a better sense for the timing and magnitude of the broader economic recovery. Longer-term, share repurchases will play a key role in our capital allocation strategy, with the goal to have buybacks at least offset dilution from our equity plans. Consistent with NetApp\u2019s long history of disciplined M&A, our acquisition strategy will remain focused on bolstering our strategic roadmap, particularly within our Cloud Data Services business. Of course, all of these uses of capital will be balanced against reinvesting in the business for future growth. Before going through our Q4 and fiscal 2020 results, I would like to remind you that I will be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. Despite the demand weakness, logistical challenges and minor supply constraints as a result of COVID-19, we delivered strong gross margins, healthy operating leverage and substantial free cash flow in the fourth quarter. In Q4, net revenue of $1.4 billion decreased 12% year-over-year, including nearly 1 point of currency headwind. It is worth highlighting that our two key strategic focus areas, our Storage business, powered by our industry-leading File, Block and Object Software and Cloud Data Services, both performed considerably better than the rest of the business. Our all-flash revenue of $656 million was down 3% year-over-year. We continue to believe that there is a very healthy runway for all-flash adoption, as only 24% of our installed systems are all-flash. Cloud data services delivered $111 million in ARR, growing 113% year-over-year and an impressive 34% sequentially. Cloud data services customer count now exceeds 3,500, more than doubling from Q4 of last year. Total product revenue of $793 million decreased approximately 21% year-over-year. ELA revenue in Q4 was less than $10 million. Given that ELAs represents such a small portion of our business, we will not be breaking out ELA revenue in future quarters. As you know, over the last year, the timing and magnitude of ELAs has proven extremely difficult to predict. In an effort to have a more predictable forecast, be more conservative and reduce confusion, we will not be including ELAs and guidance going forward. Software maintenance and hardware maintenance revenue of $546 million, was up nearly 4% year-over-year. These two recurring revenue lines comprise roughly 40% of total net revenue. Going forward, we will focus a lot more on our high-margin recurring revenue streams, where renewals play a big role in growth. I have been incredibly impressed with the work the team has done around renewals, implementing a much more rigorous sales motion and simplified quoting system. We ended Q4 with $3.7 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 1% year-over-year. Gross margin of 68%, was up nearly 3 points year-over-year. Product gross margin was 56.4%, an increase of over 1 point year-over-year. The year-over-year improvement was largely driven by an increase in all-flash product mix. The combination of software and hardware maintenance and other services continues to be an incredibly profitable business for us, with gross margin of 83.2%, which was up 1 point year-over-year. The margin expansion was mainly driven by continued leverage in our support model. Q4 operating expenses of $629 million, decreased approximately 8% year-over-year, driven by lower variable compensation associated with the shortfall in revenue. Operating margin was 23.1%, up more than a 0.5 point from Q4 of last year. EPS of $1.19, was down 2% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations was $383 million and free cash flow was $359 million, representing 26% of revenue. During Q4, we repurchased 3.3 million shares at an average price of $49.50, for a total of $161 million. As of the end of Q4, we had $478 million remaining on our original $4 billion buyback authorization. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were $222 million, down 27 million shares year-on-year, representing an 11% decrease. During the quarter, we paid out $105 million in cash dividends. We will maintain our cash dividend of $0.48 per share in Q1. Turning to our full-year 2020 results. Net revenues of $5.4 billion decreased 12% year-over-year, including a 0.5 point of currency headwind. Gross margin of 67.9%, was up nearly three points compared to fiscal 2019. Operating margin of 20.8% decreased nearly 2 points versus fiscal 2019, due to lower-than-anticipated revenues. EPS of $4.05, decreased 10% year-over-year. We generated free cash flow of $936 million in fiscal 2020, which represented 17% of net revenues. We completed $1.4 billion in share repurchases and $439 million in dividends in the fiscal year. And over the last three years, we have returned $5.4 billion to shareholders. Now onto guidance. As you all know, demand visibility has been significantly impacted by COVID-19. As a result, we are not guiding the full-year at this time. We will reassess our ability to provide fiscal 2021 guidance after Q1. With that as a backdrop, we did think it was important to provide boundaries to the demand scenarios we are seeing in the near-term. We expect Q1 net revenues to range between $1.09 billion and $1.24 billion, which at the midpoint, implies a 6% decline in revenues year-over-year, including 1.5 points of currency headwind. We expect consolidated gross margin to range between 67% and 68% and operating margin to be approximately 10%. Assumed in this guidance, our Q1 operating expenses of $660 million to $670 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 19% and expect earnings per share for Q1 to range between $0.36 and $0.44 per share. As a reminder, Q1 has an extra week this year, which adds approximately $30 million to $35 million to both our recurring revenues and total operating expenses for the quarter. The incremental revenue and expenses largely offset each other at the operating income level and thus have minimal impact to EPS. A quick comment on our go-forward expense structure. As George highlighted, we invested in our go-to-market engine by adding 200 primary sales resources over the last three quarters. And we did this without adding incremental dollars to our operating expense envelope. At this time, we have decided not to make any significant structural changes to our expense base until we have better visibility into the duration and magnitude of the current downturn. We continue to closely monitor the situation, which will likely remain very fluid over the next two to three quarters. As we look forward to fiscal 2021, I did want to highlight two key strategic goals for the year. Our cloud connected all-flash portfolio continues to offer customers a unique architecture that bridges on-prem and public cloud environments under a singular ONTAP software platform. While the shape of the economic recovery will largely determine the overall growth rate for the storage industry, our goal for fiscal 2021 is to reestablish share gains in the storage market. In the coming year, we will also continue to grow and invest in our Cloud Data Services business. Fiscal 2020 was a foundational year in launching both Cloud Volumes ONTAP and Cloud Volumes Service across AWS, Azure and Google Cloud. We also acquired two great assets in Talon and Cloud Jumper, expanding the breadth of our cloud data services platform and adding nicely to our overall cloud TAM. We remain confident in cloud data services unique market position. Partner and customer feedback has only reaffirmed our confidence in the size of the opportunity. But to be prudent, we thought best to reset expectations around the ARR ramp, so we are removing the fiscal 2021 target for Cloud Data Services ARR of $400 million to $600 million. We will provide new guidance and trackable metrics for our Cloud Data Services business at our Analyst Day in September. Fiscal 2021 will serve as a critical growth year for the Cloud Data Services franchise, which will be aided by a new dedicated cloud data services sales force. In closing, I want to thank our partners, customers and investors for their continued support. And a special thank you to the NetApp employees for stepping up during this global crisis. It is clearly a unique time to be joining NetApp. I see real opportunity to add value as our business continues to evolve with a clear goal of driving significant long-term value for our shareholders. As George noted, we are planning to host an Analyst Day in September, which will provide a great overview of our strategic initiatives and include an update to our long-term financial model. I\u2019ll now hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris? Kris Newton : Thanks, Mike. We\u2019ll now open the call for Q&A. Please be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to just one question, so we can get to as many people as possible. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Bala Reddy : Hi, thank you for taking my questions. This is Bala Reddy on for Rod. Could you give us some color on demand trends that you\u2019re seeing across different geographies and maybe color on how the order trends have been in the past four weeks in this month, and I\u2019ve got a follow-up. George Kurian : I think if you look across the geographies, the order trends somewhat followed the impact of COVID across the world. I think our Asia Pacific business was first impacted by COVID, particularly in the areas surrounding China. I think we\u2019ve seen that part of the business come back online. Through the course of the quarter, as we said in our prepared remarks, we felt that we were on target until the impact of COVID started to broaden across the globe, and we saw several different things going on. Some customers pulled forward transactions so that they could deploy and be ready before the shelter-in-place took full impact. Others clearly, either deferred transactions or downsized transactions, our supply chain performance was strong. Thanks to some really good work done by our supply chain team. And so, we were able to meet most of the orders that customers wanted within the course of their requirements. From a vertical market perspective, as I said, we cover a broad range of industries, and so there is no single geography or industry that has a material part of our business. I think that when we look at the results from the quarter, financial services and healthcare were strong performers. Automotive, retail meaning traditional retail and oil and gas were weaker through the course of the quarter. And similarly, oil dependent economies were challenged through the course of the quarter. Bala Reddy : Thanks, George. Maybe some color on how the trends have been in the past four weeks in this month? George Kurian : I think, as I said, they were \u2013 we had less visibility into order trajectory in the last four weeks than in the first couple of months, the periods of the couple of months of the quarter. I think, as we look into the \u2013 where we are today, there\u2019s isn\u2019t material change from that, which is why we are being cautious about providing guidance a quarter at a time. I\u2019m trying to be cautious in the commentary around our guidance itself. Mike, do you want to add anything? Mike Berry : No, that\u2019s it. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Simon Leopold : Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to see if maybe you could help bridge the gross margin guidance, and maybe there\u2019s a volume aspect or cost aspect. But I guess, fundamentally, I would believe that we\u2019d see services increasing in the mix. They have good gross margin, and maybe that\u2019s what\u2019s throwing me. On-premises, the mix shift should help gross margin. So, I\u2019m wondering what the offset is? Mike Berry : Yes, Simon, it\u2019s Mike Berry. So, if you look year-over-year, that\u2019s exactly what you do see. I would always encourage you because of seasonality to look year-over-year as it relates to gross margin. So, when you look at total, the slight increase, we get \u2013 you get a little benefit in Q1 year-over-year from the 14th-week, so you have to take that into account. But then the higher mix of services at 80%-plus drives the total gross margin up as it relates to year-over-year, and again seasonality will have a significant influence if you look sequentially, and that\u2019s just not as applicable as the year-over-year numbers. Simon Leopold : Great. And then just as a follow-up. You did mention financing available for some of your partners. And I have a perception NetApp has been less vocal on financing for customers than some of the large IT peers. Just wondering if maybe you could elaborate on how you may be adjusting your financing program to help customers and not just your channel partners? Thank you. George Kurian : We have a broad range of capabilities to meet customers\u2019 needs for OpEx kinds of business models and cash preservation concerns. They range, of course, from cloud data services, which are available on all the leading public cloud platforms, and we saw several customers take advantage not only of the flexibility that the cloud data services portfolio had, but also the rapid time to provision. We have introduced a program called Keystone, which is a subscription offering for enterprise data centers, and we saw some strong wins in that part of our business, as well as a healthy pipeline. And then clearly, we work with partners through managed service offerings, which are typically on a monthly basis payment model. And we have third parties we work with around traditional leasing models for customers. I\u2019m happy to have Mike comment further. Mike Berry : Yes. I think there\u2019s two parts what George walked through as well as just giving extended terms to some of our channel partners as they deal with our end users, and our financial flexibility also helps us their assignment. Simon Leopold : Great. Thank you for taking the questions. Kris Newton : All right. Thank you, Simon. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is now open. Tim Long : Thank you. I was hoping to talk about the cloud data services a little bit. Your numbers do look like some acceleration in the quarter. Just curious about kind of the pulling the longer-term guidance, if we could just get some color around, why maybe the uptake has been a little bit slower? It does seem like you\u2019ve hit most of the GA targets at the big players and the move to cloud obviously is accelerating as you highlighted in the quarter. So maybe just give us a little bit of color as to why you think has that been just a more difficult sell to customers or harder for the sales force? If you can just give us some color on what\u2019s affected the slope of that curve? Thank you. George Kurian : First of all, we feel even more bullish today about the demand for our offerings than we did a year ago. I think that over the last year, as Mike mentioned, we have added a substantial number of customers more than doubled our customer base and there are a lot of net new customers coming to NetApp. We have, as we mentioned, been a year behind where we needed to be in terms of getting the services to general availability. And we still have \u2013 we are still working to get through a completely frictionless sales model together with Microsoft, for example. So there\u2019s really good work being done. We are expanding the number of use cases. We\u2019ve got more data centers being deployed, but we are about a year behind where we felt we would be and that\u2019s been our consistent commentary even in the last quarter. I\u2019ll let Mike comment with regard to the guide.S Mike Berry : Yes. Tim, so as George mentioned, we feel really good about the business. Nice growth in Q4, sequential growth. So it doesn\u2019t reflect us not \u2013 our confidence level. As he mentioned, we\u2019re a little bit behind where we were in the original guide was done. And I would like to be able to address that, as well as kind of the long-term model all at once in September. Hence, we didn\u2019t want to update it now and not do the rest of the business. So that\u2019s why we said, \u201cHey, we will address all of that as it relates to the business when we get together, hopefully in person or virtually in September. Tim Long : Okay, thanks. I\u2019ll just keep it at the one. Kris Newton : All right. Thank you, Tim. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Your line is now open. Matt Sheerin : Yes, thank you. I guess, following up on the cloud data services and the fact that you saw a fairly big chunk of new customers adopting that platform. Is there a cross-selling opportunity in terms of those customers adopting on-premise hardware and services from you? Or is that a different customer base? George Kurian : There\u2019s clearly a set of those customers who have never bought anything from NetApp. Some of those customers are truly digital natives, meaning, they don\u2019t have the concept of an enterprise data center. And there, the cross-sell and up-sell is for the vast majority of those customers. We have a very narrow slice today of their total cloud wallet, meaning, in terms of workloads and we can expand there. Many of the customers also have enterprise data centers. And so our discussions with them are obviously, \u201cHey, if you\u2019re going to use us on the public cloud, why couldn\u2019t you be able to deploy us in your data center?\u201d I\u2019ll give you an example. There\u2019s a several large global companies who have us as a second vendor, not the primary vendor in their enterprise data center, but we are their primary shared platform in the public cloud. They are now giving us a broader range of opportunities in the enterprise data center. So as the COVID crisis abates and we see enterprise data centers being more \u2013 being expanded, we\u2019ll see more share of footprints, at least, that\u2019s our confident belief. Matt Sheerin : Okay. Thank you. That\u2019s it for me. Kris Newton : All right. Thanks, Matt. Next question? Operator : Next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Katy Huberty : Thank you. George, we\u2019re obviously in an unprecedented period of disruption at the macro level, but you are advantaged by a strong balance sheet. So would love to get your thoughts as to whether there\u2019s an opportunity for you to press your advantage and perhaps make some larger investments or do more M&A than you have in the past that come out of this period stronger? George Kurian : Thanks, Katy. I think when we look at the overall profile of our business, we have, as you mentioned, a really strong margin profile in terms of gross margins, reflecting the rich software contribution to our business. I think, as Mike mentioned in terms of capital allocation, we are going to continue to support the dividend at the current level going forward. The place where we will have to reevaluate that is if we see some structural impairment to our free cash flow, which we don\u2019t see at the moment. So we\u2019re going to continue to stay with the dividend. We have hit a pause on the buybacks. We\u2019ve done a lot of buybacks over the last couple of years, almost $3.5 billion, and so we\u2019re going to pause that until we have better visibility into the overall landscape. And we are going to be selective, but we continue to see opportunities to expand our strategic relevance and the portfolio, like you mentioned. So we\u2019re going to continue to balance all of these cases. I would tell you that as we think about the go-forward strategic roadmap, it\u2019s much more tied to software and cloud services. We\u2019re not leaning towards doing horizontal consolidations for scale. I think that, that would not be a primary focus for us. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, Katy. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Your line is now open. Steven Fox : Hi, good afternoon. George, I was wondering if you could just sort of talk about how you\u2019re going to approach some of the vendor incentives you\u2019re providing against the backdrop of having so many industries with uncertain demand? How do you sort of make sure you\u2019re deploying that capital correctly without maybe unnaturally pulling forward revenues? Thanks. George Kurian : I think we have a good handle on the customer discussions that we are engaged in. As I mentioned, one of the areas that we invested in without raising the overall operating expense level of the company was to put primary demand generation, account executives facing customers. So we have a good close dialogue with these customers. For those that want to be able to take advantage of technology without having to deploy large amounts of cash, we are uniquely positioned in the market because of our cloud data services portfolio. They are instantly provisionable. They have the reach and scale of the world\u2019s biggest hyperscale data centers, and in many ways, also allow customers to start their journey on the cloud. That would be our lead offer, right? I think with regard to subscription services and other use cases, we are selective. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re trying to say that at this point in time that we are going to transition our entire business over to a subscription model. I think we need to have that in our portfolio and we\u2019ll have it, but we are selective about qualifying, which customers we provide subscription offerings to. Steven Fox : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much. Kris Newton : Thanks, Steve. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. George Iwanyc : Thank you for taking my question. George, expanding on your comments on the sales addition, can you give us a sense of the 200 additions, how they\u2019re ramping the productivity and maybe how trends have been in North America? George Kurian : I would tell you that, as we said, we were going to bring on 200 primary demand generation headcount, starting from the beginning of Q2 of FY 2020 through the end of Q1 of FY 2021, which is the current quarter. We have accomplished that objective a little bit ahead of plan. We are in the process of enabling those sales headcount. I would tell you they typically, as we have said before, take three to four quarters to get up to full productivity and we feel good about the work they\u2019re doing so far. I think that we\u2019ve also said that we would focus them on new customer acquisition, some on cloud and clearly on the strongest places in our portfolio, which is our all-flash arrays and our object storage and they have seen good results in the second-half of this year. So as we have started to deploy and focus these resources, we are starting to see some good underlying trends in the business. George Iwanyc : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, George. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi with Lake Street. Your line is now open. Eric Martinuzzi : Yes. I wanted to focus on public sector. First, just a clarification and then a question. I\u2019m pretty sure public sector includes healthcare, but just to clarify that? And then secondly, what are you seeing in pipeline? I\u2019m particularly interested in healthcare with regards to elective procedures impacting their budgeting cycles. And then within SLED, maybe the tentative budgets with higher ed, government revenue issues. Just focus for a moment if you would on the public sector for me? George Kurian : Not all of our healthcare business is categorized as public sector. Certainly, there are pieces of it like University Hospitals, State University Hospitals that are in public sector, but not the whole business, right? I think, if I look at healthcare overall, there were \u2013 we had a lot of customer wins because of the strength of our solutions for digital imaging, the advancements that we are doing with NVIDIA around AI for imaging, and there are lots of unique technologies in our ONTAP operating system that enables that type of a workflow to be really successful. The second is, with regard to the healthcare customer base, we\u2019ve also stepped up our support for them. I think they are highly stressed that the amount of work, so I don\u2019t think there was any sort of budgetary issue we saw. It was really just the capacity of work they are doing to sustain their patient levels and the sort of the level of work that they\u2019re sort of patient-facing workforce has. I think that\u2019s really about healthcare. With regard to the public sector, again, we have a broad book of business, covering both federal, state and local, government and education. Within education, we saw several customer wins around the rapid movement of that part of our world to a remote working, remote education model. And so both our private cloud solutions and certainly our public cloud, modern workplace solutions benefited from that move. I would tell you that visibility is \u2013 it\u2019s choppy, right? It\u2019s across the board. It\u2019s a little choppy. I think in our public sector business, we had a couple of deals that did not close within the quarter, just because of the logistics of being able to try to bring teams together to close the transaction. Eric Martinuzzi : And then, as far as the guidance, that\u2019s captured in the guidance across all three of that? George Kurian : That\u2019s correct. Eric Martinuzzi : Got it. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, Eric. Next? Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Jim Suva : Thank you very much. George, you mentioned your sales force ramping, which is quite impressive, which is good. I had a plan and such like that. I\u2019m just wondering in the COVID-19 environment, which nobody anticipated, does it make it harder or still the same to regain share and efforts? I\u2019m thinking about you have all the new persons and hims in hers in place. Are they able to start now out there cracking into some new companies and new market shares? Or does this \u2013 congratulations, you\u2019re ahead of plan, but the coronavirus makes it a little harder to keep knocking on doors and get new design wins. Just wondering about how we sort this all out, because it seems like you\u2019re really ahead of plan now? George Kurian : I think that if you think about the coronavirus as a \u2013 as an opportunity to disrupt, you can lean into these conversations with customers, right? One of the things that we see with the use of remote working tools is that our sales teams can bring the best of NetApp to any customer anywhere in the globe. Meaning, they can bring the CEO now on any given day to a discussion in Asia, Europe and North America, all in the course of a single day. That wasn\u2019t possible in the old world, right? So, we are trying to lean into the changes. As I said, we feel good about the progress of our acquired districts, which was a key place that we were targeting some of our headcount. Even in Q4, they had good performance. We have been focused on the cloud business as a place to continue to ramp our success that had good results. And I think that you should expect from us and as we have demonstrated over the past several years, we are disciplined operators, right? So if we don\u2019t see a return on that investment, we\u2019ll certainly look to do something else with it. And so you should expect Mike and I to stay focused on the evolving nature of the market and we\u2019ll adjust accordingly. Jim Suva : Thank you for the details and explanation. It\u2019s greatly appreciated. Thank you, George Kurian : Thanks, Jim. Kris Newton : Thank you, Jim. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Matthew Cabral : Thank you very much. Given the softer demand environment, I\u2019m wondering if you can talk about if you\u2019ve seen any changes in terms of pricing or other competitive behavior since the middle of March? George Kurian : No, I think that the strong gross margin profile of our business is reflective of both the discipline of our sales force, as well as the differentiation of our products. I think we have an extraordinarily good technology portfolio. As I said, in the Storage business, we have the leadership position, not second, not third, the leadership position in five block object technologies, which is the full range and we have uniquely differentiated cloud data services. So, yes, the market is always competitive. But I think that, as we have demonstrated over several quarters now, product gross margins continue to be an area of focus for us. We have incented the sales force to stay disciplined around discounting, and you saw that through the quarter, and we\u2019re going to take it a quarter at a time and keep staying disciplined around that. Mike, you want to end? Mike Berry : No, nothing more. Kris Newton : All right. Thanks, Matt. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Lou Miscioscia with Daiwa. Your line is now open. Louis Miscioscia : Okay, thank you. As you look at how you\u2019ve been able to get your people to work from home with COVID-19, and you don\u2019t have to be given guidance here. But do you see any long-term changes that you will make this actually something more permanent? And then in the long run, would that actually change some of your cost structure either for some of your real estate or anything else? Any thoughts here would just be interesting and helpful? Thank you. George Kurian : I think, first of all, I want to thank the NetApp team. I\u2019m \u2013 I could never have been more proud than what I saw from our team this past quarter. Across the board, we started our planning to deal with the COVID crisis in January when we first saw the impact in China. And as a result of working from home has been pretty seamless on everything from engineering deliverables to the incredible work that our support team and our supply chain teams have done, we have for the most part being able to operate without disruption. I think the place that we are continuing to focus in on is the ability to engage customers through a digital medium. And I think that we are new to it just like everybody else, right, but we see opportunity there. I think with regard to the long-term model, it\u2019s a little bit early to tell. I think we are certainly cautious about returning our workforce to the office. I think we\u2019re going to do it step wise with the priority being the safety of our employees. And so we see that it will be a hybrid model with a large percentage of our employees working in at home or other flexible locations of their choice. And we\u2019ll factor that over time as it settles into what the new normal looks like. We\u2019re certainly going to factor that in over time into what we can do to best serve our employees and customers. Mike Berry : And on that, Lou, it\u2019s Mike. I would just add, to George\u2019s point, it\u2019s all about making sure our employees are safe and dealing with it now. As you look forward, companies have a lot of areas to look into, be it real estate, be it travel, marketing events. What does that mean for the sales team? But I think it\u2019s way too early for us to be able to tell that. We need to figure out how this goes over the next, call it, several months or quarters, and then a lot of companies will be asking those very questions. Louis Miscioscia : Okay. And good luck with the new job. Mike Berry : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, Lou. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is now open. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes, thanks for taking my question. Two follow-ups. George, with four consecutive quarters of year-over-year decline in all-flash array. Do you think the worst is behind us and we should see a rebound and hopefully a year-over-year growth sooner than later? And I have a follow-up? George Kurian : It\u2019s difficult for me to give you specific guidance, given the volatility of COVID. I will tell you that our all-flash SaaS business, which is the predominant part of our all-flash array business has started to perform much better as we have driven focus and as we have driven enterprise sales coverage. That doesn\u2019t show the overall all-flash array number yet. But the trends underneath the all-flash array numbers are much healthier than what the overall number shows. So we\u2019re encouraged by that. And I think we\u2019re going to stay focused, as we\u2019ve said, on exploiting our position there and getting it back to growth. From an installed base perspective, it is still a small percentage, right? So all-flash installed base is at 24%. So we got a long way to go. And so we\u2019re going to stay focused on using all the levels that are disposal to gain share. Mehdi Hosseini : Sure. Great. Thanks for detail. And I have a follow-up. It seems to me that certain aspect of work from home is going to be permanent with us. And in that context, virtualization of VDI is going to be in a secular demand. You\u2019ve recently made an acquisition here. How should I think about this specific sector? And how do you expect that to grow for you? There has been a lot of emphasis on all-flash array, cloud data services. But I think that you\u2019re doing something in VDI, and I want to hear more and maybe you can quantify it for us? Thank you. George Kurian : Yes. As part of our cloud data services portfolio, what we said consistently is, we\u2019re going to get the fundamental infrastructure into the \u2013 into all the major hyperscalers, which is our cloud volumes platform. We were then going to add data services on top of that, and we\u2019ve added several organically built backup and data protection services. We\u2019ve done cloud governance and compliance services. And now what we are doing is, we are building out a modern workplace solution that combines a global file consolidation solution that we acquired in Q4 called Talon and a virtual desktop infrastructure and desktop as a service solution provider called Cloud Jumper that we acquired in Q1 of fiscal year 2021. The combination of cloud volumes, Talon and Cloud Jumper, gives us an extremely strong offering in the market. And it\u2019s particularly suited to the broad transition of virtual desktop services to what we see as Windows virtual desktop, which is a new offering created by Microsoft to enable customers to have much more efficient virtual desktop infrastructures on the Azure cloud. And so you\u2019ll see us tell you more about that in the coming quarters, but we\u2019re really excited and we saw some significant customer wins. Cloud Jumper had been a longstanding partner of NetApp, and we had worked together with them to do many cloud deals before and now that they are integrated into NetApp. We think that, that should accelerate our business further. Mehdi Hosseini : Great. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, Mehdi. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Nehal Chokshi : Thank you, and congrats on a what I think is a good quarter, given the conditions. On the high-end of the guidance that appears rather bullish, where part of revenue goes from negative 20% in the most recent quarter to probably around flattish year-over-year. So what are you seeing that underpins this rather strong uptick in that year-over-year growth profile? Mike Berry : Yes. So this \u2013 Nehal, this is Mike. So a couple of things on that. Keep in mind that, that in revenue, mix matters a lot. We do get 30 to 35 from the extra week that\u2019s in the revenue numbers. So if you look year-over-year, take that into account. And then in Q1, because the product revenue from a seasonal perspective is lower. This is where the strength of our recurring revenue comes in as well. So that, that helps us also on that range. So that\u2019s really how we got to that, call it, high-end of the guidance range, really driven by the mix, the strength of recurring revenue and then the benefit from the 14th-week. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. So then the follow-on there is on the low-end of the guidance, does that embed a deterioration in the macro? Mike Berry : So I have George talked about, it\u2019s really a continuation of what we saw in the latter part, call it, of our Q4. So it assumes that what we saw in April and later March continues into Q1. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, Nehal. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Nik Todorov with Longbow Research. Your line is now open. Nikolay Todorov : Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. On the cloud data services, what sort of incentives do you have for customers that have adopted cloud data services to increase their NetApp consumption on-prem? And also related to that, I think CDS and on-prem buyers within the same customer, two distinct departments. Can you talk about how and if the sales cycle of cross-selling on-prem systems to CDS customers is different, if at all? George Kurian : I don\u2019t think, first of all, some of the CDS customers are acquired through Microsoft. And so incentive that are provided to those customers are really provided by Microsoft to deploy those workloads on the Azure Cloud, right? I think with regard to cross-selling them to an on-prem environment, it really is more of a relationship and a customer confidence discussion rather than a specific kind of incentives \u2013 commercial incentives. I\u2019ll give you an example. We are certified to run SAP on both the Google Cloud as well as the Azure Cloud. And many customers use \u2013 are starting to use SAP on those cloud provider platform with NetApp. They may not run their entire SAP environment on those clouds. They may run a portion of it, for example, analytics or business intelligence or something like that. And so we get to go and tell them listen, you\u2019re using SAP on Azure, on NetApp and you like the technology and the benefits. Why wouldn\u2019t you use us for your transaction processing environment on-premise? So it\u2019s more of a relationship and a customer confidence and awareness of benefit we get in specific incentives. Nikolay Todorov : Okay. Just if I can sneak one more, I think, it\u2019s important. You talked about moving to a frictionless sales model, especially with Microsoft. Can you please elaborate a little bit on that? George Kurian : Today, we have, given the importance of the workloads that we serve, these are production environments that we support in customers. We have a, what we call whitelisting requirements with Microsoft. So there\u2019s essentially, the customer has to register with a Microsoft website that then creates a manual provisioning step where NetApp has to call the customer and make sure that that\u2019s \u2013 customers ready to go live. I think as we have scaled the business, we are working closely with Microsoft to remove that requirement, so that we can automatically provision workloads on to NetApp Cloud Volumes. And we\u2019re looking forward to that when that happens. There\u2019s still work to be done, but both teams are working actively to remove that requirement. Nikolay Todorov : Got it. Thanks. Good luck, guys. Kris Newton : Thank you, Nik. Next question? Operator : Our next question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Your line is now open. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much for taking my question. I\u2019m not to stay on the cloud topic too much. But I\u2019m just curious, given the focus, how much are you thinking what you\u2019re going to be doing in the coming few quarters, is going to be acquisition versus partnerships versus internal development? I\u2019m just trying to get a handle on exactly how you\u2019re really thinking about expanding cloud, or if it\u2019s more of just taking what you\u2019ve got now and expanding the sales of it? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you. George Kurian : We\u2019ve always been pretty disciplined about the uses of cash. We\u2019re going to continue to do that. I think where we do acquisitions, we are very selective. We spend a lot of time to make sure that both strategic and cultural fit, as well as financial benefits to our shareholders over time. So we\u2019re going to continue to stay disciplined on acquisitions. I think with regard to the cloud portfolio itself, the vast majority of our cloud revenue today is through organic development. We feel that we have taken \u2013 unlike anyone else in the industry, taken the world\u2019s best storage and data management operating system, made it cloud enabled and integrated it into every major data center of the world\u2019s three biggest public cloud. And not only that, two of the big three are actually selling it as their own service. And that has been the big amount of work we\u2019ve done. Now that, that foundation is in place and starting to scale, we are following a pretty disciplined set of chess moves to add capabilities to it. A large number of those capabilities are organic, and then we\u2019ll be selective about inorganic. Shannon Cross : Okay. Thank you. That was helpful. And then I was curious about the competitive landscape. Your competitor launched a new mid-range platform that they believe will be a fairly big game changer, at least, for their installed base. I\u2019m curious and they obviously want to gain share, sort of how are you thinking about what\u2019s out there right now? And what kind of a competitive environment do you expect in the coming quarters? Thank you. George Kurian : It\u2019s always competitive. To this particular platform, it is a long delayed and still very much incomplete. And so we see it as complete opportunity for us. Now that they\u2019ve announced it, we\u2019re going after them. Stay tuned. Shannon Cross : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Shannon. Next question? Operator : Our last question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is now open. Ananda Baruah : Hi, George. Hi, Mike. Thanks for taking the question. Yes, just one for me. And George, I apologize if this was already asked. I was kind of moving between a couple of different calls this afternoon. How does sort of what\u2019s taken place, impact, how you guys are approaching your sales force initiatives and your enterprise customer expansion initiative? Would just love any context around that and how you guys are thinking about that? Thanks. George Kurian : We clearly see COVID-19 accelerating a set of transitions in the market. I think the most important one of those is the digital transformation of our customers. And that digital transformation is highly data-driven, right? You cannot be successful in digital transformation without modern data infrastructure, and that creates opportunity for us. There are a series of market transitions that follow from that, right? There\u2019s operating system transition. There is major database migrations going on. And, of course, there are competitive product transitions that are technology transitions like the 10-K replacement cycle. We\u2019re going to attack in those transitions. So we\u2019d be pretty laser-focused on getting our teams to focus on our strongest product offerings, and we\u2019re working to attack those market transitions and be as productive as we can. And we\u2019ve seen good results from that in Q3 and Q4 net new customer ads and we\u2019re going to continue to stay focused. And we\u2019ll provide you an update at the next earnings call and our Analyst Day. Ananda Baruah : And that\u2019s helpful, George. And how about net new sales people add? George Kurian : We are on track, as I mentioned in my comments, we completed the 200 net new demand generation headcount without increase to operating expenses by Q4. So within Q4, one quarter ahead of schedule, we\u2019ve met the commitments we\u2019ve made to ourselves and to you. And we\u2019re focused on getting them productive. The early cohorts are starting to show results. And so we feel good about where we are. So thank you for your questions. Ananda Baruah : Thanks very much. Kris Newton : All right. Thank you, Ananda. I\u2019ll turn it over to George for some closing remarks. George Kurian : In the face of the current healthcare crisis, we will continue to make strategic moves that position us to emerge stronger than before, while maintaining the operational discipline you have come to expect from NetApp. Our storage system powered by our industry-leading file block and object software and our cloud data services have clear compelling competitive advantages and significant market presence. To further exploit our leading position, we are expanding our reach with a dedicated cloud sales focus, greater enterprise sales coverage, and dedicated customer acquisition resources. In Q4, we continue to see progress in our cloud business and success with our dedicated acquired districts. Getting our industry-leading portfolio in front of more buyers will enable us to emerge from this crisis stronger than ever. I hope that you all stay safe and healthy. And in closing, I believe that by working together with creativity and resilience, we will find together a path forward out of this crisis. I want to thank you, our investors, our partners, customers, and the NetApp\u2019s team for the amazing work that we have done together this past few months. We hope to see you at our Analyst Day in September. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Joelle, and I will be your conference call coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. I will now turn the call over to Kris Newton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please proceed, Ms. Newton. Kris Newton : Thank you for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Mike Berry. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our Web site at netapp.com. During today\u2019s call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the second quarter fiscal year 2021; our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability and shareholder returns; and our ability to return to growth, gain share, and scale our business, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially for a variety of reasons, including macroeconomic and market conditions, including the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the IT capital spending environment, and our ability to expand our total available market, capitalize on our Data Fabric strategy, generate cash flow and execute our capital allocation strategy. Please also refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC and available on our Web site, specifically our most recent Form 10-K for fiscal year 2020, including the management\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and risk factor sections and our current reports on Form 8-K. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are posted on our Web site. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to George. George Kurian : Thanks, Kris, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We hope that you all are staying safe and healthy. As we navigate the health, economic and social changes impacting all of us, we continue to focus on what we can control and improve our operational execution. In the face of an uncertain environment, NetApp performed well in the quarter, with revenue, operating margin and EPS all exceeding our guidance. I want to thank all of our employees for their hard work in the midst of this pandemic. Due to the global pandemic, the macroeconomic and IT spending environments remain challenging, consistent with what we saw exiting Q4. Despite these pressures, enterprises are prioritizing transformational and hybrid cloud projects, which drove our momentum as customers turn to NetApp to help them accelerate these plans. At NetApp, we work hard to be the best partner to our customers, a value that is even more important during these particularly challenging times. We continue to deliver heightened support for customers delivering vital public health and safety services, first responders and public sector institutions. For IT teams affected by the pandemic, we are offering 25 terabytes of NetApp Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud free of charge. We also extended our partner financing program to assist partners and customers in managing their cash flow. Uncertainty remains high, but we are moving into a new normal and adjusting to operate in a virtual environment. The majority of NetApp employees are working from home and have quickly built the muscle of interacting with each other, our customers and our partners remotely. Our sales teams are getting in front of buyers to meet and build demand. The number of Executive Briefing Center visits, now held virtually, increased by more than 50% over briefings held in Q1 a year ago. We also saw a doubling in the number of prospects in our virtual Executive Briefing Centers compared to in-person meetings last year. And our reinvigorated Run to NetApp competitive takeout program delivered strong Q1 results with good growth in future opportunities. The improvements we made to sales coverage in FY20 and the tighter focus on execution are starting to pay off. Our customers are also adapting to the new normal. Companies are moving beyond the initial response to the pandemic of operationalizing work from home. They are now looking to accelerate digital transformations to drive competitive advantage by delivering services and products remotely, reaching customers through digital means and optimizing remote operations and collaboration. The acceleration of digital transformations means more enterprises are managing IT environments both on-premises and in the cloud. NetApp leverages our rich data-centric software innovation to help customers thrive in this hybrid cloud world. We help them move applications to the cloud significantly faster than any other vendor, rapidly deploy business continuity solutions, enable remote workforces to collaborate and accelerate application software development. We bring enterprise-grade data services to the cloud and the simplicity and the flexibility of the cloud to the enterprise data center. With our data fabric strategy, we help customers tackle the challenges of hybrid cloud. No matter where a customer is on their hybrid cloud journey, NetApp can help them achieve their goals. As I stated on the Q4 call, we have two clear priorities in fiscal year '21; returning to growth in our storage business powered by share gains from our industry-leading file, block and object software and scaling our highly differentiated cloud services business. We will exploit competitive transitions, the continued growth of the all-flash array market, and the accelerated shift to cloud to expand the use of our products and services. We continue to make great progress in our cloud business. Customers are now beginning to deploy critical workloads in the cloud, which drives requirements for enterprise-grade capabilities. We bring nearly three decades of enterprise tested, data-centric software innovation to the cloud. Cloud providers recognize this and this is why they are choosing to partner with us. Customers also recognize this and this is why they are choosing NetApp to help them accelerate their digital transformation and cloud roadmaps. Leading with cloud in the marketplace, enables us to reach both installed base customers and new-to-NetApp customers. In Q1, roughly half of the new-to-NetApp customers came in through our cloud business. New customers, growth at existing customers, and an expanded portfolio drove an acceleration of our cloud ARR to $178 million, an increase of 192% year-over-year. In Q1, we acquired CloudJumper, a provider of cloud-based virtual desktop services; and Spot, a leader in compute management and cost optimization on the public clouds. In addition to extending our value proposition to cover more of customers\u2019 cloud spend, these acquisitions bring strong talent with cloud DNA to our marketing, sales and engineering teams, and they are driving increased interest in NetApp. More customers are coming to us because they are excited by our cloud strategy and ability to help them deploy applications and optimize compute and storage in the cloud. As I\u2019ve said many times, our cloud services make us a more attractive strategic partner to customers and help us gain share in the enterprise data center. Our industry-leading storage operating system software, ONTAP, is key to our success in the cloud and on-premises. ONTAP is the most powerful, most cloud-connected, and most efficient storage operating system on the market. Not only do we provide customers with a consistent operating system across data center and cloud to unify their hybrid cloud, we provide them with the flexibility of a cloud-like purchasing experience through our Keystone service. One of the key features of ONTAP is FabricPool, which allows customers to create policies for the automatic tiering of infrequently accessed data to a more cost-effective tier such as Azure, AWS, Google, or any S3 target, including our object storage solution, StorageGRID. During these uncertain economic times, customers are finding even greater value in our ability to help them take advantage of high-performance all-flash arrays while reducing total cost of ownership through automated tiering to a lower cost cloud or object tier. This and other industry-leading capabilities helped drive strong growth for both StorageGRID and the A-series all-flash FAS array. Based on the strong 34% year-over-year growth in our all-flash business, we expect we have gained share in this important market. NetApp is uniquely positioned to help customers unlock the best of cloud for their digital transformation. We are building on a strong foundation of industry-leading data-centric software innovation, trusted customer relationships and an open-ecosystem approach that is strengthened by partnerships with the leading public cloud companies who endorse our Data Fabric Strategy. With the ongoing pandemic, the near future remains uncertain for many companies, and no one knows when we will return to a more normal and predictable environment. Despite the uncertainties, one thing is clear. Data is growing in scale and importance. We help the world\u2019s leading organizations solve the challenge of managing their most critical data. In closing, I want to reiterate my confidence for NetApp\u2019s future. We have strengthened our leadership team, broadened our portfolio, and enhanced our partnerships. We are listening to the market and customers and will continue to respond to their requirements with speed and agility. We will continue to be agile in our response to the market conditions created by the pandemic while positioning NetApp to address the long-term opportunity. Our strong business model and disciplined management supports our ability to accomplish our strategic objectives. We are tightly aligned to our customers\u2019 priorities and deeply committed to creating value for our customers and shareholders alike. Finally, I want to call out a couple of key events happening this quarter. I hope that you will all be able to join our Virtual Analyst Day on September 16. You can register from our Investor Relations Web site. Our flagship user conference, INSIGHT, will be fully virtual October 26 to 29. We hope you can tune in to hear more about how NetApp helps customers unlock the best of cloud. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Mike to walk you through the results of the quarter. Mike Berry : Thank you, George. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I\u2019ll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. As George noted, despite the continued macro uncertainty in Q1 as a result of COVID-19, we delivered revenue, operating margin and EPS above the high-end of guidance. Importantly, solid execution by the sales team, in a very difficult environment, yielded Q1 billings of $1.15 billion, up 6% year-over-year. In Q1, net revenue of $1.3 billion increased 5% year-over-year, including a point of currency headwind. Our two key strategic focus areas; our storage business, powered by our industry-leading file, block and object software, and Public Cloud Services, both outperformed the market in the quarter. Our all-flash revenue of $567 million was up 34% year-over-year, nicely positioning us for share gains in the quarter. We remain confident in the growth opportunity for all-flash adoption. At the end of Q1, 25% of our installed systems were all-flash, providing a healthy runway as customers continue to embrace the cloud-connectivity and investment protection offered by our flash solutions. Public Cloud Services delivered an impressive $178 million in ARR, growing 192% year-over-year and 60% sequentially. Our recent acquisitions of Spot, CloudJumper and Talon contributed a total of $44 million of ARR as of the end of the quarter. Even excluding these acquisitions, the growth of our Public Cloud Services business accelerated to 120% year-over-year. We plan to provide an updated framework for our Public Cloud Services opportunity at our upcoming virtual Analyst Day. Total product revenue of $627 million decreased approximately 3% year-over-year. In the quarter, we saw growth in our largest global enterprise accounts as customers initiated digital transformation and hybrid cloud projects. To provide improved visibility into the value created by our high-margin software franchise, we are now breaking out product revenues between software and hardware. Software product revenue of $311 million increased 2% year-over-year, driven by an increase in our software-rich all-flash FAS. Hardware product revenue of $316 million decreased 7% year-over-year, as spinning disk solutions continued to decline. The engineering DNA of NetApp and the value we provide to customers and shareholders is grounded in software. We will continue to highlight and invest in this innovation engine. Software maintenance and hardware maintenance revenue of $608 million was up 14% year-over-year and up 6% year-over-year when adjusted for the approximately $40 million related to the extra week in the quarter. These two recurring revenue lines comprised roughly 47% of total net revenue. When combined, software revenue and recurring maintenance revenue totaled $919 million in Q1, representing 71% of total revenue. We ended Q1 with $3.6 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 3% year-over-year as we continued to grow our installed base. Gross margin of 68% was up nearly 1 point year-over-year. Product gross margin was 51.4%, a decrease of 2 points year-over-year and in-line with our expectations. The year-over-year decline was driven by materially higher NAND costs and COVID-related pricing trends. We believe both of these headwinds are transitory in nature. However, given the uncertainty in the macro environment, we are cautiously assuming that a combination of these factors will persist throughout the remainder of fiscal '21. In the interim, we will continue to focus on reinforcing our strategy of selling on the value of our solutions. The combination of software and hardware maintenance and other services continues to be a very profitable and growing business for us, with gross margin of 83.4%, up 1 point year-over-year. The margin expansion was driven by continued leverage in our support model and exhibits the strong margin profile of a business with a software and recurring revenue model. Q1 operating expenses of $673 million increased approximately 3% year-over-year, driven by the incremental $30 million associated with the extra week in Q1 and higher variable compensation resulting from the better than expected revenue and profitability. Operating margin was 16.3%, up 2 points from Q1 of last year. EPS of $0.73 was up 12% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations was $240 million and free cash flow was $188 million, representing 14% of revenue. Cash flow from operations included a one-time tax payment of $57 million related to acquisitions. Excluding this item, operating cash flow would have been $297 million and free cash flow would have been $245 million, or 19% of revenue. During the quarter we paid out $107 million in cash dividends, representing 57% of free cash flow. As we noted on the Q4 call, we believe it is prudent to pause our share repurchase program until we have a better sense for the timing and magnitude of the broader economic recovery. Weighted average diluted shares outstanding were 222 million, down 21 million shares year-over-year, representing a 9% decrease. We will maintain our cash dividend of $0.48 per share in Q2. We ended Q1 with $3.8 billion in cash and short-term investments. As you know, during the quarter we raised $2 billion in long-term debt. As of the end of the quarter, we used approximately $900 million of our debt raise to reduce our commercial paper balance and pay down 2021 senior debt maturities. The debt raise further enhances our already strong liquidity position, while also providing financial flexibility from additional domestic cash balances during the current economic environment. To be clear, even with this added liquidity, we will maintain our long history of disciplined M&A. Now to guidance. We expect Q2 net revenues to range between $1.225 billion and $1.375 billion, which at the midpoint implies a 5% decline in revenues year-over-year and includes 1 point of currency tailwind. As a reminder, the maintenance revenue benefit in Q1 from the extra week will not repeat in Q2. As a result, we expect our total maintenance revenue in Q2 to grow year-over-year while being down approximately $30 million sequentially from Q1. As a result of this sequential mix shift between product and maintenance revenues, we expect consolidated gross margin to range between 66% and 67%. We expect operating margin to be approximately 16% in Q2. Assumed in this guidance are operating expenses of $655 million to $665 million including $20 million related to our recent acquisitions. We anticipate our non-GAAP tax rate to be between 16% and 17%. And we expect earnings per share for Q2 to range between $0.66 and $0.74 per share. Assumed in this guidance is interest expense of $15 million to $20 million, driven by increased interest expense from our recent debt offering. As a reminder, Q2 tends to be our seasonal trough for free cash flow. This is further compounded by our annual cash tax payments associated with repatriation tax reform. Q1 earnings clearly came in better than expected. When comparing our Q2 EPS guide relative to the Q1 print, please remember the items I walked through earlier as they materially impact the normal sequential compares. As promised, we will be very disciplined around our cost structure. As outlined in our 8-K filing today, we are realigning resources and investments to continue to optimize our business to fund our biggest strategic priorities; returning to growth in our storage software and systems business, while scaling Public Cloud Services. Going forward, we will remain disciplined around our OpEx envelope as we look for reinvestment opportunities that allow us to position the company for long-term success. Also noted in today\u2019s 8-K filing is the departure of Scott Allen, Senior Vice President and Chief Accounting Officer. I want to personally thank Scott for all of his contributions to NetApp over the past four years. He will definitely be missed. We wish Scott the best in the next chapter of his career. In closing, I want to reiterate our confidence in our strategic roadmap and our commitment to continue to evolve NetApp into a cloud-led company, building on our rich data-centric software heritage. We believe this transition, coupled with solid execution, will drive significant long-term value for our shareholders. We hope all of you can join us at our upcoming Virtual Analyst Day on September 16. I\u2019ll now hand the call back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris? Kris Newton : Thanks, Mike. We\u2019ll now open the call for Q&A. Please be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to just one question so we can get to as many people as possible. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is now open. Amit Daryanani : Thanks a lot for taking my question, guys. I will stick to one question. I guess just a question on your cloud services ARR metrics that you guys gave out. It\u2019s obviously really impressive even if I take the deals out, I think it\u2019s up mid-20% sequentially, 120% growth year-over-year. Can you perhaps maybe help us understand how much of that growth do you think is coming from existing customers as they migrate to off-premise and kind of taking their ONTAP solution with them versus net new customers \u2013 net new logo wins that are coming to you? So is there a way to break that growth down between existing customers versus net new customers, that would be really helpful? George Kurian : We saw growth in the cloud business from a lot of new customers new to NetApp where about half of our new to NetApp customers for the quarter came through our cloud business and a good chunk of the cloud customers were new workloads, meaning new wallet in accounts where we have presence. So the substitution of on-prem workloads to the public cloud was the smallest part of the growth of our overall cloud business. We are seeing the use of cloud increasingly for disaster protection and business continuum purposes. We\u2019ve had several wins during the quarter where customers combine our on-premise all-flash array business with a flexible disaster protection copy in the cloud. So we\u2019re very, very pleased with the progress in our cloud business. Our hyperscalers are helping us scale. We\u2019re getting new logos, new wallets in existing customers and building new architectures for customers as well. Kris Newton : All right. Thanks, Amit. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Rod Hall : Yes. Hi. Thanks for the question. I wanted to start off back to the CDS run rate and just ask maybe, George, could you just comment a little bit on Azure NetApp Files? It seems like as much as that\u2019s growing 120%, it\u2019s about the same growth rate year-over-year as last quarter. And I thought \u2013 kind of when we started this journey, I thought that the addressable market of that was quite a bit larger and I just wonder if you still believe it\u2019s a pretty big addressable market, is it blow on the come [ph] or is it on track with what you expected, maybe just comment on that. Then I have a follow up. George Kurian : We\u2019ve always said that we are moving customers\u2019 most important workloads to the cloud. So these workloads are incredibly sticky once they\u2019re deployed in the cloud, but they require planning and deliberations before you do that. What we saw through the course of the quarter again was sequential acceleration of our cloud storage business where not only did our business with Microsoft grow, but our business with the other hyperscalers were also up to really good starts. We are seeing the software-based solutions which complement the high-performance Azure NetApp Files use cases growing nicely and our acquisitions are allowing us access to net new customers and new wallets, the compute wallet [indiscernible] desktop as a service wallet in customer. So I couldn\u2019t be more pleased about the progress. We will tell you more about the long-term expectations of our cloud business at our Virtual Analyst Day. Rod Hall : Okay. And then for a follow up, I wanted to just double check. It looks like \u2013 you haven\u2019t mentioned ELA, so I assume in the July quarter there is very little or \u2013 that I just wonder Mike if you could just clarify the ELA number for the quarter? And then also connected to that, the core product margins in the guidance, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d be willing to tell us what you think the trajectory there is just so we can kind of get our heads around that? I know you made the comment on gross margins, but anything you can give us on what you\u2019re thinking on core product gross margin trajectory would be helpful? Thanks. Mike Berry : Sure, Rod. So on the first one on ELA \u2013 so it lasted until the second question, so that\u2019s good. What I would say is we told you last quarter that we are not going to discuss ELAs. My comment there would be if we do anything of significance size, you absolutely will see it in the financial statements, you\u2019ll see it in margin and also now with us breaking out software revenue as a part of product revenue, you\u2019ll also see it there. So you\u2019ll be able to track that for any significant ELAs going forward. On core product, so we\u2019ve guided to a pretty consistent core product margin as it relates to the areas that we discussed, NAND pricing as well as COVID pricing. Given the uncertainty in the economy, we are conservatively assuming something relatively similar going forward. We do expect there to be a little bit of help on NAND pricing as we go through the rest of the year, but that\u2019s a little out of our control, Rod. It\u2019s really based on industry supply and demand. Rod Hall : Great. Okay. Thanks a lot, Mike. That\u2019s helpful. Kris Newton : All right. Thanks, Rod. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman with Cowen. Your line is now open. Sam Reiff : Hi. This is Sam on for Karl. I was just wondering if you could give the puts and takes on the OpEx guide in context of the restructuring program that should begin hitting the P&L this coming quarter per the press release? I\u2019m aware that last quarter had an extra week, but I would have guessed that OpEx would have been guided a bit lower than what you did based on the savings. And then related to that, could you guys characterize how the heads that you\u2019ve been adding through the year are gaining traction or efficiency in this relatively difficult selling environment? Thank you. Mike Berry : Okay. Hi, Sam. It\u2019s Mike. I\u2019ll take the first one. So when you look at the guide for OpEx, the midpoint of the guide about 660, last year we did about 631, so I\u2019ll do a year-over-year for you is that the acquisitions will add about 20 million of expenses year-over-year. So that is something obviously new year-over-year and that\u2019s all three of them together. We will have higher variable pay. Last year from a bonus and a commission perspective, the accruals were quite low given the performance. And then that will be offset by about 15 million of savings from the restructuring. Keep in mind that that\u2019s only two of three months that we\u2019ll get the credit for. So that\u2019s your year-over-year walk on OpEx. George Kurian : The second question that you had asked was about the productivity of the team that we hired. They are deployed and they are contributing well to our business. You see that strength in both for the enterprise storage systems in software business as well as the growing contribution of our cloud business. So we\u2019re pleased we\u2019re off to a good start and we\u2019re excited that the momentum that those heads add to our business. Sam Reiff : Got it. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Sam. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is now open. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. The first one has to do with some color on the October quarter. If I just take your commentary, it suggests that product revenue included ASA which show a higher decline on a year-over-year basis, especially when I compare to July they had only a 3% decline. Is that just a reflection of an extra week in the July quarter? And I have a follow up. George Kurian : The July quarter did not include any transactional revenue from the extra week. We had about 40 million as we explained in our prepared remarks from the services revenue in the July quarter due to the extra week. With regard to the October quarter, I\u2019ll just say at a high level we see the October quarter relatively the same from a macro perspective and a demand perspective that we see in the current quarter. So I would say that you\u2019re looking at the business more on a sequential basis rather than a year-on-year basis. We have continued to monitor the market. I would tell you that it\u2019s hard for me to predict the seasonality of our business. And so we\u2019re giving you an outlook on a quarterly basis. And so far what we see in the October quarter is somewhat similar to what we see in the July quarter. Mehdi Hosseini : Got it. Thank you for all the detail. Just quickly looking at the longer term, is there any way we can articulate an update on your efforts on Kubernetes? And I\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to explain at the Virtual Analyst Day, but any preview you can provide us. George Kurian : Kubernetes is a technology that grows very quickly as the new way to deploy applications and manage infrastructure. NetApp has excellent solutions for customers who are building applications using containers and Kubernetes. We have two of those solutions that work in concert; the persistent storage solution both using our Trident software and Project Astra provide customers really capable application data management capabilities, and the technology that we acquired with Spot allows customers to really optimize the cost and the effectiveness of their Kubernetes application environment. So we\u2019re really excited. We have some state-of-the-art solutions that customers are adopting and we\u2019ll tell you more about it on our Virtual Analyst Day. Mehdi Hosseini : Okay. You said you had two updates; persisting cash and\u2026? George Kurian : And the compute optimization that we acquired with Spot that is particularly helpful in Kubernetes environment. Mehdi Hosseini : Got it. Thank you. Kris Newton : All right. Thanks, Mehdi. Next question? Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Matt Cabral : Thank you. Really strong inflection in all flash that you guys saw during the quarter. Just wondering if you could dig a little bit more into what drove that and then just how sustainable you think growth in all flash is going forward, especially as the compares get much more difficult from here? George Kurian : Our all-flash array business was powered by two key things. The first is the strength of our technology, both the differentiation that we have with flash objects storage as an archival tier and hybrid cloud. And the second is the trust and confidence that the world\u2019s biggest companies are placing in NetApp. So we took several data center environments in large customers away from competitors like Hitachi and most importantly Dell. The power stored product that they have brought to market is not being well received by customers and we are displacing them in several accounts. All flash will continue to be a growing part of the total storage market. It has excellent economics and operational capabilities for customers that the amount of spending customers make on all flash in an absolute dollar sense will of course be a consideration of the macroeconomic environment and IT landscape. We will tell you more about our outlook for the storage market at Virtual Analyst Day. What I\u2019m confident about is that with the focus and operational execution that we now have in the field, we are going to be in a strong position to gain share in the all-flash array market. Matt Cabral : Got it. Thank you. Kris Newton : All right. Thank you, Matt. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I\u2019ll stick to one as well and also congratulations on the results. Just kind of back on the all-flash business, I guess the one metric that stands out to me is I think you mentioned 25% of your installed base is now in all flash. If my memory is correct, I think last quarter it was 24% and I think even a year ago it was 22%. So it seems like \u2013 help me understand why that is inflecting higher, what\u2019s going to drive a broadening or an accelerated inflection in all flash in your opinion? Maybe also in that context, how much is your installed base growing? George Kurian : Our installed base continues to grow and the fact that with strong growth rates in all-flash array, we move the penetration 1% at a time is just a dimension of the magnitude of our growing installed base. These are very, very big installed base numbers you\u2019re talking about. One flash array replaces a few disk-based systems, but I think that what we see as the face of adoption is really a representation of customer spend, right, their propensity to spend. Our view is that flash, as I just mentioned, will continue to be a priority for customers in terms of the wallet that they spend on storage. They will spend more in flash than on disk-based systems. There are more cost effective technologies that will continue to increase that percentage of the total market, but there will always be a place for disk-based hybrid flash systems as well. I think if you were to try to take an expectation, I would say that listen, over several quarters, we increased the percentage of our installed base 1% to 2% sequentially, right. And so we\u2019re focused on it. It\u2019s a large runway ahead and it\u2019s an asset that continues to provide us good opportunities to sell more value to customers. Aaron Rakers : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Aaron. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is now open. Tim Long : Thank you. I wanted to ask a little bit about the new split of product between hardware and software. Just a little more color if you could, kind of how do you demarcate that, how do you split that out? It doesn\u2019t look like the mix between the two has changed much, why is that? Is that ELA driven or something else? And what can we learn about margins between \u2013 within those two buckets within product, does that imply that given the software I\u2019m assuming is pretty high that the real hardware box type gross margins are much lower than what we\u2019re seeing for the whole group? Thank you. Mike Berry : Hi, Tim. It\u2019s Mike. So great question. So a couple of things in there to jump into. One is and you\u2019ll see in the press release, we do include in the non-GAAP section some descriptions of how we come up with that revenue. It\u2019s basically the estimated fair value allocation of those transaction prices based on what we\u2019ve done with our customers similar to how we have to allocate revenue across the board. So there\u2019s a good explanation in there, but it\u2019s basically an estimated fair value of those components. The software and hardware components will move around a little bit. You mentioned ELA. That will certainly have an influence on what goes into each quarter. If you remember how those were accounted for back when we had a good number of those. From a margin perspective, I think you can assume that it\u2019s going to be typical software margins as it relates to our business as well. So it\u2019s going to be higher than the product margin average and the hardware will be lower. But I\u2019ll also caution that really depends by product. It\u2019s going to move around a little bit. So we want to break it out to your great question so that we can also start highlighting the growth of software maintenance because those will move together. And as we continue to sell more AFF, our expectations that we would expect the component of software and the resulting software maintenance would also increase as a percentage. So hopefully that helps. Thanks for that question. Tim Long : Thank you and thanks for the disclosure. Kris Newton : Thanks, Tim. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Good afternoon. I want to ask just a couple of clarifying questions about your guidance commentary from earlier in the Q&A. First, Mike, on gross margins, I heard your comment that product margins would be flat sequentially. But if I apply the first quarter segment margins to the expected revenue mix in the second quarter, I get a total gross margin that\u2019s a little bit above 67%, so above your guidance. So is there a segment where you do see some sequential pressure on gross margin? And then the other point I guess, George, I\u2019ll ask you this on revenue. You said that we should look at the business on a sequential basis. If I adjust for the 40 million of extra revenue in the first quarter and then a bit of a currency tailwind in the second quarter, you\u2019re looking at normalized sequential growth of maybe low-single digits versus normal seasonality in an October quarter of plus 5% So just some high level comments from you George on what\u2019s driving the conservatism because that sequential is obviously off a July base that reflects the demand environment? Is there anything that you\u2019re seeing in terms of order trends during the quarter that would get you to a little bit of below seasonal revenue outlook for October? Thank you. Mike Berry : Okay. It\u2019s Mike. So I\u2019ll take the first one before George does the second one. So two things you hit on. One is it relates to the margin. When you back out the 40 million from the extra week, that lowers the percentage of gross margin dollars coming from services. So that will naturally bring down the total gross margin. The other thing is, it\u2019s not a huge mover but it\u2019s a little mover. As we do more cloud at this point, that has a small pull down impact on the services gross margin because those margins while increasing every quarter nicely are still a little below the services average. So those are the mechanics to think about when you look at Q2 total gross margin. Katy Huberty : Great. That\u2019s really helpful. And George? George Kurian : With regard to the revenue picture, I think we\u2019re just communicating that we\u2019re taking it a quarter at a time. It\u2019s a volatile environment. We\u2019ve had a good start to the year. And we\u2019re not clear whether the traditional sequential seasonality patterns apply right now. So what I\u2019ll tell you is, we\u2019re not guiding a full year. We\u2019re giving you the best outlook we see and we\u2019re being cautious, right. That\u2019s really the summary. Katy Huberty : Okay, that\u2019s understandable. Thank you very much for that color. Kris Newton : All right. Thanks, Katy. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Your line is now open. Matt Sheerin : Yes. Thank you, George, regarding the revenue guidance, I certainly appreciate that there\u2019s not a lot of visibility but could you drill down a little bit more on the current demand picture by region and customer type, enterprise, commercial, public sector, any areas of strength or weakness jump out? Thank you. George Kurian : I\u2019ll just give you a quick summary. From a segment perspective, clearly the larger enterprises where we have strong footprint was the sources of our growth. Small and medium customer is not a material part of our business. And you\u2019ve heard the commentary from several players in the IT industry, which is similar to what we see. They are challenged. We are picking up some of those small and medium customers through our cloud business where our offerings are more tailored to cash-constrained smaller companies. With regard to the geographies, essentially we had strong performance in the Americas market, driven by the strength in the largest enterprises in the Americas and our APAC region also performed well. I think the APAC region is reflective of some of those economies starting to recover from the really hard times of COVID, but we are being cautious and it\u2019s early. I think in terms of the types of transactions we saw, we did see growth in larger transactions. And what I said was, people are moving beyond business continuity to now transformational projects and investing in those. And so we benefitted from some of those. Matt Sheerin : Thank you. Kris Newton : All right. Thanks, Matt. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Your line is now open. Steven Fox : Thanks. Good afternoon. I just wanted to ask, maybe just push back a little bit on the decision still not to buy back stock. The company\u2019s \u2013 you look at last quarter and your guidance, you\u2019re doing basically an annualized $2.80 per share. You\u2019re doing more than that in EBITDA and obviously have proven ability to generate healthy cash flows during a down period. So what would trigger management\u2019s decision to maybe start buying back stock again? Thank you. Mike Berry : Hi, Steve. It\u2019s Mike. So I will take that. So as we talked about on the last call when we decided to put the share buyback on hold, it was really we needed to be able to see a lot more firmly the economic recovery, the timeline as well as the depth. And while we\u2019re starting to feel better about the year, there\u2019s still a whole bunch of uncertainty. And as George talked about, there\u2019s still a lot of economic uncertainty. So for us, we need to be more comfortable about the recovery, the timeline of the recovery and then as well making sure that we are prudently managing our cash from a domestic and international perspective. All of that would weigh into it. This is the reason why we went out and did the opportunistic debt raise is to make sure that we had cash going forward. Also as we discussed in the last call, we also want to make sure that we are looking very hard at share buyback versus growing the business through again disciplined M&A and that will also play into it as well, Steven. And then I guess wanted to note very firmly we are very committed to the dividend and we want to make sure to maintain that, and that\u2019s another reason why we pulled back on the share buybacks. Steven Fox : Great. I appreciate that perspective. Thank you. Kris Newton : All right. Thanks, Steven. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Jeriel Ong with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Jeriel Ong : Thanks for letting me ask questions and congrats on the solid results. I want to focus in on the worldwide headcount reduction of 5% which you guys just verified. In the press report that came out yesterday kind of indicated that SolidFire and HCI might be a portion of those cuts, a little bit more I guess I would say exacerbated relative to the rest of your business. Could you clarify whether that is in fact true? Is that something that was focused on? And beyond that I guess as a percentage of focusing on those cuts in general or were there certain businesses or certain portions of the employee base that were impacted more? Thanks. George Kurian : These headcount reductions are never easy to make and we take care and consideration when we decide to make those changes. Those changes were driven by the strategic alignment and focus that we have to prioritize our resources in the core storage systems and software business as well as accelerating our public cloud services business. We realigned about 5.5% of our workforce and those were in parts of the business \u2013 in all the functions of the business, but in those parts of the business that were not particularly aligned to our go-forward priorities. SolidFire, yes, I can confirm was part of the team impacted. We are narrowing our focus with the SolidFire and HCI portfolio to the high margin parts of the market as we have signaled on prior calls. Jeriel Ong : Got it. I appreciate it. Thanks. Kris Newton : Thank you. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you. I want to go back to cloud data services and look at this on an organic ARR basis. The quarter-on-quarter increase on that basis was $23 million sequentially annualized and in the prior quarter was $29 million. Given the fact that you\u2019ve got more GA status and it\u2019s more mature, why is that option rate not accelerating more to organic basis given the exposure to more cloud providers and maybe you can give us some sense of how the trajectory might change as we look forward here? George Kurian : We made some cost improvement in our cloud services portfolio in the storage platform that allowed our customers to adopt cheaper and more cost effective tiers. This is similar to what hyperscalers do periodically. And so that did affect some of our customers on our existing cloud business choosing to deploy onto a lower cost tier. So it wasn\u2019t like we didn\u2019t add more customers and add more revenue. We did move some of our capacity within the quarter to a lower cost tier. That is pretty much the majority of the gap that you\u2019re seeing on a sequential basis. Kris Newton : All right. Thanks, Wamsi. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. George Iwanyc : Thank you for taking my question. Circling back to Mike\u2019s comments on disciplined use of cash with M&A, George, can you maybe give us a sense of what areas from a technology roadmap you would look at from an M&A perspective? George Kurian : I think that we are a disciplined acquirer both for strategic, cultural and economic fit. We\u2019ve been clear that we have a broad range of interest but software and cloud centric would be the two key filters that we would look at in terms of transactions. As we\u2019ve also said, we are skeptical about doing big large transactions. I think those are far and few between. And so the majority of our investigations are more smaller transactions that you would see. George Iwanyc : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, George. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Louis Miscioscia with Daiwa. Your line is now open. Louis Miscioscia : Okay. Thank you. George, if you go back to one of your comments earlier is that small, medium business is not a material portion of your business, but looking at that you have some momentum and you\u2019re looking to gain share, you obviously must have recently done an evaluation as to why or why not to expand more aggressively into that sector which at times obviously has good rates. So can you give us an idea as you\u2019re thinking as to why that\u2019s not a good opportunity for you at all? George Kurian : It\u2019s all a matter of prioritization. We run a disciplined P&L and within that P&L we have opportunities to deploy resources. We are covering the biggest enterprises through our direct portfolio and our direct sales reps. The small, medium business we see an opportunity to address through the cloud in a very differentiated and economically scalable manner. And so you\u2019ll see us continuing to focus there. So it\u2019s a matter of prioritization of where we spend our resources and being disciplined about it. Louis Miscioscia : Okay. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Lou. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Your line is now open. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. George, I\u2019m just curious. As you think about where NetApp is going to focus in both for the company as well as what you\u2019re seeing from your customers, what do you think is going to happen to offices going forward? What\u2019s your expectation for how many people go back? How do you sort of view how this new world we\u2019re going to live in post pandemic will be? I\u2019m just kind of curious as to what you\u2019re hearing, what you\u2019re thinking? Thank you. George Kurian : Thank you for your question. We meet customers across the board. As I said, the number of executive briefings and senior executive interactions that I\u2019ve had over the last six months have been higher than at any time before because I can be on \u2013 in a single day in multiple time zones across the globe. What we see predominately is that the world at large is operating in a subdued mostly working from home model, especially in the IT buyers and the knowledge workers in our customer base. We think that that will continue. In fact, NetApp has already signaled to our employees a few weeks ago that we are going to be working from home till July of next calendar year. And so we do see this idea of our customers digitizing their businesses for both internal collaboration as well as customer interaction becoming a priority, we see the deployment of cloud together with on-premises as a needed catalogue of IT services and we have been saying that that would happen for a long period of time, and we\u2019re going to take advantage of it. Shannon Cross : Great. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, Shannon. Next question? Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Jim Suva : Thank you. And I don\u2019t know if this one question, the single question I have is best for Mike or George, but I heard earlier on the Q&A commentary of encouraging us to look at EPS on a quarter-over-quarter basis instead of year-over-year basis, and I\u2019m just kind of trying to figure out why? Is that all due to COVID? Or you\u2019re getting close to year-over-year revenues being flat or positive excluding this quarter with extra week, but on the outlook, but yet the year-over-year EPS next quarter is down pretty sizably. Maybe that\u2019s NAND pricing, maybe that\u2019s cost structure integration. Can you just kind of walk us through the logic about why you want us to focus on quarter-over-quarter instead of year-over-year for profitability? Mike Berry : Sure. Jim, thanks for the question. It\u2019s Mike. A couple of pieces there. In the prepared remarks, we wanted to make sure that when you compared the Q1 EPS number with the Q2 guide that you took into account the impact of the additional OpEx from the acquisitions as well as the 14th week, there was just a good number of moving parts there. So that\u2019s why we did focus on that in the commentary. And then yes, certainly from a year-over-year perspective as it relates to OpEx has obviously a lot to do with the revenue guide and where we are as well as us wanting to make sure that we continue to invest in the growth areas. So I didn\u2019t want to be confusing on that. Just wanted to make sure as you looked at Q1 to Q2 that you also took into account some of those large muscle movers. George Kurian : One of the other items that we had in the EPS for Q2 on a year-on-year basis was the interest expense related to the debt rate. So Mike and I are giving you sort of the big moving parts. I think as we said, that\u2019s a way for you to understand the compare between Q1 and Q2 EPS. Jim Suva : Thank you. That\u2019s greatly appreciated, gentlemen. Kris Newton : All right. Thank you, Jim. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is now open. Ananda Baruah : Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Congrats on a solid quarter and good execution. Just real quickly George and Mike, I\u2019d love to just get any context around sort of the activities coming together of the cloud data services sales team, what they\u2019re focused on and how long you think it will be until those guys get productive? Thanks. George Kurian : The cloud data services sales team is a group of experts that we\u2019ve hired with cloud backgrounds. They are focused on working closely with the hyperscalers, meaning Microsoft, Amazon and Google and selling us alongside their team as well as working with the NetApp sales team to get our installed base of customers who adopt our cloud portfolio. We\u2019re pleased. We\u2019re one quarter into the organization, but they\u2019ve clearly had an impact and we\u2019re looking forward to continuous success from them. Kris Newton : All right. Thanks, Ananda. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Victor Chiu : Hi. This is Victor Chiu in for Simon Leopold. Could you provide us with an update around your Keystone as a service offering and the progress you\u2019re seeing there, and maybe help us understand if there\u2019s a relationship between public cloud services demand and the potential impact there on consumption-based subscription services, whether there\u2019s a complementary relationship there or if that one impacts the other in a particular way? George Kurian : We\u2019ve had a good start to Keystone. Keystone is selectively available to customers in some of our geographies. We will be making it more broadly available this coming quarter. And so we\u2019ll invite you to come to our INSIGHT User Conference to hear more. We\u2019ve had several comparative wins this quarter with Keystone and Keystone as you said correctly is a good complement to our public cloud services. So a customer that has a temporary workload or wants to move an entire business process to the public cloud can choose the public cloud. And if there\u2019s a portion of that business process or there\u2019s a complementary infrastructure that they want to have deployed and run within their data center for compliance reasons or for integration to other applications, they can use Keystone and get a single experience from their data center to the public cloud. So we\u2019re pleased with the progress. You\u2019ll hear more about Keystone from us at our User Conference. Kris Newton : All right. Thanks, Victor. Next question? Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi with Lake Street. Your line is now open. Eric Martinuzzi : Yes. I wanted to go a layer deeper on the COVID-related pricing trends and how they\u2019re manifesting themselves. Is it about competitive displacements? Is it about defending the installed base? Is there a particular vertical? Just some help there please. George Kurian : Typically what happens when commodity prices go up is that we and others in the industry pass them along to customers because we typically do not hedge the commodity. We pass along the cost of SSDs through to customers when they go up or when they go down. Clearly in the COVID time that is not something we want to do. Our customers need us to be good partners and so we\u2019ve been careful about having them bear the brunt of the price increases. With regard to competitive take up and displacements, they are always a portion of our go-to-market model and we have the capabilities within our gross margin model to be aggressive in certain cases and not as aggressive in others, and we\u2019re going to continue to focus on maintaining discipline there. Eric Martinuzzi : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, Eric. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Nehal Chokshi : Yes. Congrats on some exceptionally strong results, quite amazing. A technical question from me. So Spot provides compute management in the cloud. Is this leveraging Kubernetes or is that by adding in additional software that Spot has layered on top of Kubernetes and does this effectively make it a competitor to say VMware\u2019s vRealize and their bevy of cloud relationships? George Kurian : What Spot does is both for traditional applications as well as for cloud-native applications, it identifies the pattern of behavior of that application and finds the optimized compute environment to run that application most cost effectively. So it is entirely complementary and we are very good partners, for example, with Amazon where we tell customers use the right compute tier in Amazon so that they can run more compute for the same money on the Amazon tier. We see Spot as complementary to all of our cloud providers and frankly cloud complementary to VMware. It is optimizing the run time environment for customers regardless of what version of Kubernetes they use, which class provider they run on and whether they\u2019re using a traditional application or a cloud-native application. What is also allows us to do is now because we can optimize compute and storage, we are able to address 70% of a typical customer\u2019s cloud bill and optimize a substantial amount of that cloud bill. So now we are much more strategically relevant to customers as a result of us having Spot in our portfolio. Kris Newton : All right. Thanks, Nehal. Next question? Operator : Thank you. And our final question comes from Nik Todorov with Longbow Research. Your line is now open. Nikolay Todorov : Yes. Thanks. I want to go back to the comments around strength in large enterprise and large deals. I think that has been consistent across the peers in the industry, but I just want to get your take on \u2013 you talked about the digital transformation. So are we assuming that those spending is going towards new workloads? And how sustainable do you think is that strength in large enterprise deals? Thanks. George Kurian : I think we see larger enterprises increasingly doing two things. One is exploiting data to understand and serve their customers better. That\u2019s an enduring generational trend. We also see them deploying hybrid cloud landscape so that they can serve their own employees who are working from home or extend the reach of their businesses to consumers who no longer can come into their offices. And we are extremely well positioned for both those trends. I think what we see in the large enterprise is they have the financial resources and the strategic runway to make those decisions and in fact now rather than have to necessarily wait for COVID, and that\u2019s where we saw the segment-related pattern of our business morph a little bit. Kris Newton : All right. Thanks, Nik. I\u2019ll pass it over to George for some final comments. George Kurian : Thank you for being with us this afternoon. In the face of the current macro uncertainty, we continue to make strategic moves that position us well for the long term while maintaining operational discipline. Our rich data-centric software innovation is the foundation from which we have customers thrive in a hybrid cloud world. We bring enterprise-grade data services to the cloud and the simplicity and flexibility at the cloud to the enterprise data center. No matter where a customer is on their hybrid cloud journey, NetApp can help them achieve their goals. I hope you will join us at our Virtual Analyst Day where we\u2019ll talk more about how we help customers unlock the best of cloud for their digital transformation. Stay safe and be well. Thank you.

Please also refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC and available on our website, specifically our most recent Forms 10-Q and 10-K, including in the management\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and risk factor sections and our current reports on Form 8-K. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are posted on our website. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to George. George Kurian : Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. I hope you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. Thank you for joining us on our Q2, FY '21 earnings call. NetApp delivered another strong quarter with revenue, operating margin and EPS all exceeding our guidance. I am pleased with our continued progress in an uncertain market environment. The improvements we made to sales coverage in fiscal year '20 and our tight focus on execution against our biggest opportunities continue to pay off. We saw strength in all geographies with larger customers accelerating their digital transformations with NetApp. We will continue to exploit competitive transitions, the growth of the all-flash market, and the accelerating shift to cloud to expand our leadership position. It was a busy quarter for us. We hosted an Investor Day, held our Annual Customer Conference, and introduced significant new products and services which further advanced our Data Fabric strategy. I want to thank the team for their focus on execution and customer success, especially in these challenging times. At our Investor Day, we introduced our vision for a new NetApp, a cloud-led, data-centric software company. We are building the new NetApp on a strong foundation. We are a trusted partner to the world\u2019s leading organizations who are undertaking digital transformations. We have unique strategic partnerships with the leading clouds, including deeply integrated technology and go-to-market efforts. And we have a strong business model, with a proven track record of turning market transitions to our advantage. We laid out a plan to scale our cloud business while growing and gaining share in the storage market. These foundational elements fuel growth in our high-margin software, cloud services and recurring maintenance revenue streams. This, coupled with our disciplined OpEx management, balanced approach to investing for growth, and sustained capital returns will create significant long-term shareholder value. As you can see from our Q2 results, we are successfully executing against this plan. Cloud services ARR grew to $216 million, an increase of 200% year-over-year. Our cloud services dollar-based net retention rate remains very healthy at 207%. We are pleased with the mix of new cloud services customers and growth at existing customers. We saw continued success with our Run-to-NetApp competitive takeout program, an important component of our strategy to gain new customers and win new workloads at existing customers. Our all-flash business grew 15% year-over-year to an annualized run rate of $2.5 billion. We believe we gained share again in this important market. At the end of Q2, 26% of our installed systems were all-flash, giving us opportunity for continued growth by converting our installed base, in addition to winning new customers with our industry-leading all-flash solutions. Growth in all-flash drove momentum in software product revenue, which increased 14% year-over-year, and recurring maintenance and cloud revenue, which increased 11% from last year. As I discussed last quarter, we are learning to thrive in the new normal of working remotely with each other, our customers, and our partners. We held our Insight customer conference digitally, and it was arguably our most successful one to-date. We were joined by industry luminaries from our partners and customers, all talking about how NetApp gives the world\u2019s leading organizations the freedom to put data to work in the applications that elevate their business, and our commitment to helping customers exploit the opportunity of digital transformation by building data fabrics. We had a record number of attendees, including a dramatic increase in the number of prospects and first-time attendees. While we couldn\u2019t meet face-to-face, we had thousands of customer and partner engagements. The interest in, and excitement for our Data Fabric strategy and hybrid multi-cloud solutions was unmistakable. We bring enterprise-grade data services to the cloud and the simplicity and flexibility of the cloud to the enterprise data center. We are helping customers manage their data far more effectively for digital transformation and tackle the challenges of hybrid cloud. No matter where an organization is on its hybrid cloud journey, NetApp can help it achieve its goals. In the quarter, we announced dozens of industry-leading innovations to further help customers digitally transform to thrive in a hybrid cloud world. Our software-driven portfolio allows companies to redefine how they manage data, storage, and infrastructure, whether in the cloud or on premises. We introduced serverless and storageless solutions for containers, autonomous hybrid cloud storage and data management, and elastic scale for the modern workplace. New Spot services automate cloud infrastructure for containers through the continuous analysis of how containerized applications use compute and storage to automatically adjust the infrastructure to the optimal blend, saving customers costs and radically simplifying management. Cloud Manager provides a centralized console with full visibility and control to automate management of all NetApp hybrid, multi-cloud storage and data services, such as backup, tiering, and compliance. And with our Virtual Desktop Management Service, companies can rapidly deliver comprehensive cloud-based workplace solutions with continuous optimization of resources. We also unveiled the latest version of our flagship operating system, ONTAP 9.8. ONTAP is at the heart of our approach to hybrid cloud. We enhanced the ONTAP data services to provide integrated caching across the widest range of workloads and physical data locations, enable flexible, cost effective, instantaneous failover for business-critical applications, and support object storage with S3 protocol access. Additionally, we introduced new end-to-end NVMe systems, SAN-optimized systems, and hybrid arrays to give customers a broad range of price and performance options. Finally, we made updates to NetApp Keystone Flex Subscription, providing a fast, flexible path to a cloud-enabled data center with pay-as-you-go subscription for a cloud-like experience on premises. Keystone enables our customers to consume their Data Fabric with a cloud-like experience in their data center as a managed service in addition to the public cloud. Only NetApp is able to offer customers this flexibility. Together, all of these innovations better enable enterprises to accelerate their digital transformation and adapt rapidly to unpredictable business demands. Let me share with you a couple of digital transformation stories to illustrate how we are helping customers put their data to work to elevate their businesses. A leading U.S. healthcare provider is using AI solutions from NetApp to improve patient care and experience. Our AI control plane and Kubernetes integration enabled us to displace Dell and the early success of our initial deployment has resulted in expansion to additional workloads. We are now the foundation for everything from patient check-in to AI-based radiology and pathology. At a dominant U.S.-based retailer, NetApp was selected to support the work of 500 data scientists, with plans to expand to a 1,000. These engineers are using data to create AI-driven recommendations to increase sales and improve customer satisfaction. NetApp supported their need to quickly increase their online services during the pandemic as the foundation for an AI-based service so customers could virtually try new products. It\u2019s clear that COVID-19 has reshaped the environment. Digital transformation is now a necessity, requiring speed and agility to respond to changing business conditions. Hybrid cloud is the de facto IT architecture at digitally transformed enterprises for the foreseeable future. Having an integrated, flexible data management foundation is critical to the success of digital transformation efforts. Because of this, data is growing in scale and importance and we believe that NetApp is a primary beneficiary of this trend. I am confident in both our long-term opportunity and our ability to execute against it. Our unique position in helping the world\u2019s leading organizations solve the challenge of managing their most critical data fuels our ability to win in the market. We are committed to driving disciplined growth, extending our hybrid cloud leadership, effectively expanding our business, and ensuring that we remain well-positioned for the future. Our growing margin-rich software and recurring maintenance and cloud revenues support our ability to deliver value for customers and shareholders. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Mike to walk you through the results of quarter. Mike? Mike Berry : Thank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I\u2019ll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. As George highlighted, we delivered revenue, operating margin, and EPS above the high-end of guidance. Importantly, solid execution across the company yielded Q2 billings of $1.46 billion, up 10% year-over-year. This is our second straight quarter of year-over-year billings growth. In Q2, net revenue of $1.42 billion increased 3% year-over-year, including a point of currency tailwind. Our two key strategic focus areas, our industry-leading all-flash storage business and Public Cloud Services, both outperformed our expectations in the quarter. When combined, software revenue and recurring maintenance and cloud revenue totaled $1 billion, and increased 12% year-over-year, representing 72% of total revenue. We ended Q2 with $3.7 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 5% year-over-year. Deferred revenue is the leading indicator for future recurring revenue growth. And as we highlighted at our recent Investor Day, all-flash systems carry higher maintenance dollar content relative to the rest of our portfolio. As George highlighted, our all-flash revenue of $632 million was up 15% year-over-year, positioning us for share gains for the second consecutive quarter. Only 26% of our installed systems were all-flash at the end of Q2, providing a very healthy runway for our flash business. Public Cloud Services delivered an impressive $216 million in ARR, growing 200% year-over-year and 21% sequentially, with organic ARR growth accelerating for the second straight quarter. We continue to see strong demand from our customer cohorts with Q2 dollar-based net retention rate coming in at 207%. We are on track to deliver on our commitment of $250 million to $300 million in Cloud ARR exiting fiscal '21, and remain confident in our ability to eclipse $1 billion in Cloud ARR in fiscal '25. Total product revenue of $749 million decreased approximately 3% year-over-year. In the quarter we saw good engagement from both enterprise and public sector accounts as customers continued to embrace digital transformation and hybrid cloud projects. Software product revenue of $417 million increased 14% year-over-year, driven by an increase in mix of our high-end all-flash systems. Recurring maintenance and cloud revenue of $599 million was up 11% year-over-year, constituting over 42% of total net revenue. Gross margin of 66.9% was at the high-end of guidance. Product gross margin was 53%, up 160 basis points sequentially and ahead of our expectations. The outperformance was driven by better all-flash mix. We expect product margin to remain at this level throughout the remainder of fiscal '21. Our recurring maintenance, cloud and other services business continues to be a very profitable and growing business for us, with gross margin of 82.6%. Q2 operating expenses of $657 million were in-line with our expectations. Operating margin was 20.6% and EPS was $1.05, demonstrating the strong operating leverage in our business model. Cash flow from operations was $161 million and free cash flow was $121 million, representing 9% of revenue. As a reminder, Q2 tends to be our seasonal trough for free cash flow. During the quarter we paid out $107 million in cash dividends, representing 88% of free cash flow. As you know, we paused our share repurchase program the last two quarters because of the macro backdrop. More recently, we have been encouraged by the stability in our business, broader macro trends and the recent positive results of several COVID-19 vaccine trials. As a result, we plan to reinitiate our share repurchase program during Q3, making progress towards our commitment to offset dilution from our equity plans. We ended Q2 with $3.6 billion in cash and short-term investments. Now on to guidance. We expect Q3 net revenues to range between $1.34 billion and $1.49 billion, which, at the midpoint, implies a 1% increase in revenues year-over-year and includes a point of currency tailwind. We expect consolidated gross margin to be approximately 67% and operating margin to be approximately 20% in Q3. Assumed in this guidance are operating expenses of $660 million to $670 million. The sequential increase in OpEx is being driven mainly by the annual reset in U.S. payroll taxes and healthcare benefits. We anticipate our non-GAAP tax-rate to be between 16% and 17%. And we expect earnings per share for Q3 to range between $0.94 and $1.02 per share. Assumed in this guidance is interest expense of $15 million to $20 million. In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for the hard work and commitment in delivering another great quarter. We remain well-positioned to take advantage of the market transitions George highlighted and capitalize on the big opportunity ahead. I\u2019ll now hand the call back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris? Kris Newton : Thanks Mike. We\u2019ll now open the call for Q&A. Please be respectful of your peers and limit yourself to just one question so we can get to as many people as possible. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is now open. Tim Long : Thank you. I just wanted a little bit more color on the cloud services business. Could you just give us a little insight into how new customers contributed to that line? And also maybe, how much are we seeing that are kind of cloud only deployments not also carrying some enterprise business with you? And then just another part of that is that, is there anything we should look to over the next few quarters for that line as far as new products or new outlets to help accelerate that growth line even further? Thank you. George Kurian : We continued to be very pleased by many dimensions of our cloud business growth. I think we've got expansion in regions, expansion in certifications, for example, FedRAMP certifications, that allow us to serve new industries, new customer segments, and of course, the breadth of cloud service offerings. With both Microsoft and Google, we now serve a huge range of applications, everything from databases to virtualized environments, to Windows environments, and so on. And so there's a very large opportunity in front of us. In terms of our capture, we are capturing a broad range of customers, digital natives, who are born in the cloud companies that don't really have a data center, because all of their IT environments run on the cloud. We are capturing a substantial number of net new customers who have got a data center business, but not with NetApp, with our competitors, and of course, NetApp customers who are expanding their IT footprints as they deploy cloud-based environments with us. So we are pleased across all the dimensions of our cloud business. In terms of the innovation portfolio, we are innovating at Cloud speed, and you'll see continued updates from all of our teams over the next few quarters. Kris Newton : Thanks, Tim. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Rod Hall : Yes, thank you for the question. I wanted to drill into the product revenue that particularly the software product revenue, which grew really well in the quarter. I know, Mike, you said in your prepared remarks that that was driven by high-end AFA. So I wanted to come back to comments you made George earlier in the quarter when we talked to you about the competitive environment. And just ask whether you think you're taking share there. What's driving that revenue growth? I also would love it if you guys could comment on whether there's any ELAs in that line. I just note that Dell storage revenue was down 7% here and you guys are down less so curious about your thinking on share and competitive dynamics. George Kurian : Listen, if you look at the results of all of our major competitors, [indiscernible], Dell, and HP, there's no question we have taken share. I think our product portfolio is the best in the market. In the all-flash array category, the richness of our software capabilities, the hybrid cloud integration, all has driven advantage in the all-flash arrays segment. The all-flash array mix was up in the quarter. And within the all-flash configurations, the high-end products which carry a substantial amount of software and maintenance, which leads to the growth in deferred revenue as a part of our business model. So we're really pleased. I think with regard to our sort of outlook, we continue to be really bullish about our portfolio. As I said, we got the best products in the market, uniquely positioned to give customers a hybrid cloud roadmap. And I feel really, really good about our position there. With regard to ELAs I'll have Mike comment. Mike Berry : Thanks, George. Hey, Rod. It's Mike. Thanks for the question. So as George mentioned, as we said in our prepared remarks, the outperformance in product revenue and product margin, it was driven by the high-end flash system sales. And as we noted, we expect product margins to remain right around that 53% for the rest of the year. And as we talked about, on the last two earnings calls, we're not guiding any ELAs going forward because they are such a small portion of our business, which is why we're not breaking those out anymore, any longer going forward. Rod Hall : Okay, great. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, Rod. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman with Cowen. Your line is now open. Karl you may be on mute. Karl Ackerman : Yep. Sorry about that. Is there a way to think about how much of the sequential or year-over-year growth you saw in all-flash arrays was due to the implementation of your run to NetApp initiative versus upgrading your installed base? I asked because the 15% year-over-year growth rate is significant relative to peers in the context of your 9% CAGR you spoke about during your Analyst Day. And so I guess as we think about the sustainability of your growth rate for all-flash arrays, have you changed the way you incentivize your sales force for these run to NetApp initiatives or for upgrading your installed base all-flash? Thank you. George Kurian : I just want to begin, thanks for the question. I want to begin by saying that the 9% CAGR we referred to at the Investor Day was really market growth rates of all-flash arrays. We have continued to outperform the market. And as you noted correctly, we feel very confident we are taking share in the market. The products that we offer has leadership and performance efficiency, hybrid cloud connectivity, and a scale out architecture that our competitors cannot match. The run to NetApp campaign, which is a competitive migration program had another very strong quarter in Q2. And as we noted, we are focused on attacking the competitive product transitions in some of our competitors and taking share. And we feel very, very good about the progress to-date. If you look at the installed base, we're at 26% penetration of the installed base, which means that we still have a very large amount of room to continue to expand the flash footprint in our installed base. So net-net, strong quarter. We feel excellent about our product portfolio. We think we can continue to take share, as we said at the Analyst Day, and we're demonstrating that and our competitors have real challenges in executing their product transitions that we are taking advantage of. Kris Newton : All right. Thanks, Karl. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Your line is now open. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes, thanks for all the detail around all-flash array. But actually, I have one follow-up trying to dig in. Is there any way you can give us qualitatively or quantitatively the mix of software in AFA in October quarter? And how does it compare on a year-over-year and a Q-over-Q basis so we can better understand the trends there and what enables you to gain market share? Mike Berry : Hey, Mehdi, it's Mike. So thanks for the question. If you take a look at our non-GAAP supplemental disclosures, you'll see that on a quarter-over-quarter basis and year-over-year, the software portion of product revenue grew substantially. So on a year-over-year basis, it was up 14%. Commensurately hardware was down 18%, a lot of that was driven by the growth in all-flash. In addition, based on the booking under billings number of 10% and AFA growing faster than that, you can see that the other portions of our portfolio shrunk year-over-year. So again, that's going to put a lot more in software and as George mentioned, in support as well, because you also see billings growth of 10%, revenue growth of 3%. And a lot of that everything that doesn't go to revenue goes to the balance sheet, which is great for our future support revenue. So hopefully that helps in your question. George Kurian : For the color on, why are we taking share in the all-flash business, I think there are two things there. One is we are more focused and executing better as we signalled, where we have really put emphasis on winning with the strongest parts of our portfolio against the biggest opportunities. And the second, I think, is COVID, I think has really accelerated in our customers. They're thinking about hybrid cloud deployments. And we have clear leadership in helping our customers build hybrid cloud architectures. I think those are the two elements in addition to having a really strong product portfolio that gives us the ability to take share. Mehdi Hosseini : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, Mehdi. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is now open. Amit Daryanani : Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a nice quarter. I guess my questions on all-flash array as well, and maybe two parts it but, all-flash growth at 15% is fairly impressive. I'd love to understand the sustainability of this double digit growth as we go forward. And then assuming this mix keeps shifting towards more AFA, I'm somewhat surprised by the commentary on product gross margins will remain flat for the rest of the year, because I would imagine all-flash array have a better gross margin structure with the worse the rest of the product.  So just touch on the sustainability of this growth, we're seeing all-flash array. And then why aren't we seeing a better flow through on product gross margin given mix getting better? Thanks. George Kurian : I'll talk about the first part of your question Amit, thank you. And then I'll give it to Mike to talk about the product gross margin. With regard to the all-flash array business, we see, as we said that Investor Day, this being a multiyear transition in the storage market. We see that because we are still in the early innings of the technology curve in the all-flash array market. And we think that there are more technologies coming online over the next 18 to 24 months that will move more and more of the disk-based market to the all-flash market. We don't think that all of the disk-based market moves to all-flash. But as we said, a substantial percentage of the total storage market, meaning let's say 70% to 80% will be an all-flash array portfolio. We are in the early stages. We think that as we said in our installed base as an example, we are at 26% after many, many years of driving all-flash, and there's a long way to go, just to upgrade our entire installed base to all-flash. With regard to the ability to continue to drive share games, it's about focus, it's about innovation, and it's about meeting customer expectations. We think we're doing a good job, and we're going to continue to keep doing that. With that, let me hand it to Mike to talk about gross margins. Mike Berry : Thanks, George. Amit thanks for the question. So, a couple pieces on this that I would focus on. As we talked about earlier today and in the prepared remarks, the majority of the outperformance in gross margin came from the high-end of our all-flash that was something that we had not expected going into the quarter.  Our guidance for the rest of the year assumes that that normalizes a little bit still growth in all-flash. But as you get into the high-end, you get even a little bit better margins because of the higher percentage of software. So we're forecasting now to come back and normalize a little bit still growth in all-flash, just not so much of the high-end mix. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, Amit. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, guys. This is Michael on behalf of Aaron. Thanks for taking the question. I just have a quick one. Last quarter, I think you disclosed $44 million of ARR attributed to your recent acquisitions of CloudJumper, Spot and Talon. Could you give us an idea of what that was this quarter? Mike Berry : Hey, Michael, it's Mike Berry. Yes, so we are not going to disclose the ARR from the acquisitions going forward. I will tell you that they have continued to grow. We did disclose that the growth rate of the organic ARR accelerated as well during the quarter. So still all good on the acquisitions. But going forward, we're not going to break those out separately. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Okay. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Michael. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is now open. Ananda Baruah : Hi, good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on solid execution. And thanks for taking the question. Yes, this one just might be for both of you guys. Please give us a sense of how you guys reviewing sort of spending recovery right now, really you think sort of the industry is in that? And is there any way to anecdotally give us a sense of how much of the strength and performance has been from industry recovery sort of reopening the sales force initiatives. George, some of what you talked about, which is just the strength of the portfolio is folks looking at stand up incremental hybrid, just trying to get a sense of all of that, and really, to get a sense of how much more there may be to go from a structural sense for you guys, since you have so many initiatives going on right now. Thanks a lot. George Kurian : I think first of all, we are in an extraordinary time. And, I want to applaud our customers, our teams for being able to continue to execute in such a difficult time. I will tell you that we have had a great first-half and that is primarily because of our focus and execution. I think the macro has been choppy, I think it's not going to deteriorate further, it's stabilized. But if you look at the results of our business against those of our competitors, there's no question we took share and we out executed them in a relatively tough market. I think within the customer base, I want to highlight three things. First, enterprise customers are beginning to move their businesses forward, because they realize that they have to transform to meet the moment and to thrive in the moment. And so the transformational projects, especially in the larger customers, are moving forward. Our business mix is key is tilted towards that and we are benefiting from that. The second I think is that, listen, we're pleased with the vaccines and the news about the vaccines. We think that the economy has mostly stabilized and it'll go forward. It should get better from here. But we are in the midst of a nationwide lockdown. We have lockdowns in many other parts of the world. We are in for a tough few months here between November and January. And so we're being prudent about our outlook for the next few months. We think we are extremely well-positioned for when the market turns as it will over time. Mike, you want to add any comment? Mike Berry : No, nothing to add. Ananda Baruah : Well I was going to ask any update on how the impact of sales force has been able to make so far. George Kurian : We said that we were adding capacity about 200 heads, we had provided an update that we have met our expectations of that hiring one quarter ahead of time in Q4, of fiscal year '20. Those heads are on board, they are driving really good results. It takes about four quarters for a wreck to be fully productive. So as we said, this fiscal year is the payoff for that investment. We're pleased with the progress and we're going to keep our head down and keep executing. Ananda Baruah : Great, thanks. Thanks, guys. Kris Newton : All right. Thanks, Ananda. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Your line is now open. Matt Sheerin : Yes, thank you. In your commentary, you highlighted the Keystone as a service model. Can you provide more color on the kind of traction you're seeing there from customers, the kind of customer mix on growth projections? And given that most of your competitors are offering similar as a service programs, how is the NetApp program differentiated? Thank you. George Kurian : I think first of all, thanks for the question. Keystone is an element of how we offer customers the ability to have an outcome as a service. There are financing vehicles that we and other people offer, which are really procurement vehicles, we've always had them they are a part of our selling motion. And you know what, I think they are going to continue to be a part of emotion go forward. With regard to what we do with Keystone is offer it to customers who don't want to deploy and manage infrastructure, but just want to have an outcome as a service. We have many ways to fulfil that type of demand from customers. Clearly, our cloud solutions are the first and most effective way to meet those expectations. Because you can instantly spin up environments, and instantly spin them down. And you got them deployed on all of the world's leading public clouds with the best operating system in the world. The second is Keystone services from NetApp and similarly, Keystone like services from our wide range of service provider and managed service partners. So we have a good number of ways to meet that customer demand. I'm excited at the pipeline of Keystone and the wins we're having. They are enterprise customers. A lot of them are competitive footprints, take outs, and they are net new environments. So we're not in the business of going after brownfields. We're looking at net new environments, new cloud and customer deployment. So certainly you'll hear more about that from us over the next few quarters. Thanks. Matt Sheerin : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Matt. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. George Iwanyc : Thank you for taking my question. George, following up on your comments regarding the current environment, can you maybe give us a sense for the puts and takes if there is a continued surge, maybe here in the U.S. and then globally, what you've learned over the last quarter from a COVID perspective? George Kurian : I think we do believe that the next few months, as I said earlier, are going to be a challenging set of months, right. I think you see that in the news every day. And what we are seeing is that companies have begun to move towards the new normal, right, they've optimized their operating models to deal with a hybrid or remote working model. They realized that they have to get moving on projects that were historically stalled, and so on. So we do think that they are better equipped to deal with the surge if there is one. The human challenge and the cost of doing so is high, right. And so we're being appropriately careful in our outlook for the next few months. We think that as we said, for the most part, I think, we see every sign that things have stabilized, they're not back to the new normal. There'll be improvements over time to get there. But I think sort of the further downward trajectory mostly stabilized. Kris Newton : Thank you, George. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Your line is now open. Steven Fox : Thanks. Good afternoon. George, just one more on the market share gains. You highlighted how all-flash arrays was sort of a stimulus for not just the upside in the quarter, but also driving more software sales. Can you just sort of talk about why you saw sort of the higher end revenues and how much you're able to sort of shape that going forward, as opposed to just benefiting from certain workloads? Thank you. George Kurian : I think first of all-flash arrays have a higher mix of software, the software, in the all-flash array is what makes it so much more efficient, in terms of workload consolidation, infrastructure, management, automation, and so on. And our all-flash arrays certainly carry a very rich software portfolio. With regard to the mix, it really depends on the customer type and the customer use case. If there are deep consolidation environments, they generally tend to have a larger system, so that they can deploy fewer systems to consolidate more environments. If it is more of a project based mix, they typically have a more midrange type of model that they deploy. So it's really depend around customers. I think we feel very good about our competitive position across all the elements, midrange, high end, entry. And we're going to stay focused on selling the right solution to customers. I would also say what's unique about NetApp is we also have a really good hybrid flash portfolio that allows us to sell the right product for the right use case and customers. Steven Fox : That's very helpful. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Steve. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. Matt Cabral : Yes, thank you. Looks like you guys had a good quarter in U.S. public. Why don't you just talk a little bit more about what drove that strength and how sustainable you think tailwinds are in that segment going forward? George Kurian : I want to thank our U.S. public sector team and our public sector leader. It was good execution in the public sector business. As we have said on prior calls, we have continued to broaden the range of our public sector business both to be more involved in program type spending that is distributed over the course of a year rather than at the typical public sector year-end in the federal agencies, as well as to grow our state, local and higher education business, which for us is a smaller percentage of our total business than a typical company our size. And I think we have done well across all those dimensions. We had some really good wins and slides. We have a broad book of business in the public sector, and I feel good about where we are. We have a new administration coming in. We will have to wait to see what the administrations priorities are. But I'm confident that our team will adjust and adapt appropriately. And so we will take it a good quarter at a time and we are pleased with the progress. Matt Cabral : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Matt. Next question. Our next question comes from Louis Miscioscia with Daiwa. Your line is now open. Louis Miscioscia : Okay, thank you. On a similar note, it looks like Europe was seasonally strong, maybe even a little bit stronger than U.S. commercial. So just any reason why in comparison to last year I know seasonality is changing a lot these days, from comparison to last year. U.S. Commercial was a little bit stronger. But you had a strong Europe this year. George Kurian : If you just look at the first half of this year, the U.S. business has done really well. I'm pleased with the progress. I think, when I look at puts and takes between Q1 and Q2, deals move around between the quarters. So I wouldn't draw any unusual conclusion. I feel like we did see a much stronger book of business in Q2 across all the geographies. So I feel really good as we talked about in my prepared remarks. The breadth of the business is encouraging and we're going to continue stay focused and execute. Louis Miscioscia : Okay. Good luck in the second-half. George Kurian : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks Louis. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Your line is now open. Jim Suva : Thank you very much. And George, congratulations to you and your team. If my memory is correct, I think your sales force was all in place about a quarter ahead of time, which means by now they're kind of fully on boarded, got their healthcare benefits, don't shadowing and are out there. And if so, it seems like the second-half of your fiscal year should even be stronger than this first-half. Plus, we're kind of getting hopefully through Coronavirus, with some vaccines and other countries opening up. Is that a logical way to think of things that the second-half of this year could even be stronger, or there are some things that kind of we should kind of pause or be aware of that just seems like everything's really striking and sync, and quite well at net out? So I just want don't want to get too far ahead of myself. But it seems like second-half should even be stronger than first-half. George Kurian : Jim, thank you for your question and for the comments. Listen, you're correct about the sales force hiring having been completed a quarter ahead of time in Q4 of fiscal year '20. And as we said, we are enabling them, and it takes about four quarters to get a rep fully up to speed. We had a great first-half, we delivered our key strategic initiatives, we're growing all-flash revenue, taking share, continue to scale our cloud franchise. As I've said before, we love our market position. We have competitive transitions, the pipeline is healthy. The cloud platform is clearly expanding with the big hyper scalars. And as I said, we see the macro stabilizing the vaccine trials should give us all incremental confidence. We're trying to balance the sobering reality of what the next few months looks like for businesses for families, the lockdown not only in the U.S., but in many, many parts of the world. And so we're trying to balance the reality with the fact that our customer engagement in even in Q3 and compared with continue to be very constructive. So we're trying to do is take a prudent view of what the near-term looks like, given the uncertainty. But we feel very, very good about our position here year-to-date. Mike, you want to add anything? Mike Berry : So I'd just add a couple of things. Jim, thanks for the question. As George talked about, we do feel good about the business. That is one of the reasons why we're reinstituting our share buyback as we look forward. As we do expect, it's still going to be a couple of months of difficult times, unfortunately for all of us. The other thing to keep in mind too and some of the great questions earlier is when we give revenue guidance, keep in mind as well Jim based on the changing mix of the business, that we do expect billings growth to continue to be ahead a revenue growth as we do more AFA in cloud. So also, just as you look at the second-half, keep that in mind as well, please. Jim Suva : Thank you so much, and congratulations. Kris Newton : Thanks, Jim. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Nick Todorov with Longbow. Your line is now open. Nick Todorov : Yes, thanks. Congrats on a great quarter guys. George and Mike, I think you guys are seeing nice progress on the Cloud Data Services businesses accelerating. I think you're probably tracking towards the high-end of your fiscal year '21 guidance. You talked about some of the factors, but I guess can you give us some update whether you the whitelisting that was a hindrance at [Indiscernible] file is still in place? And maybe can you give us some color on what percentage of the net new NetApp CDS customers have an existing on-prem environment versus what percent of those are born in the cloud? George Kurian : With regard to the progress of the cloud data services business, we feel really good. I think the last couple of quarters have really demonstrated the progress in our business, both in our organic business which continues to accelerate, and the inorganic portfolio, especially Spot. We have a strong value proposition for customers, helping them optimize both compute and storage in the cloud for both traditional workloads, as well as cloud native workloads, containerized, workloads, serverless computing, and so on. So really good, broad position in the market. With regard to our business mix, as I said, we are getting a broad range of customers both cloud native customers who are born in the cloud companies, as well as enterprises that did not buy from NetApp that have data center footprints with our competitors. I think all of these are vehicles for us to go displace over time or expand our share of wallet app customers over time. Mike you want to add any comments? Mike Berry : No, nothing to add. George Kurian : Maybe I can just hit on your comment about whitelisting. Listen, whitelisting is a capability that's put in place, it requires customers to essentially register before they deploy a workload on our service. And given the kinds of workloads that we deploy on the public cloud platforms, high performance computing, mission critical run the business workloads, like SAP, and mission critical database environments, like Oracle RAC, we are going to continue to monitor. We're making progress towards the removal of whitelisting, but we're going to keep it in place for as long as we need to make sure that our customers have less flawless customer experience. Nick Todorov : Thanks. Kris Newton : Thank you, Nick. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Eric Martinuzzi with Lake Street. Your line is now open. Eric Martinuzzi : Yes, I wanted to better understand the sequential revenue in the hardware maintenance and pro services. So historically, I would expect that to kind of inch up Q1 to Q2. Now, I know it's composed of about 80% hardware maintenance, and about 20% Pro services. What can you tell me about that Q1 to Q2 and then your expectation for Q3? Mike Berry : Yes. Hey, Eric, it's Mike. Keep in mind that Q1 had the extra week in it. So when you look quarter-on-quarter, that was about $40 million of incremental revenue that we recorded simply because of the extra week coming off the balance sheet, it was about half and half between software and hardware pretty close. So you need to when you look quarter-on-quarter back out that increase, or that amount in Q1, when you do that you actually see a nice growth still sequentially in hardware maintenance. Eric Martinuzzi : Okay. And the expectation for Q3 that continues. Mike Berry : As long as -- that depends entirely on the conversation we just had earlier, Eric, in terms of the mix. If the mix holds consistent with what we saw in Q2, then there would be really no reason to believe it would be different. Keep in mind too that $3.7 billion of deferred revenue, like most software technology companies, 80% to 90% of our maintenance revenue comes off their balance sheet, so you don't get a lot of impact in the quarter outside of FX. Eric Martinuzzi : Got it. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, Eric. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is now open. Victor Chiu : Hi, guys, this is Victor Chiu in for Simon Leopold. A number of conversations we've had suggested that Dell's midrange power store refresh has fallen somewhat short of markets expectations. Is this consistent with what you've observed? And is this significant piece of the share shift that's contributing to NetApp's results? George Kurian : I think a couple of things there. First of all, we continue to believe that the midrange modular architecture, like NetApp has, is the sweet spot in price performance across the entire landscape. There are customers that will buy a high-end architecture like a power max or our high-end systems, but the vast majority of the customer workloads are going to transition to a midrange clustered system. And I think as not only we have observed, but many of our competitors have also observed, the mid-range from Dell has not met expectations. It is an incomplete product. It is hard to build a new midrange system. And so it's going to be some time before they can mature that and make that a real system. And you bet we intend to take share from them during that transition. We have seen the execution and the impact of that in our run to NetApp campaign. And we're going to pour it on. Victor Chiu : Great. That's very helpful. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Victor. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital. Your line is now open. Nehal Chokshi : Yes, thanks. Good quarter by the way. I wanted to pile on a question here for the answer to George, where you talked about confidence that shift to all-flash array was going to continue due to flash innovations coming down in the next 18 to 24 months. Could you detail what are those flash innovations? And then another question real quickly is that what are the pieces of add-on software that tends to attach more to all-flash array and hybrid arrays? George Kurian : With regard to the innovations in the all-flash array market, there are more cost effective technologies coming in the all-flash arrays segment, like quad level cell technology that continues to erode the value proposition of performance drives, 10k drives that transitions underway. We think there will be more and more of that market that will transition to all-flash arrays. The second is with regard to the software contribution, what we do with software in the all-flash arrays is to make them much more efficient in terms of data reduction, data compression and so on. And the second is to allow them to protect their data in more and more ways given that you have a ton of data sitting on an all-flash system. So the economics of all-flash are benefited by using software based data management. And those configurations as a result, have a higher percentage of their value in software, then in a disk-based system. Nehal Chokshi : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Nehal. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Your line is now open. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. Just a question on component costs. I'm curious is what you're seeing HP and it's not necessarily at exact overlap, obviously, but mentioned that some of their backlog was filled with higher cost components as they're seeing some price increases. Is that something you're looking at? And how do you feel about the opportunity to pass through, some of that component cost increases that we're expecting as you go into 2021 and beyond? Thank you. Mike Berry : Hey, Shannon, it's Mike. What we saw in Q2 is we did see higher component costs, specifically related to SSDs. We do expect in the second-half of our fiscal year to see some of that pricing pressure ease. So we do expect some lower pricing. And we do expect that likely will continue into '22. Now a lot of that depends on the economy. As you know, a lot of that of SSDs are also consumed by some consumer products, mobile phones, we're seeing a lot of that demand drop as we go into the second-half of our fiscal year. We expect that to go into '22. We'll see how the economy rebounds though. But overall, we do expect component costs to be a little bit of a help in the second-half and then hopefully going into '22. But we'll have to see all the supply and demand comes out especially on SSDs. Shannon Cross : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Shannon. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Congrats on the quarter. George, you gave a few examples of customer adoption of AI use cases. Do you have a sense for what percent of new orders or new deals tie to AI workloads? And is this a driver of the strength in high-end all-flash array demand in the quarter? Thanks. George Kurian : Thank you, Katie. We are focused in our game plan on AI in solutions that are tied to specific industries. I think in healthcare, we are seeing a good adoption of AI where the stretched employees whether they are radiologists or whether they are patient administration personnel are being helped by AI techniques. And we also are focused in manufacturing and in select parts of financial services on the use of AI. So we're seeing good returns from that. I think with regard to why we are succeeding with AI techniques and AI solutions is because video and audio analysis, image analysis for example is now a mature and effective AI technique, and image and video and audio files they sit on NetApp file storage, and so we're an excellent platform for AI for them. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Katie. Next question. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Chung with JP Morgan. Your line is now open. Paul Chung : Hi, guys, thanks for taking my questions. So just a quick one on free cash flow. So are we going to see large harvesting of working cap as we typically see in the second-half of the fiscal year? I did notice, less investments in working cap in the first-half relative to kind of past year. So maybe not as large the kind of seasonal swing in the second-half just your thoughts there. Mike Berry : Hey, Paul, it's Mike. Thanks for the cash flow question. Always fun to get that. It's a question. Hey, so keep in mind last year, two big movers on cash flow to note that any aside in the numbers in Q2 of last year, that the tax payments were pulled forward really into Q2. We paid about $100 million more in taxes last year in Q2 than this year. I note that because we will still pay those, they'll just fall into the second-half. The other part is as it relates to working capital, as you saw in the cash flow statement, we did do better in Q2 and collections. You saw that in the cash generated by deferred revenue and ARR. So as long as billings continue at the level that we're at, I would expect to see that in the second-half as well. But as you think about second-half, please keep in mind those tax payments, that'll be the biggest swing factor on working capital. Paul Chung : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Paul. Next question. Operator : Our last question comes from Ruplu Bhattacharya with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Wamsi Mohan : Yes, thank you. It's Wamsi at BofA. Congrats on the strong quarter guys. George, it sounded like you're expecting some demand elasticity given the pricing advantages of QLC. Just curious, what gives you the confidence given that the last NAND pricing downturn did not really show that elasticity and NetApp\u2019s revenues actually declined. So what would it be that's different in this cycle that you see? Thank you. George Kurian : We are actually seeing that QLC first of all, is not in the market yet it will be over time. I think that what we are seeing is QLC makes the advantage of an all-flash array relative to a 10k performance drive even better. So today, there are customers buying all-flash arrays, when they are roughly three times the cost of a hard drive. With QLC, that number gets a lot closer to one and a half to two times. And so the advantage will be even more material. I think we got to compete to win share in the all-flash array transition that that drives, plain and simple. I don't think that it's going to not require us to execute. We think that more workloads will come on to all-flash, and to the extent that we executed that all-flash transition, it gives us a chance to pick up share. Kris Newton : All right. Well, thanks, Wamsi. I'll now pass it back to George for final comments. George Kurian : Thanks, Kris. Thanks to everyone. In summary, we delivered another strong quarter, successfully executing against our plan to scale our cloud business while growing in the storage market. We are a primary beneficiary of the increasing importance of data and are uniquely positioned to help customers in hybrid cloud environments and with their digital transformations. I am confident in our ability to drive long-term growth, extend our hybrid cloud leadership and deliver value for our customers, partners and shareholders. Thank you to all of you. I hope you all stay safe and so do your loved ones and families. Have a wonderful holiday season. See you soon. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference to your host, Ms. Kris Newton. Ma'am, you may begin. Kris Newton : Thank you for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Mike Berry. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com.  During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects such as our guidance for the fourth quarter fiscal year 2021, our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability and shareholder return and our ability to continue overall growth, gain market share and scale our cloud business, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially for a variety of reasons, including macroeconomic and market conditions, such as the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the IT capital spending environment as well as our ability to gain share in the storage market, scale our cloud business and generate greater cash flow.  Please also refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC and available on our website, specifically our most recent Forms 10-Q and 10-K, including in the management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and risk factors sections and our current reports on Form 8-K.  During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are posted on our website. I'll now turn the call over to George. George Kurian : Thanks, Kris, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. I hope that you and your loved ones have stayed safe and healthy since the last time we spoke. I'm pleased to report that we delivered another strong quarter with our third consecutive quarter of revenue and billings growth despite the challenging environment. In the third quarter, our team delivered revenues at the top of our guidance range and operating margin and EPS above the high end of our expectations. Our performance in Q3 was broad-based, with notable strength in Americas enterprise. The incremental sales capacity we added in FY '20 continues to pay off. Additionally, our Run to NetApp competitive takeout program is delivering continued success as we gain share and displace competitors' installed bases. Most importantly, this quarter, we once again demonstrated our ability to grow in both of our key markets : cloud and all-flash arrays. As we have said many times, cloud is additive to our business, that what we do in the cloud helps expand our on-premises business and that our enterprise hardened software and experience provide a solid foundation for our work in the cloud. Cloud services ARR grew to $237 million, an increase of 186% year-over-year. We saw good momentum across the portfolio, with Azure NetApp Files and Spot being the standout services, both delivering significant growth. We continue to expand with existing customers while adding new enterprise and cloud-native customers. Our cloud services dollar-based net retention rate is a healthy 227%.  Our cloud partners are asking us to expand regional deployments, broaden workload certifications and invest in go-to-market activities to support this rapidly growing business. We had a significant presence at both AWS re :Invent and at Google Sales kickoff meeting. This engagement helps us stay top of mind with their sellers and reach customers with our cloud value proposition.  We are benefiting as customers move more Tier 1 workloads such as SAP to the cloud. Our cloud volume service delivers the performance and availability required by mission-critical applications. To address the substantial cloud opportunity ahead, we are pulling forward investments with our public cloud partners, adding dedicated sales capacity and expanding our presence in additional regions. As we look ahead, we have a strong pipeline to support our Q4 target. Our cloud partner engagement and expanding product road map reinforce our confidence in our long-term goal of achieving $1 billion in cloud ARR in fiscal year '25.  Our all-flash business grew 11% year-over-year to an annualized net revenue run rate of $2.6 billion. For the third consecutive quarter, we believe we outpaced the market, gaining share from competitors and converting our installed base from hybrid arrays to all-flash. At the end of Q3, 27% of installed systems were all-flash, giving us plenty of headroom for continued growth. Our all-flash arrays received accolades from industry analysts and customers alike. They integrate cloud connectivity with the speed and efficiency of flash to deliver a smart, powerful and trusted solution for the most demanding enterprise workloads.  In Q3, we expanded the breadth of our flash offerings with the introduction of the FAS500f, our first all-flash array leveraging QLC technology. The FAS500f is a highly scalable solution for deployments that support huge volumes of unstructured data such as medical imaging, electronic design automation and computer-aided design and manufacturing.  Our cloud services and flash systems are built on the same primary software foundation, ONTAP. This shared R&D foundation gives us significant leverage in our R&D investment. We are able to innovate and test at cloud speed while bringing new functionality to the enterprise data center at a pace IT can absorb. This shared innovation also benefits customers, giving them a similar operating environment and consistent data management tools on-premises and in the cloud. It also enables them to move their data seamlessly to the right location at the right price at the right time.  As I noted on our last call, NetApp is helping customers accelerate their digital transformations and put their data to work to elevate their businesses. Digital transformation is now a necessity, requiring speed and agility to respond to changing business conditions. Hybrid cloud is the de facto IT architecture at digitally transformed enterprises for the foreseeable future.  Having an integrated flexible data management foundation is critical to the success of digital transformation efforts. Because of this, data is growing in scale and importance. We believe that NetApp is a primary beneficiary of this trend. We are uniquely positioned to address customers' requirements for workloads that move to the cloud as well as those that maintain and modernize on premises.  Let me share a few wins from the third quarter to illustrate why customers choose NetApp to manage their data in the hybrid cloud. A global pharmaceutical manufacturer needed to overcome the compliance challenges of regulatory mandates while minimizing security risks in moving to the public cloud. They selected NetApp all-flash FAS to underpin their AI-driven health care because of our cloud connectivity and the ability to achieve petabyte scale, along with our unique data protection and data management capabilities.  At a leading global clinical trial laboratory, NetApp displaced Dell to host workloads for the company's AI labs. We won because of our performance, cloud connectivity and data management and security capabilities. The ability to leverage NetApp cloud services when necessary was critical to the customer's decision.  Calendar 2020 was a difficult year for all of us and I'm glad to have it behind us. I want to express my gratitude to the NetApp team for quickly coming together to deliver solid results by helping our customers thrive while working remotely. We see reasons for optimism for calendar 2021 with expanding vaccine availability and improving public health conditions. However, uncertainty about the new normal as well as the tax and regulatory environments remain. In uncertain markets, data is even more critical as organizations look to drive competitive advantage, and we are confident in our strategy and the strength of our business going forward.  Cloud and All Flash FAS fuel the momentum in our high margin software, cloud services and recurring maintenance revenue streams. This growth, coupled with our disciplined OpEx management, balanced approach to investing in the business and sustained capital returns will create significant long-term shareholder value.  The new NetApp is a cloud-led software company and it's built on a solid foundation. We are a trusted partner to the world's leading organizations who are undertaking digital transformations. We have unique strategic partnerships with the world's leading clouds, including deeply integrated technology and go-to-market efforts. And we have a strong business model with a proven track record of turning market transitions to our advantage. As the recovery gradually unfolds, we believe we will be in an even stronger position as customers continue to turn to NetApp to help them solve the challenge of managing data in the hybrid cloud. I'll now turn it over to Mike for more details on our results. Mike? Michael Berry : Thank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. We delivered another solid quarter, with revenue at the high end of our guide and operating margin and EPS above expectations. Importantly, solid execution yielded Q3 billings of $1.6 billion, up 6% year-over-year. This is our third straight quarter of year-over-year billings growth. In Q3, net revenue of $1.47 billion increased 5% year-over-year, including 2 points of currency tailwind.  We believe our 2 key strategic focus areas, our industry-leading all-flash storage business and public cloud services, both continued to outperform the market. When combined, software revenue, recurring maintenance and cloud revenue totaled $1.1 billion and increased 13% year-over-year, representing 72% of total revenue. We ended Q3 with $3.8 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 7% year-over-year. Deferred revenue continues to be a leading indicator for future recurring revenue growth.  As we highlighted at our Investor Day, all-flash systems carry higher software and maintenance dollar content relative to the rest of our portfolio. As George highlighted, our all-flash revenue of $652 million was up 11% year-over-year, positioning us for share gains for the third consecutive quarter. Only 27% of our installed systems were all-flash at the end of Q3, providing a very healthy runway for our flash business.  Public cloud services delivered a solid $237 million in ARR, growing 186% year-over-year and 10% sequentially. We continue to see strong demand from our customer cohorts with Q3 dollar-based net retention rate coming in at 227%. Given the strong sales pipeline heading into Q4, we expect to exit fiscal '21 with cloud ARR of $260 million to $290 million. We remain excited about our expanding cloud product road map, which includes continued co-development and deep R&D partnerships with the public cloud partners.  As we head into fiscal '22, we are investing in additional cloud sales capacity to support our expanding product road map and our partners' go-to-market motion. We remain confident in our ability to deliver $1 billion in cloud ARR in fiscal '25. Total product revenue of $775 million decreased approximately 2% year-over-year. As George noted, in the quarter, we saw good engagement from enterprise accounts, particularly in the Americas, where the sales capacity added last year is paying dividends. Consistent with the growth we delivered in Q2, software product revenue of $428 million increased 14% year-over-year, driven by the continued mix shift towards our all-flash portfolio.  Recurring maintenance and cloud revenue of $627 million was an all-time company high and was up 13% year-over-year, constituting 43% of total revenue. To help with your modeling of maintenance, please note Q3 includes a $7 million year-to-date adjustment from hardware maintenance revenue to software maintenance revenue. To be clear, this adjustment did not impact total maintenance revenue in the quarter.  Gross margin of 67.3% was at the high end of guidance. Product gross margin was 53.4% and consistent with our expectations. Our recurring maintenance, cloud and other services business continues to be a very profitable and growing business for us with gross margin of 82.9%.  Q3 operating expenses of $668 million were in line with our expectations. Operating margin of 21.9% and EPS of $1.10 were both nicely ahead of our guidance, demonstrating the strong operating leverage in our business model. Cash flow from operations was $373 million and free cash flow was $341 million, representing 23% of revenue. Year-to-date free cash flow of $650 million is up 13% year-over-year. We expect operating cash flow to grow double digits for the full fiscal year.  During Q3, we reinitiated our share repurchase program, buying back $50 million in stock. During the quarter, we also paid out $107 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $157 million to shareholders in Q3, representing 46% of free cash flow. We closed Q3 with $3.9 billion in cash and short-term investments.  Now to guidance. We expect Q4 net revenues to range between $1.44 billion and $1.54 billion, which at the midpoint implies a 6% increase in revenues year-over-year and includes 3 points of currency tailwind. Given our growing confidence in the business, we narrowed the revenue range to $100 million. We expect consolidated gross margin to be approximately 67% and operating margin to range between 21% and 22% in Q4. Assumed in this guidance, our operating expenses of $675 million to $685 million.  Given the magnitude of our cloud opportunity, we plan to pull forward investments in both sales capacity and our product road map, positioning our cloud services for continued rapid growth heading into fiscal '22. We anticipate our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 18%. And we expect earnings per share for Q4 to range between $1.06 and $1.14 per share. Assumed in this guidance is interest expense of $15 million.  In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for continued execution and commitment in delivering another outstanding quarter. We remain incredibly well positioned to capitalize on the industry transitions and market opportunity ahead. I'll now hand the call back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris? Kris Newton : Thanks, Mike. Let's open the call for Q&A. [Operator Instructions]. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Katy Huberty : I have two questions. The first is you're expecting cloud ARR sequential growth to accelerate next quarter. Can you just talk about, is that on the back of the investments that you're talking about accelerating in the quarter? Or is this just pipeline dynamics where you had some deals that maybe didn't convert in January and were pushed into the April quarter? George Kurian : It's on the back of pipeline dynamics. We have a strong pipeline heading into Q4 and it's our fiscal year-end, so we have every confidence that our sales teams are going to make a real good push to finish the year strong. We've had a really good year-to-date in Q3. We saw organic growth of 123% in cloud ARR as well as total growth of 186%. And if you look at the midpoint of our range that we have guided to, the incremental growth in Q4 is the same incremental number as what we did in Q2. So we feel good about the finish. The investments that Mike and I are both making is to help continue to scale the cloud business. The majority of the benefit of that will really be next fiscal year. Katy Huberty : Great. And then George, how would you compare the pipeline today, the broader deal pipeline today versus three months ago? And how does that shape your view of what the demand recovery will look like over the next several quarters? George Kurian : We've had three really good quarters. And if you look at our -- the finish to Q3, if you look at both days sales outstanding as well as inventory turns, we had a regular January, so linearity was good throughout the past quarter. Q4, the early signs are very constructive. The pipeline's strong. Our competitive position, I would not trade for anyone else in the market. So I feel really, really good about the opportunity ahead not only in Q4 but going forward.  I think what you see in our guidance is a bit of prudence, given that there's still a COVID environment. That while the vaccine availability provides incremental confidence, there are many other elements that need to come together to really give total line of sight to the new normal. That includes tax, regulation, new policy decision frameworks from the government, the stimulus package and other things. So we feel very good about the year. We feel really good about the pipeline heading into Q4. Our competitive position is strong and differentiated as we have demonstrated with share gains for 3 successive quarters. I think what we are trying to balance is the really good confidence in our business with the fact that we're still operating in a pandemic environment. Mike, you want to add? Michael Berry : So thanks, George. Katy, it's Mike. The 1 thing I'd add, too, is when you take a look at the guide, keep in mind that on a year-to-date basis, billings are up and that's really what we are focusing you folks on, about 7%, and revenue, when you adjust for the 14th week, is about three. So embedded in that guidance is still a pretty significant growth in billings, which to us is the leading indicator of business with our customers. Operator : Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani of Evercore. Amit Daryanani : I guess, I was just hoping you could talk a little bit more around the all-flash array growth, which double digits is fairly impressive. I guess, I'd love to understand, how much of this growth do you think is coming from conversion of your installed base to all-flash array versus net new customers? Is there a way to kind of piece that out? And then over time, what's the optimal level for this 27% of your installed base getting to as a percent of all-flash array? George Kurian : So our overall installed base, which is a very large number, is growing in both systems and customers, right? So we feel very, very good about the opportunity. We've been in this business in the all-flash array business for many, many years, and we are growing the penetration of the all-flash footprint in our installed base by roughly 1% a quarter. And so there's a long runway ahead, a very long runway ahead of all-flash penetration.  What we are feeling very, very good about is the fact that we've demonstrated share gains. We are not demonstrating the rate of penetration of the market and the rate of share gains without winning net new customers and net new workloads. Yes, installed base continues to be an opportunity, but what I feel really good about is the fact that we are growing at the expense of the competition this year. Operator : Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini of SIG. Mehdi Hosseini : Just as a follow-up to Amit's question, how should I think about the overall flash array growth this year? Because at this run rate, you can do perhaps high-teen growth and I want to just get more color on that. And I have a follow-up. George Kurian : I think there's two ways that I think about it. One is what's the aggregate market and then what's the percentage of the market that is all-flash. I think as we said, the aggregate market continues to get better steadily. We feel very good about the progress we've made as part of the overall market. We think that the macro trends this coming year should be better than what we had in the past year. There's a little bit of uncertainty with the specific timing of when everything gets better. But overall, sort of the bigger picture, there's no question that '21 calendar year will be a better year than '20.  I think within that, then we have gained share in the market. And within our overall portfolio, we see all-flash continuing to be a greater part of the mix, especially as newer technologies that make flash more cost-effective comes to market. So things like QLC, where we are in the early innings of. So as I said, we don't think flash will be 100% of the storage market. We think it will be a substantial percentage. And we think that, that transition affords us opportunity to gain share of new customers as well as to sell more software-rich, higher-margin configurations to customers. Mehdi Hosseini : Great. And just as a follow-up to that, how do you see material costs, specifically NAND costs, impacting and especially in the context of increased QLC procurement? Michael Berry : It's Mike. So I'll answer that in two ways. One is we did -- obviously, in the first half, we saw significantly higher NAND prices. They have modulated a bit and came back to, I'll call it, relatively flat in Q3. We do expect it to be a tailwind to us slightly in Q -- our Q4.  Looking into '22, I think you'll see that continue. We are starting to see some of the demand pick up, especially in the second half of next year, especially around mobile and hyperscalers as well. As you all know, mobile is 30%, 40% of that business. So we expect in the second half of next year for that to kind of reverse itself. Also, keep in mind, DRAM prices are up quite a bit for us. It's not nearly the percentage of component cost but that offsets a little bit. And for us, QLC, look, we're just getting started with that so there's not much of an impact, I'll call it, in the near term. Operator : Next question comes from Nik Todorov of Longbow Research. Nikolay Todorov : George, you talked about your cloud partners asking for additional broader workload certification. Maybe can you give us a little bit more color on that? And also, any additional color you can give us on the different customer sets that are adopting your cloud services? Is there any way you can delineate between the growth you're seeing from existing enterprise customers versus new cloud-only customers? And also, what are you seeing from your public sector customers when it comes to demand for CDS? George Kurian : Okay. So let me get that in three ways. The first was, listen, we are certified for a broad range of workloads with Microsoft and Google. And they are -- we are pursuing additional workloads with them as customers deploy on our platforms. This could be software vendors that are deploying Software as a Service environments in the public clouds. This could be new types of applications, containerized applications, cloud-native applications. There are a whole new set of opportunities for NetApp.  And it is also certifications and deployments in parts of the world where we haven't deployed yet. So we completed the FedRAMP certification, which opens up the public sector market for our Azure NetApp Files. There's opportunity to do that with other cloud providers and other services, for example, our monitoring services in the portfolio. That's 1 set of things that we're going to keep doing.  The other is expanding deployments. So we've covered -- with some of the cloud providers, we've covered the large markets. Now we are starting to pursue parts of the world, for example, in Asia Pacific or Latin America that we didn't cover before. And so this is the ongoing build-out.  I think with regard to the sets of customer types that we see, we are really excited at the progress that we've achieved this year. We are acquiring customers at an accelerating pace in our cloud business. And once they join NetApp's cloud portfolio, our dollar-based retention rate shows up really strongly. They really like our offerings and they expand deployment substantially with us.  They are across a broad range of verticals, more in the less regulated than in the regulated industries where we are still going through certifications. The second is they cover a broad range of customer types, whether they are digital natives that never bought from NetApp, enterprises that were primarily competitors, customers or customers that use NetApp.  As our all-flash array business and our cloud business have demonstrated for multiple quarters in a row, cloud is additive to our overall business. And there are customers who start with us in the cloud, who then come back and buy stuff in the data center. So very pleased with the progress. The work that we are doing with the cloud providers will continue to expand in scale and scope and which is why, again, I feel really good about our long-term opportunity and the ability to reach the $1 billion ARR target in fiscal year '25. Operator : Our next question is from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Steven Fox : I was wondering if you could just talk about what the impact of the mix of all-flash arrays was on margins, not necessarily -- I know I understand the software percentage help. But like I think last quarter, you benefited from larger-scale system sales. What was it like this quarter and what's your thinking into the next quarter? Michael Berry : Steven, it's Mike. Thanks for the question. So yes, we talked a lot in Q2 about the ASF, all-flash systems being driven by high end. And when we gave our guidance for Q3, we talked about, hey, we thought that would normalize a little bit and that's exactly what happened. So we had another very strong quarter in all-flash systems. But there's a little bit more, I'll call it, normally distributed between low, mid and high, and that's what we saw. And I think you can see that in the product margin. And then, again, they were helped a little bit by lower NAND costs. So it came in pretty much what we expected, much more normal distribution. And that's also what we're expecting going into Q4. Again, it's tough for us to do demand shaping of those because of the great flexibility in our products, our customers can do different configurations to still achieve that performance. So we expect it to be pretty normal and similar to Q3. Operator : Our next question is from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Shannon Cross : You've mentioned strength in the Americas enterprise. I wonder if you could dig a bit deeper into it, maybe on a sector basis. And then what are you seeing and hearing from your customers as you look forward over the next few quarters? You can either stick with Americas or you could go and talk geographically. George Kurian : I think I'll just say that we feel very good about the finish to Q3. The book of business was balanced geographically. We drew out the Americas because of the fact that the performance was particularly strong in the Americas. As you know, our business is preponderantly enterprise, meaning small, medium business is a small percentage of our total business. It didn't perform badly. It performed well but it's a small percentage of our total business.  On the enterprise, I think what we saw was a continuation of the trends that we saw in Q2, which is stabilization of demand, normal linearity through the quarter, the sort of COVID strong segments, meaning the ones that were -- had business models that were less impacted by COVID like financial services or health care, continue to be strong demand sources for us, and we have really good offerings in that part of the market.  I think with regard to the outlook, again, I think as we said, many, many customers are starting to prioritize the new normal, what business looks like going forward. Digital transformation becomes a key part of any business's go-forward plans, and we are a big part of enabling a modern data foundation for digital transformation. So those projects continue to move forward. NetApp has really good technology to also help in hybrid cloud and cybersecurity projects, for example, protection against ransomware and other types of malicious data threats. And we saw a good pickup across the portfolio for that as well. Operator : Next question is from Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. Ananda Baruah : Just love to get your thoughts, you talked about increasing the investment on sales capacity and yield coverage on cloud. Should we anticipate any impact to margins intermediate term as you ramp that? Or does the momentum just kind of overwhelm the incremental cost? Michael Berry : Ananda, it's Mike. So I think a little bit different than what we did last year was when we did a really great thing by bringing on the 200 sales folks. For us, this is just much more continued investment in that business. And I think that you'll see it more or less just play right into the P&L, as we've talked about, continued great growth in that business. So our goal is to continue to add sales capacity in line with that revenue growth to continue to drive it. So I wouldn't expect to see any kind of a bump on margins, specifically related to that. Operator : Sidney Ho of Deutsche Bank, your line is open. Sidney Ho : As I kind of look at your fiscal fourth quarter revenue guidance, at the midpoint, it will be up 6% year-over-year, up 1% quarter-over-quarter. Do you expect every reportable businesses to be up similarly on a sequential basis? I'm particularly interested in your comment on software maintenance, given how strong it was in the quarter. I understand there was a reclassification that helped the software side last quarter. Michael Berry : Yes. So if you bifurcate the different revenue numbers, and keep in mind, Sidney, that, that was, if you look at total maintenance, there was no impact to that. So as we look to Q4, we would expect to see maintenance continue to be strong in the quarter. I think sequentially, you saw maintenance actually drop a little bit. We would expect to see it grow slightly; cloud continue to grow; and then product revenue likely growing or similar levels to what we've seen in Q1, 2 and 3. And this goes back to Katy's question because again, I just want to keep talking about this is, keep in mind that billings growth has been 6%, 10% and 6% in the first three quarters. Product growth over that time when you back out the 14th week as an average about 3%. So mix matters here a lot. And so to that point and to the earlier question on maintenance, we do expect to see continued growth in maintenance as we do more off-line systems, continued growth in cloud and product revenue will be a result really of the mix in all-flash. Hopefully, that helps. Sidney Ho : Yes. Operator : Simon Leopold of Raymond James, your line is open. Victor Chiu : This is Victor Chiu in for Simon Leopold. I wanted to follow up on the enterprise spending question that someone asked previously. Do you have a sense for which areas enterprises will be prioritizing as they resume spending into recovery, for example, campus investments versus data center investments, et cetera, and how kind of NetApp falls into that picture? George Kurian : We don't do a lot of business in the campus. I think we -- the primary part of our business is in the data center. And I think as I mentioned earlier, we saw a good pickup in -- throughout the year, people have been prioritizing big transformational projects, which they cannot defer because they don't want to fall behind their competitors. We saw priorities in hybrid cloud and modernizing data center environments using flash technologies. Those are our key bets and they've played out really well for us throughout the year.  I think in Q3, we saw normal linearity. So you can see from our DSO and from our inventory turns that we did not have a back-end loaded quarter. It was pretty steady linearity throughout the quarter and we feel good about that. That's a good sign heading into the rest of the calendar year for us. And so we feel -- we've done well. We've controlled what we can control really well. The macro environment is still uncertain but it's getting better. And so we'll take those and we'll continue to execute. Victor Chiu : That's helpful. And just quickly along the lines of drivers, could you provide us an update around your as-a-service offering and progress you're seeing there? Has the pandemic disrupted the pushout the time line of kind of trials and acceptance around that? George Kurian : We serve customers in multiple ways. An as-a-service offering, we have ways to support them on public cloud environments, which are as a service and instantaneous we have the ability to give them financial solutions and/or managed subscription solutions. Our Keystone portfolio continues to make progress in the market. We have some good wins in the quarter. We've had some good successes against competitors and we feel really good about our offering there. It's early going. And we don't, unlike some of our other competitors, we don't think that the market has a single mandate. Customers want to buy in multiple ways, and we have the ability to meet those requirements in multiple ways. Operator : Karl Ackerman of Cowen, your line is open. Karl Ackerman : Mike, how should we think about the growth you're seeing in your as-a-service offerings between existing accounts versus new accounts? And I'm hoping you could shed light on the margin and content differential between new and existing accounts this quarter as well as in the context of your progression toward the $1 billion cloud ARR target? Michael Berry : Yes. So if we take a look at new versus existing accounts, as George talked about, we really look at the public cloud business as being the driver of new customers for us and we've seen that. In addition, when you look at the dollar-based net retention, but obviously, our existing customers, we're seeing great growth there as well. One of the nice things about the cloud business is from a margin perspective, it's not going to vary that much in terms of new versus existing. Certainly, existing customers that have more than 1 product, you'll start to see some margin expansion there as well.  But as we look across new versus existing, I don't think there's a material difference there. However, I think that will help expand those margins as we go forward. We've talked about our driver in terms of driving gross margins in the cloud business. Especially as they take on more than 1 product, more data services and more solutions, that will certainly help us scale that business at a higher margin. George Kurian : If I could add, as we mentioned at our Financial Analyst Day, cloud over time will become accretive to the margins -- gross margins of the overall business. We feel good about the progress we have made towards achieving that objective. We're not breaking out the cloud gross margins but we did make progress even this past quarter. So we're making steady progress towards achieving that objective. With regard to Keystone, Keystone does not -- we have not seen to date an existing customer that has an all-flash deployment suddenly show up and say, \"I want to convert that to a Keystone deployment.\" These are usually net new environments and customers and/or net new customers. It's not like we're seeing our traditional deployed environment convert to a Keystone basis. And so these are additive opportunities to our overall business and there are healthy margin opportunities. Operator : Next question comes from Rod Hall of Goldman Sachs. Roderick Hall : I just wanted to check in with you guys on supplies. I know the semiconductor supplies shortage is affecting a lot of people. Just curious if you could comment on whether you're anticipating that in the guide. And also what you think the supplies outlook is for the remainder of this year. And then maybe real quick, you could comment that AFA number was super strong again. Just comment on whether you think you gained share again and substantial share like you did last quarter or maybe a little bit less share. Just curious what you think that overall AFA market has done this quarter. Michael Berry : Rod, it's Mike. I'll take the first part and then George will jump in on the second one. So as we -- so when we looked at the semi supply chain, they have lots of news and noise out there on that one. We don't expect there to be any impact for Q4. As we look into next year, for us, it's hopefully not as much of a P&L impact. We will likely, like other folks, go buy ahead a little bit to make sure that we have enough of that supply. We had 19x inventory turns. We've talked about this back when I first started last year.  I intend to see that come down a little bit. It's the prudent thing to do, given the cost of capital to make sure we have that supply. So I would expect it to impact more of the balance sheet than the P&L. But certainly, we'll keep you up to speed as we go through this. George Kurian : With regard to the all-flash array number, we feel that we continue to take market share. I think that our portfolio continues to be the best 1 in the market. And based on other people that reported this week or today, we have taken share, right? So we'll wait for the rest of the roundup to come, but we feel really, really good about our position in the market. We've had 3 really good quarters. We're focused. We're executing and we're taking share. And I feel really good about our position, better today than even at the start of the year. Operator : Our next question is from Wamsi Mohan of Bank of America. Wamsi Mohan : You noted this pull forward in some of the spend relative to cloud. And I was wondering, A, are you changing or think that, that would change the CDS number of 400 to 500 for fiscal '22? And secondarily, how long should we expect that elevated OpEx? Is it a 1-quarter phenomena or is that going to be sort of the new normal and then we see OpEx sort of trend from there? Michael Berry : Yes. Wamsi, it's Mike. So on that, as we just talked a couple of minutes ago, we just expect to continue to invest in the cloud business as we see the opportunity and we clearly see a great opportunity. And that's in sales and in R&D to make sure we're moving the product road map forward. So I don't think, again, you'll see a bump or a reduction in the margins as it relates to that. The goal is to continue to invest in that as we go forward.  But we haven't -- we'll talk to you about where we think we'll finish next year when we get into fiscal '22. But we think that this is -- as you know, George and I have all talked about, hey, disciplined spending around OpEx. Disciplined spending for us also means we want to invest where we see a return and we absolutely see a return on those dollars. Wamsi Mohan : Okay. And if I could, sorry if I missed this, but you had extremely strong free cash flow margins in the quarter. Can you comment on what drove that? Michael Berry : Yes, absolutely. I'd love to talk about cash. So say, 2 things on cash, Wamsi. One is, keep in mind that compared to last year, we paid virtually all of our U.S. federal taxes in Q2 of last year. So let's talk about year-to-date. The margins were great in this quarter. I think it was 23%. On a year-to-date basis, our free cash flow is up 13% year-over-year. Also keep in mind that in that number in fiscal '21, we've also paid about $75 million of taxes related to the IP transfer from the spot acquisition. So it's actually a little bit stronger than that.  As George talked about, our DSOs were super strong. They were 49 days, below -- anytime you get below 50, it's great. So linearity certainly helped our invoicing and our collections in the quarter. But yes, very strong free cash flow results, feel really good about that on a year-to-date basis. Operator : Our next question is from Jim Suva of Citigroup Investment. James Suva : You've provided a lot of good clarity. And I have 1 question and it's probably best for both George and Mike to answer. But can you just walk us through, when NAND pricing goes higher, like, George, how does your sales force react to that? And then, Mike, maybe the margin and revenue impact, does it impact margins a lot? Can you offset it fast enough or does your billings get impacted favorably from higher NAND prices or not? I'm just kind of worried -- I'm not worried. I'm wondering about the relationships, the talks and the financial of when component pricing, since you're doing so well in all-flash arrays, when NAND component prices go up, what's the sales force reaction and the financial implications? George Kurian : Okay. Maybe I can start first. We have a broad range of purchasing agreements with customers. I think for some, there are preferred pricing agreements or master purchasing agreements where they are locked into pricing schedules where we don't have the ability to move pricing up or down depending on what happens to NAND prices. In the transactional environment, where there's no long-term pricing agreements, we are -- we take a look at the impact of commodity prices. We typically pass that through either beneficially or to disadvantage to customers. We're not trying to hedge it.  I think we are cognizant this time in the COVID environment of the particular challenge that our customers face so we try to be a good partner to them. As Mike and I both said at Financial Analyst Day, post COVID, given the continued progress of our all-flash array business, we see the ability to return to the mid-50s product gross margins. Michael Berry : Yes. Just to keep going on that path, Jim, as George talked about, we do see that path. We don't expect to see the kind of increases that we saw, I think, earlier in the first half. Supply and demand will certainly dictate that. The other thing to keep in mind, too, and this is why we've talked about this so much, I will always push you to look at total gross margins because also, hey, cloud billings, not impacted by it. The more we do renewals, which is a huge part of our business, and it's been a great success story also helps as well. So from a financial perspective, this is something we look at, sure. But there are so many other things, too, that drive it.  Keep in mind, NAND may go up, DRAM may go down, something else may move around. We have a great supply chain team. They're looking at it all the time in terms of what it means financially. But again, we don't know going into next year where in the final supply and demand will end. We'll certainly keep you up-to-date every quarter. Operator : Next question comes from Nehal Chokshi of Northland Capital. Nehal Chokshi : Great quarter and it looks like good guidance for me. Can you talk about -- it was great that you guys are talking about a $1 billion ARR by fiscal year '25 for public cloud services. But what do you expect to be the sustainable growth rate after you get there? And what's sustainable dollar-based net revenue retention rate to drive that as well? George Kurian : Listen, I think we have strong aspirations to grow our cloud business. I think we have every confidence that we have a multiyear game plan of achieving the $1 billion ARR number. I think we will give you the ability to sustain growth rates beyond that when we get to it. What I'll give you a sense of is, cloud is a gigantic market, and the growth of cloud over the next 5 years will be much bigger than the growth of cloud over the past 5 years. So if you think that there is constraints to overall TAM, I just think that even the $1 billion ARR will be a small part of the overall cloud market in that time frame. So we're not TAM-constrained. I think our position in the market is unique, and we are continuing to execute on product road map expansions and go-to-market investments, as Mike and I have talked about in prepared remarks.  With regard to dollar-based net retention, I think it reflects the strength of our offerings. When a customer signs up and is activated and starts to work with us, they grow substantially in terms of their usage of our products, which is really good. I think both Mike and I see that over time, it should trend back towards more industry norms. I think 227%, which we had this quarter, is well above industry norms, reflecting the early phase of our cloud journey. Mike, feel free to add. Michael Berry : Yes. Keep going on that path, and we talked about this at Investor Day. We do expect this to come back, call it, industry norms, if that's, call it, 110, 120, 130. Very importantly, once you get to $1 billion and you that, certainly, we want it to continue to be a driver of new customers. But gosh, that upsell, cross-sell renewal, that motion is so critical. That's actually part of the sales investment that we're making is to make sure we have that great support team that can go in there and help our customers once they sign up for those services. And there's a lot of great examples of companies that do that well. So we do expect, in conjunction with getting there, that we'll be able to continue to drive great retention but it will come down to the industry norms over time. Nehal Chokshi : Okay, great. And then if I can bring that into -- on a shorter-term basis. You've provided a target of $260 million to $290 million for the end of this year. At the low end of that range, what would have to occur? Because that seems like that would be probably a disappointing outcome. And then conversely, at the high end of the range, what would have to happen is that would seem to be an amazing outcome actually. George Kurian : I think it's all execution. I think we see a good -- a strong pipeline in Q4. It comes down to transaction execution, getting customers signed up, managing through the COVID challenges that customers are still facing, right? We have customers whose employees are not on site, who we can get to negotiate with only a certain number of days of the week. And that's what it comes down to.  I think the overall demand profile for our services is fantastic. I think we've added customers at an accelerating pace through the course of the year. And the types of workloads that we are deploying, these are mega-market opportunities, databases, virtual machines, file sharing, high-performance computing. So we're not opportunity-constrained. I think we just got to execute and bring in the transactions. Operator : Next question comes from Jason Ader of William Blair. William Fitzsimmons : This is Billy Fitzsimmons on for Jason Ader. I know you talked about how Spot was a standout in the quarter, and you also talked about at the Analyst Day how there are only 5% of customers where there's overlap between Spot and NetApp. And obviously, there have also been some changes to your sales org in the last couple of quarters, Cesar joined in July. So to that end, George, can you please talk on how the typical customer conversation has evolved versus a year or 2 ago, given some of those leadership changes as well as the introduction of some newer products and some of those products from acquisitions such as talent jump Spot George Kurian : Yes. I think, first of all, we have a massively larger customer base now than we did a couple of years ago, right? Even a year ago, we have a massively larger customer base, whether that's acquired through NetApp sales force, whether that's acquired through Microsoft or Google sales force or Spot, the installed base of customers to whom we can cross-sell and upsell products, like Mike mentioned, is massively larger at this point than it was a year ago.  I think with regard to what Spot brings to the table is they bring 2 assets to the table. One is that they are able to solve a large and growing customer problem, which is the problem of unused or unspent cloud dollars, and that is a topic that is near and dear to every CFO and CIO that I talk to, including Mike at NetApp. We're a customer of Spot and they save us a substantial amount of money. We are able to use Spot not only to go after cloud-native digital native customers that never bought from NetApp, as well as to now find ways into new parts of large enterprises that didn't know NetApp and now get pleasantly surprised by the whole cloud portfolio. So I'm super excited.  They also have a really good offering for container-based workloads that, in combination with some of our storage offerings, gives us a really expanded set of differentiated capabilities for truly cloud-native applications. Operator : And our last question comes from Paul Chung of JPMorgan. Paul Chung : So you mentioned nice market share gains in all-flash, so just a follow-up there. Can you just expand on how you're displacing competitors? Which types of verticals you're seeing more success? I know your gross margins are down mostly on mix, but any impact from pricing? Just anything you want to highlight on how you're beating competition? George Kurian : With regard to the competitive programs, our Run to NetApp competitive program continues to have really good results. Q3 was the strongest of the 3 quarters that we've had the program running. And it is a broad mix of customers. Given the mix of our business, they're mostly enterprise accounts. And we are winning new footprint, meaning new workloads displacing the larger legacy incumbents. So whether it's an HP or a Hitachi with their products, or whether it's Dell going through a transition of its midrange, we are winning against those players.  The strength of NetApp is our software differentiation. The fact that we can simplify a customer's data center quite substantially with a single unified architecture and be able to give them a good road map to cloud in a way that nobody else can do. And the midrange is the sweet spot, right? That's the place where it's the largest market segment and it is where we are most differentiated. So we feel really good. We've got to just keep executing. We've got the game plan in place. We're focused. We're driving good results. We just got to keep on it. And I feel really good about the progress we've made to date. Kris Newton : All right. Thank you, Paul. I'm going to pass it over to George for some final comments. George Kurian : Thanks, Kris. In closing, I want to again thank the NetApp team for delivering another quarter of solid results. It's been over a year since the COVID pandemic impacted all of our lives. And despite this challenging environment, we have successfully executed against our strategy. We have refocused the business and shown that we can grow both our cloud storage, our core storage and cloud businesses simultaneously.  We have improved execution and our increased sales capacity continues to yield positive results. And we've maintained fiscal discipline, maintaining operating margins of 20% year-to-date. As the recovery unfolds, I'm confident that we're in a great position to continue to capitalize on the growing importance of data and on our unique position in helping customers manage their data in the hybrid cloud. Thank you. Stay safe, and we'll talk to you again next quarter. God bless. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may all disconnect. Have a great day.",

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. I would now like to turn the call over to, Kris Newton, Vice President, Investor Relations. Kris Newton : Thank you for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Mike Berry. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com. During today\u2019s call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year 2022; our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability, and shareholder returns; and our ability to continue overall growth, gain market share, and scale our cloud business, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially for a variety of reasons, including macroeconomic and market conditions such as the continuing impact and uneven recovery of the COVID-19 pandemic; and the IT capital spending environment; as well as our ability to gain share in the storage market, grow our cloud business, and generate greater cash flow. Please also refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, and available on our website, specifically our most recent Forms 10-Q and 10-K including in the \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors\u201d sections. During the call all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are posted on our website. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to George. George Kurian : Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Before we get started, I want to take a minute to acknowledge that it\u2019s been over a year that we have all been working remotely. I\u2019m encouraged by the public health and economic improvements in many parts of the world, but the recovery is uneven. As you know, we have a large team in India. Our thoughts are with them, as they deal with a distressing surge in COVID cases. Thank you to the entire NetApp team for your dedication, focus, and execution throughout this challenging year. Now to the results of the quarter. We delivered strong fourth quarter results, capping off a solid year of growth. Our results were all above our Q4 guidance ranges. I am most excited by the return of product revenue to growth, the strength of our public cloud ARR, and an all-time high free cash flow. Our performance was broad-based, as certain verticals, the U.S., and parts of Europe and Asia are recovering faster than many expected. Cloud and digital transformation initiatives have been accelerated by the pandemic and companies look to NetApp to support these key initiatives. Going into FY21, we had two clear priorities : returning to growth in our storage business powered by share gains from our industry-leading file, block and object software and scaling our highly differentiated public cloud services business. As I reflect on the past year, I am proud of what we have achieved during a globally challenging period. We remained focused in executing our strategy and extending our innovation. In Q4, product revenue grew 6% and our all-flash array business grew 11% year-over-year. Based on our growth, I am confident that we have gained share in the storage and all-flash markets. We advanced our hybrid cloud portfolio with the introduction of ONTAP 9.9 and Astra. This innovation will support continued product revenue growth and share gains through fiscal year \u201822. Additionally, we continue to make good progress with Keystone, with many new wins, including our largest ever Keystone deal. We are reaching more customers than ever before with our public cloud business. Over the course of fiscal year \u201821, we added approximately 1,500 new-to-NetApp customers with public cloud services and grew our total cloud customer count by 137% from Q4 fiscal year \u201820. In addition to adding new cloud customers, existing cloud customers are expanding their spend with us. Our dollar-based net revenue retention rate increased to 252% in the fourth quarter. Cloud Volumes, Cloud Insights, and Spot all performed well in the quarter, driving our public cloud services ARR to $301 million exiting fiscal year \u201821, an increase of 171% year-over-year. As we have said repeatedly, our cloud strategy strongly advantages NetApp. I\u2019ll use a customer example to illustrate how cloud helps us to acquire new customers and drive growth in our on-premises solutions. As a part of its digital transformation strategy, a leading car manufacturer decided to migrate workloads from its on-premises data centers to the Azure cloud. Despite never having used NetApp previously, the customer chose NetApp Cloud Volumes to host its file-based data and NetApp Cloud Sync to rapidly move data from its Dell EMC systems to the cloud. In addition to delivering a high-performance data store in the cloud, Cloud Volumes provides out-of-the box cross region replication of production data to a secondary cloud environment, high availability to meet the service level requirements of critical applications, and cost savings through automatic tiering to Azure Blob Storage. Because of the breadth and depth of the value NetApp delivered, the customer is now looking to deploy a hybrid cloud environment and plans to use NetApp on-premises, as well as increase its NetApp usage in the public cloud. As I noted earlier, the pandemic accelerated and elevated the importance of customers\u2019 cloud and digital transformation initiatives. We expect that this trend will be ongoing, and that NetApp will continue to benefit from it. Customers appreciate the value we bring as a cloud-led, data-centric software company to simplify and modernize existing data centers, to quickly and confidently deploy applications, and to securely manage data on the public cloud. We have long been recognized for our industry-leading enterprise data management technology; our cloud solutions drive further differentiation, expand our addressable market, and enable us to reach new customers. We began our cloud journey seven years ago, with the introduction of Cloud ONTAP, now, Cloud Volumes ONTAP. Our initial focus was to leverage the cloud to deliver backup and disaster recovery services to our installed base. We saw that enterprises wanted to move workloads to the cloud. To address that need, we began working with the leading cloud providers to deliver Cloud Volumes Service, a fully managed service with the application certifications required to support mission-critical, production workloads in the cloud. We then recognized the opportunity to expand beyond storage management and optimization to infrastructure monitoring and compute management and optimization services, which led to the development of Cloud Insights and the acquisition of Spot. These services, Cloud Volumes, Cloud Insights, and Spot, are now the primary growth engines of our public cloud services business. They are well established for enterprise applications, and we are taking each of them into the cloud native world, further expanding our market opportunity. NetApp Astra offers application-aware data management that protects, moves, and manages data-rich Kubernetes workloads. Spot Ocean automates cloud infrastructure for containers, automatically scaling compute resources to maximize utilization and availability while minimizing costs. Cloud Insights for Kubernetes provides simplified infrastructure monitoring to quickly identify performance issues and resource constraints. Together, our public cloud services give our customers, and especially their CloudOps and DevOps teams, a robust suite of multi-cloud infrastructure management services. We plan to press our advantage here by focusing our efforts on enhancing our go-to-market activities, deepening our cloud partnerships, and delivering best-in-class organic and inorganic innovations. We intend to leverage our deep infrastructure expertise and our credibility with the cloud providers to expand our multi-cloud infrastructure management services. My confidence in our ability to reach our goal of $1 billion in public cloud ARR in fiscal year \u201825 is further enhanced by the strength and uniqueness of our cloud services position. Our focused execution last year has set us up well for fiscal year \u201822. We have returned to growth, we are gaining share in key storage markets, and our public cloud services are at a scale where they are positively impacting total company billings and revenue growth. Our momentum underscores our value to customers in a hybrid, multi-cloud world. In fiscal year \u201822, we plan to accelerate our public cloud services and continue to grow our hybrid cloud business. I am excited about the year ahead and confident in our ability to deliver top line growth by supporting our customers on their cloud and digital transformation journeys. Before I turn it over to Mike to walk through our financial results, I want to take a moment to thank Brad Anderson, who let us know that he intends to retire at the end of fiscal year \u201822. Brad has been instrumental in leading the maturation of our Hybrid Cloud Group, and we will continue to leverage his leadership and expertise this year. We are actively engaged in identifying his successor to ensure a smooth transition. With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mike. Mike Berry : Thank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I\u2019ll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. As we look back on what was an unprecedented year, I cannot help but be incredibly proud of the focus, execution, and commitment of the entire NetApp team. We delivered billings of $5.9 billion, an increase of 9% year-over-year, while revenue of $5.7 billion grew 6%. We delivered free cash flow of $1.2 billion, up 25% year-over-year, while continuing to aggressively invest in our public cloud franchise. We finished the year strong, with Q4 billings of $1.7 billion, up 12% year-over-year, while revenue of $1.6 billion was up 11% year-over-year. Both were solidly ahead of our expectations, driven by accelerating enterprise demand throughout the quarter. Gross margin, operating margin and EPS all came in above the high-end of guidance. Q4 free cash flow of $521 million was an all-time high for NetApp. As George highlighted, public cloud ARR of $301 million was up 171% year-over-year and an impressive 27% sequentially. In fiscal \u201821, the scale of our cloud franchise really started to impact the overall growth profile of NetApp, delivering 4 of the 9 points in billings growth and 3 of the 6 points in revenue growth. In addition to the strong cloud ARR performance, we are excited that we exited the year with cloud gross margins near our overall corporate average. Given the growing impact on our total Company performance, we anticipate sharing more detail on our public cloud business in fiscal \u201822. When combined, software revenue, recurring support and cloud revenue totaled $1.1 billion and increased 18% year-over-year, representing 72% of total revenue. For the first time in company history, we ended Q4 with over $4 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 8% year-over-year. Deferred revenue continues to be a leading indicator for future recurring revenue growth. Product revenue returned to growth in Q4, importantly, we expect this trend to continue throughout fiscal \u201822. Product revenue of $840 million increased 6% year-over-year. Consistent with the trends we have seen throughout fiscal \u201821, software product revenue of $480 million dollars increased 18% year-over-year, driven by the continued mix shift towards our all-flash portfolio. Recurring support and cloud revenue of $641 million was also an all-time Company high and was up 17% year-over-year, constituting 41% of total revenue. Gross margin of 67.3% was at the high-end of guidance. Product gross margin was 54.3% and benefited from the higher all-flash system mix. Our recurring support, cloud and other services business continues to be a very profitable and growing business for us, with gross margin of 82%. Operating margin of 23% was nicely ahead of our expectations, while EPS of $1.17 came in above the high end of guidance, despite a $0.05 headwind from a higher than forecasted tax-rate. Cash flow from operations was $559 million and free cash flow was $521 million, representing 34% of revenue. Cash flow came in higher than expected in part due to strong collections, as evidenced by the DSO metric of 55 days. Full-year fiscal \u201821 free cash flow of $1.2 billion was up 25% year-over-year and represented 20% of revenue. We closed Q4 with $4.6 billion in cash and short-term investments. Given recent developments in the broader technology supply chain, I want to reiterate our confidence in our ability to meet end-demand as we head into Q1. We have an excellent supply chain team and they have been working closely with our partner ecosystem to ensure backlog and customer lead-times remain at normal levels throughout fiscal \u201822. Towards this goal, we will be investing incremental dollars into inventory and longer-term commitments to help mitigate risk of supply shortages. Given our strong balance sheet and low cost of capital, we feel good about this investment. Now to guidance. In fiscal \u201822, we expect revenues to grow 6% to 7% year-over-year, with billings expected to outpace revenue given the continued strength in recurring support contracts and cloud services. In fiscal \u201822, we expect continued momentum and share gains in our cloud-connected all-flash portfolio. We will also continue to grow and invest in our diversified public cloud services portfolio. We are raising the low-end our fiscal \u201822 guide and now expect to exit fiscal \u201822 with public cloud ARR of $425 million to $500 million, driven by enhanced go-to-market activities, deeper cloud partnerships and continued product innovation. Similar to the seasonal pattern we experienced in fiscal \u201821, we anticipate Q2 and Q4 to be our strongest quarters for net new public cloud ARR. This seasonal cadence is driven by our semi-annual sales compensation plans. As George noted, we have increased confidence in our ability to eclipse $1 billion in public cloud ARR in fiscal \u201825. In fiscal \u201822, we expect gross margin to be roughly flat year-over-year at 67% to 68%, as improving cloud margins are balanced with strong demand for our hybrid cloud products. We anticipate operating margin to range between 21% and 22%, as we continue to invest in our growth initiatives, while delivering strong operating leverage. Implied in this guidance is our expectation that operating expenses will be between $2.75 and $2.8 billion. The year-over-year increase in our expense base is being driven by continued investment in revenue generating activities, including expanding our cloud portfolio, targeted investments in sales resources and continued investment in our customer success sales team. Moving down the P&L, we expect interest expense to be $65 million to $70 million and our effective tax-rate to be approximately 19%. While we get a bit of delevering below the operating income line, as a result of the higher interest expense and tax rate, we are committed to delivering $4.45 to $4.65 in fiscal \u201822 EPS, representing 12% year-over-year growth, at the mid-point. We expect to again generate over $1.1 billion in free cash flow in fiscal \u201822, as our hybrid cloud business continues to fund the growth in our cloud services franchise. Factored into the year-over-year free cash flow generation is a step-up in CapEx to $225 million to $235 million. Our public cloud partners, in particular Azure, are driving us hard to build out additional global capacity for our cloud offerings. Even with this added investment, we expect cloud gross margins to become accretive to our corporate average as we move through fiscal \u201822. Generating over $1.1 billion in free cash will allow us to continue to deliver on our capital allocation commitments, while also investing in our key strategic areas. The dividend will remain the first call on capital. As you saw today, we raised our quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share. Share repurchases will also continue to play a key role in our capital allocation strategy. Towards this goal our Board approved an additional $500 million in buyback authorization. In fiscal \u201822, we expect buybacks to offset dilution from our equity plans. For modeling purposes, we expect share count to remain flat at 229 million shares, exiting fiscal \u201822. Consistent with NetApp\u2019s long history of disciplined M&A, the remaining 30% of free cash generation will go towards our acquisition strategy, which will remain focused on bolstering our strategic cloud services roadmap. Now on to Q1 guidance. We expect Q1 net revenues to range between $1.37 billion and $1.47 billion which, at the midpoint, implies a 9% increase in revenues year-over-year. We expect consolidated gross margin to be approximately 68% and operating margin to range between 19% and 20%. Assumed in this guidance are Q1 operating expenses of $680 million to $690 million. We anticipate our tax rate to be approximately 19%. And we expect earnings per share for Q1 to range between $0.89 and $0.97 per share. Assumed in our Q1 guidance is interest expense of $15 million to $20 million. In closing, I want to thank our partners, customers and investors for their unwavering support this past year. And most importantly, a huge shout out to the entire NetApp employee base for redefining what it means to work as a team, during what was a challenging year in so many ways. We are more confident than ever in our ability to capitalize on the industry transitions and market opportunity ahead. I\u2019ll now hand the call back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris? Kris Newton : Thanks, Mike. Let\u2019s open the call for Q&A. Please keep to just one question so we can get to as many people as possible. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Amit Daryanani : Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the nice strength. I was hoping if you could just talk a little bit more on the cloud data services business. And I guess, a, I would love to understand sort of what really drove the upside in the quarter versus the $260 million to $290 million guide that you already had out there? And then, really, when I think about the full year number you provided of $425 million to $500 million, the low end, I think, is ticking up by $20 million -- $25 million. What is driving the confidence in this business as you go into next year? And how important is it for you to scale beyond Azure to achieve the fiscal year targets laid out? George Kurian : Thank you for the question. We have been working on multiple innovation parts of our portfolio, all of which performed extremely strongly. Cloud Volumes for storage; Cloud Insights for monitoring; Spot for compute management, all had really strong Q4s and overall, really strong years. We saw good expansion in the number of customers and strong growth in the number of new-to-NetApp customers. We saw customers spending against their digital transformation and their cloud programs throughout the quarter. So, it was a smooth trajectory through the quarter. And I think that sets us up well for next year. I think, if you look at our dollar-based net retention rate, you can see that our organic business grew strongly this year, and we had about $60 million of this year being inorganic from acquisitions of Spot, Talon and CloudJumper. So, when you back that out, we expect next year\u2019s growth rate to also continue the acceleration of our organic portfolio and continued strength of our inorganic portfolio. We have a really good and differentiated portfolio of services. We have deep partnerships and are expanding the range of things we do with the hyperscalers. And we are growing our customer base of people who are doing many business-critical projects on the public clouds with us. So, I\u2019m really excited with every confidence. We\u2019ll tell you more about our cloud business, as Mike indicated, as we go through the year, giving you more details on it. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Rod Hall : I\u2019m going to do the old question and clarification thing, if I can. The question is on ARR and what the ceiling on that is. Obviously, you\u2019ve done really well there. And I\u2019m curious if you could George, maybe just give us some idea of what the -- what do you think the headroom is there? Because clearly, there\u2019s a lot of growth coming through. And then, the clarification just on the EPS calculations for the full year guide. We\u2019re getting a number lower than the range you guys are giving. So, I\u2019m not sure if using all the inputs you\u2019re talking about, we get something like $4.41. So, I\u2019m not sure, if you add all that up, why we would be ending up at a different place than maybe your guide is. So, I don\u2019t know, Mike or if you could clarify that, that would be helpful. Thanks. George Kurian : Thanks, Rod. With regard to the cloud portfolio, listen, I think the heavy lift in terms of getting the innovation portfolio to be in really good shape is behind us. I think, we have, as I said, three really strong innovation engines, and we are bringing out cloud-native innovations across those lineups as well through the course of the summer. We are making investments, as we indicated last quarter, to accelerate and expand the range of things we\u2019re doing in the cloud portfolio. With regard to what\u2019s it going to take to further accelerate the course of the business, it\u2019s all the things that we\u2019re doing, right? We\u2019re expanding the number of sellers and revenue-generating teams facing customers. We\u2019ve seen really good success with Microsoft in terms of their route to market. We\u2019re working with the other hyperscalers to also train and expand the range of ways we take our products to market with them. And we\u2019re building our customer service and customer success teams. I feel even more confident that we have the range of capabilities to achieve the $1 billion target in ARR that we indicated. And the customer use cases that we are deploying on our public cloud portfolios, these are run the business applications, mission-critical, highly differentiated business value-creating application. So, I feel really, really good about where we are at the year. Mike, do you want to take the other part of the question? Mike Berry : Sure. Thanks, George. Hey, Rod. So, I just want to make sure -- we could go through it separately with you and the team. We want to make sure that hey, the gross interest is not the net interest. It could be in the OIE calculation as well, so. And there\u2019s a lot of sensitivity, obviously, to that count. So, it\u2019s probably below operating income that it\u2019s a little bit different in our model. We\u2019re happy to walk you through that separately. Rod Hall : Mike, just for the call, could you maybe say what that OI&E number is? Then people can just plug that in. Mike Berry : Yes. So, we said 65 to 70 for the interest. For the OIE that we have in there is -- yes, that\u2019s the interest, that\u2019s what we did on the -- in my script. And as you know, that number jumps around quite a bit. There\u2019s more than just obviously, interest in that OIE number. Operator : Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. And congratulations on the quarter, clearly confident in kind of how the story is progressing. I know you touched on this in your prepared remarks a little bit. But, I just wanted to go back to kind of the component environment. There\u2019s a lot of discussion out there around SSDs and some controller constraints, and pricing moving upward on flash and SSDs in general. Just help us maybe appreciate the confidence that you have in component supply and how you\u2019re reacting to any kind of inflationary pricing dynamic? Thank you. Mike Berry : Sure. Hey Aaron, it\u2019s Mike. Thanks for the question. So, we have certainly contemplated the challenges in the supply chain when providing our gross margin guidance for Q1 and fiscal \u201822. Supply chain teams, they\u2019ve really performed well all year long, working closely with our suppliers. And we have confidence we can continue that performance this coming year. As you know, we\u2019re a cloud world software company. Our product margins, we expect to continue to benefit from the higher-margin software-rich configurations. And we continue to do a lot of hard work on the services margin. As we talked about, cloud margins should continue to improve as we go through the year, as well as you\u2019ll see the benefits of the consumption of the deployed system and more increase in our Software-as-a-Service. There\u2019s always unforeseen circumstances that may come into play. But as we sit here today, we feel good about it. And, when you talk about total -- our total component cost, we expect it to be a little bit of a tailwind in the first half. And then, based on prices that we have today and you know as well as those things change, potentially a little bit of a headwind in the second half when we take that into our guidance. George Kurian : With regard to our technology portfolio, as Mike said, we have a range of configurations that we can support our customers with all the way from 900 gigs to 16 terabytes. And so, we have plenty of capability to given the flexibility in our software operating system to qualify the right components to meet customer needs and support them. With regard to the demand environment and gross margins, listen, as Mike said, we\u2019ve operated through a tough year and done a really good job. I think that you\u2019ll see us continue to remain prudent, balancing end-user demand with margin management as we go through the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Nik Todorov with Longbow Research. Nik Todorov : Yes. Thanks, and congrats from me as well on the great results. George, I do appreciate the full year guide. I\u2019m just wondering if we can double click maybe on the revenue outlook, 6% to 7% growth. Can you give some more color around the assumptions there? Maybe if you can talk how much of that comes from share gains versus the market or any breakdown between the drivers of product or CDS or software? Thank you. George Kurian : Okay. Listen, as we go through the year, we see a continuing improvement in public health and the overall demand environment. We have been benefiting from cloud and digital transformation projects through the course of the year. We have not seen any major -- so we don\u2019t see some unique snapback or something like that in government spending or in enterprise spending. We see us benefiting from long-term trends and projects that are strategic to customers. We see more countries, especially the U.S. and parts of Western Europe come on line in a more significant way through the course of our fiscal year, the U.S. more likely in the first part of the fiscal year, Europe coming on line more strongly in the second half of our fiscal year. We have every confidence that our product portfolio is differentiated, and we\u2019ll continue to see product revenue grow faster than services revenue and the strength of our cloud portfolio. We have a much bigger base of customers now in the cloud business. We have a much broader range of application certifications that we entered last year. And so, we feel really, really good about the year ahead. Operator : Our next question comes from Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. Matt Cabral : Yes. Thank you. I was wondering if you can give an update on the ramp of the 200 quota-bearing heads that you\u2019ve added over the past, I think it was 18 months or so. Just where they are in their ramps relative to full productivity? And as we\u2019re heading into fiscal \u201822, just how you\u2019re thinking about investments in sales capacity for the next fiscal year and beyond? George Kurian : I think, as we said, the typical sales productivity ramp happens over the course of four quarters. We are -- the 200 reps that we started adding in fiscal year \u201820 are fully productive. They\u2019re part of NetApp teams. You saw some of the benefits from their performance and additions to our teams, particularly in the Americas business, which was really strong, and it sets us up well for what we think will be a strong American recovery over the course of the next 12 months. With regard to continued additions, as Mike has said and what we have said before, we continue to be prudent about where we add those teams. We will do so where we see demand and environments being strong. And we\u2019ll tell you more about the course of that. We added some headcount in our customer success teams and in our cloud teams this past quarter. You should anticipate us continuing to do that to support the growth of the cloud portfolio. But, Mike, if you want to add any other color? Mike Berry : Yes. Thanks, George. So, I would just underline the additions that we talked about last quarter and this quarter as well into specific areas around cloud, and then the customer success team which is, as you all know, in a cloud business super important in terms of upsell, cross-sell renewals. So, we do continue to make investments there. And I think you\u2019ve seen some of the results in the ARR results this quarter. Operator : Next question comes from Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Public cloud profitability is ramping faster alongside the better revenue performance. Is that purely due to revenue scale, or have you tuned the business model in any way to capture cost efficiencies? And then, Mike, just as a follow-up to that, can you clarify whether we should expect cloud margins for the full year 2022 to be dilutive, neutral or accretive to the model? Thank you. Mike Berry : Sure. Thanks for the question, Katy. Let me do the last one first. So, we said, as we go through the year, we expected cloud margins to be accretive to the total Company average. So, as we get through the year and certainly ending the year. And then, yes, we have seen a much bigger increase in our cloud margins than we had originally expected. Certainly, scale -- revenue scale matters. I would also give a lot of kudos to the team, though, for being really efficient in terms of how they use not only the hardware, but also all this stuff that goes to support those businesses as it relates to people and process. So, it\u2019s all of the above. But certainly, growth in ARR is the key driver followed next by a really good job by that team in terms of managing the margins. George Kurian : Katy, I think we have many avenues as we have described to continue to drive the gross margins in our cloud business. There\u2019s a growing portfolio of software-only offerings in the cloud business. Spot, Cloud Insights, several versions of our Cloud Volumes offerings are all software. We -- Mike mentioned the hardware utilization. We have brought out new versions of our ONTAP operating systems that continue to be more efficient in terms of data management and storage efficiency. And so, we feel very good about our path to continuing to improve cloud gross margins in the direction that Mike articulated. Operator : Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Wamsi Mohan : You noted some seasonality in Cloud ARR through the course of the year where Q2, Q4 are typically higher. I was wondering, is it -- would it be accurate to think that the net organic growth sequentially should be at least at a higher level relative to last year, even though we look at some -- maybe some seasonality going into Q1? And can you give us any color on these cloud deals, how much of those were NAV generated versus partner generated? Thank you. Mike Berry : Yes. So, on the organic growth, Wamsi, what I -- this is Mike, by the way. I would point you to the dollar-based net retention number. And as you saw in the quarter, it actually accelerated quarter-over-quarter. So, you can assume, if you take a look at that the organic business is doing -- call it, the organic business is doing very, very well. And as George talked about, a lot of those offerings are -- is that organic business. And we don\u2019t break out the contributions from the hyperscalers versus the core business or the NetApp business. What I would say is a lot of the seasonal pickup that you see in Q2 and Q4 is driven by our sales teams, in addition, obviously, with the hyperscalers. And I just want to underline that, please, which is, hey, when you guys do your models for next year, please make sure that you take that seasonality into account. Don\u2019t just take the increase in ARR and divide by 4. There is absolutely seasonality in that business as you\u2019ve seen in the last two years. Operator : Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Steven Fox : George, I was just wondering, when I listened to everything that you said, you talked about improving market share. It sounds like a better mix as you go through the year. You had accelerating digital transformation engagements during the quarter and into this quarter. And then, when I look at the full year guidance, it seems to imply when I look at the market, you\u2019re expecting some sort of deceleration as you go up throughout the year, even when I take into account some of the tougher comparisons. Am I thinking about that conservatism right, or is there anything else you would say on the markets? Thanks. Mike Berry : Listen, I think when we look at the full year guidance for next year, we\u2019ve guided 6% to 7% in terms of revenue growth. I think that what you see from us is real confidence in the business. The second half of the year is on a compare basis compared to a stronger second half this year as enterprise spending came back on line through COVID, right? So, it isn\u2019t an expectation of us having a deceleration in terms of our ability to grow cloud or gain share. It\u2019s just a kind of a realization that the second half of this year is a stronger compare than the first half of this year. Operator : The next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Jim Suva : Thank you. My question and it\u2019s kind of a clarification, but also related forward-looking is, can you clarify for this quarter, how much of the revenues were organic versus acquisition? And then, the outlook, George, I know you mentioned $1 billion run rate. Is that based upon all organic? I assume that\u2019s the case. But I just wanted to clarify because I think Mike mentioned about 30% of cash flow could be used for M&A. But I just kind of want to clarify organic versus M&A as you sit today, reported and as you look out. And again, congratulations on the great results and outlook. Mike Berry : Hey Jim, it\u2019s Mike. On the first one from the organic contribution of revenue, it was very small. It was less than 0.5 percentage point of growth. It was really not much at all in terms of -- but keep in mind that that is related to the cloud acquisitions earlier in the year, not much of an impact at all. And in the quarter, it was very little. George Kurian : Hey, I think, Jim, when we look at the business, we feel very good about our portfolio capabilities that we have today getting us to that $1 billion ARR number in fiscal year \u201825. We\u2019re not going to break out organic versus inorganic. I think, we feel that we\u2019ve achieved a full year of integration of our core acquisitions, Spot, CloudJumper and Talon. So, we feel that the core bets are in place for this year. We will continue to look at inorganic acquisitions to fill out our portfolio, right? So, we think that we have a strong start to differentiated position in the cloud market. We feel really strong about the capabilities that we have. We will tell you more about it through the course of the business, through the course of -- as we expand the cloud business. And I\u2019ll just sit on three things, right? We are growing our cloud business while growing our core business. We are acquiring a lot of net new customers. We are accelerating our organic business growth and our inorganic acquisitions. And so, I feel really, really good about our business overall. Cloud gross margins, as Mike said, are near the corporate average, and as we go through next year, will be accretive to company gross margins. So, I just feel very, very good about our opportunity in the cloud and the work that our team has been doing with the cloud providers. And we\u2019re going to double down on it. Jim Suva : Congratulations. Kris Newton : Thanks, Jim. Next question? Operator : Next question comes from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. I had a question on cash flow. I understand that you guided to over $1.1 billion and this fiscal 2022 is going to have pressure from inventory and higher CapEx. But, as you think about the model on a longer term basis, should we expect that when you don\u2019t have to buy excess inventory, we\u2019ll start to see cash flow growth that maybe more closely mirrors what you\u2019re able to do in terms of earnings, or will the increased CapEx be a drag for a longer period of time? Thank you. Mike Berry : Hey Shannon, it\u2019s Mike. So, thanks for the question on cash flow, happy to do that. So, a couple of things. If you look over the last four years, the operating cash flow results in NetApp have really mirrored the operating -- non-GAAP operating income. It\u2019s like 107% of that number. So, we do expect over time that we\u2019ll see operating cash flow mirror operating income we\u2019ll see operating cash flow mere operating income growth. Now there\u2019s -- it\u2019s going to bumper on a little bit, and I\u2019m going to do operating and then I\u2019ll take you to free cash flow. Next year, for instance, in fiscal \u201822, we would expect to see operating cash flow growth be a little bit more than earnings, just because of the working capital impact of some of the expenses in \u201821, and we\u2019ve put that in the script. From a free cash flow perspective, we really look at next year CapEx as hopefully the high watermark. A couple of pieces there. One is the -- we are certainly continuing to install hardware and some of the data centers to support the cloud business. As George talked about, we\u2019re super excited about some of the software options there as well. And as we have more software defined, that will help. Also next year in that number, there\u2019s about $50 million in CapEx related to two facilities projects, related to our Wichita site and to a lesser extent, our new building in San Jose. We obviously have a little bit of facilities CapEx, but that\u2019s a big number next year. That\u2019s why we feel comfortable going forward that we can have CapEx below the $200 million that I discussed in the script. So I just want to walk you through those puts and takes. But over time, yes, I do expect operating cash flow to pretty much near operating income with some bumping around every year largely due to working capital. Operator : The next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Ananda Baruah : Hey, guys. Yes. Congrats on the strong results. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, just going back, so George and Mike, to new sales force. Is there any -- I guess, is sort of the go-forward on that -- the incremental, is there anything meaningfully incremental that collectively those add initiatives can contribute? And not just with regard -- I mean, I know the 200 were sort of across the portfolio. So, I\u2019m really thinking in totality, not just on the cloud side, but also on the new customer side and with regards to how you were repositioning the go-to customer from a solution perspective? And that\u2019s it. Thanks. George Kurian : I think, we\u2019ll continue to be careful about where we add sales teams. I think, we constantly rebalance to areas of opportunity, both in terms of the composition of the sales force and the locations where we put the headcount. I think, as I\u2019ve said before, the recovery will be at different rates in different geographies. And I think as the public data indicates, the Americas is the place where we expect the recovery to be more pronounced this coming year, Europe lagging 6 to 9 months thereafter, and the rest of the developing economies maybe 6 to 9 months after that. So, we\u2019ll prioritize any additions in accordance with how we see the end user demand. With cloud, we have been adding, step-wise. I think one of the important things that we\u2019re focused on this year is to get our frontline sales teams to be balanced with selling cloud and our systems in customers\u2019 data centers. And so, I feel like, listen, we\u2019re not going to have a stepwise addition in our investment. We\u2019ll do it as the business comes. And we feel very good about the disciplined approach we\u2019ve taken and the payoffs for those investments in fairly short order. Ananda Baruah : And George, are the current adds -- or the adds so far, are they fully optimized at this point? George Kurian : I think on the 200 heads, as we\u2019ve said, they are fully productive, fully part of the NetApp sales team. We are adding some -- we added some cloud headcount in last quarter, we anticipate to add some more this year. Alongside the course of the business, they will take some time to get productive, but those are in the same range of productivity ramps as our traditional sales headcount. I think, what you see from this coming year from our guidance to the coming year is that revenue outpaces the growth in operating expense, leading to additional leverage in our business model. That reflects our disciplined approach to investing where we see the opportunities. Operator : Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with FIG. Mehdi Hosseini : I joined the call late. So, I apologize if I\u2019m repeating the question. I noticed your inventories are at a two-year low. And I want to see what\u2019s your strategy and how aggressive are you going to be out there buying key components, especially storage? And I have a quick follow-up. Mike Berry : Sure. Hey Mehdi, it\u2019s Mike. So, yes, we had very good inventory turns at the end of Q4. As I mentioned in the script, we -- and we\u2019ve already started and we will expect to continue a couple of different programs. One is to double down on some of the key components related to our storage products to make sure that we have enough resources. We\u2019ve always done that. And we will continue to do that. We will also add some safety stocks, so that if there are issues throughout the world, and hopefully, we\u2019re able to respond to that. In addition, we\u2019ve also -- will have longer, I\u2019ll call it, purchase orders that we will extend through the year. So, we\u2019re doing everything that we can to make sure that we have enough inventory. I would expect, in Q1, you should see those turns probably go back to the 12 to 14 number. And again, given lower cost of capital, our goal to make sure that we always have product and we could meet customer requirements, we think that\u2019s a very good investment. So, thanks for the question. Yes, you should see those inventories increase and the inventory turns go down in Q1 and likely through the rest of fiscal \u201822. Mehdi Hosseini : Great. And just a quick follow-up. Your cloud services margins is becoming accretive. But is that higher cost of component that is capping the gross margin? George Kurian : Listen, I think with regard to component costs, as Mike said, as we look out the next year, we see that the component cost in aggregate for the full year is going to be relatively flat to this year with some puts and takes in terms of the mix. I think that with regard to cloud gross margins, it\u2019s really reflecting the balance of certain regions getting more heavily utilized and seeing customer consumption of the installed footprint, while we make investments in other regions to continue to expand our business. And that trade-off between investing to continue to expand the business with the growth in ARR is the balance we walk. I think as I also mentioned, we have several other avenues to continue to drive gross margins in cloud. The software mix in the portfolio is growing with solutions like Spot and Cloud Insights and some versions of our Cloud Volumes products being software-only. The second is we continue to drive efficiency in the software, in ONTAP operating system software. So, there are lots of avenues to continue to accelerate cloud gross margins. Team has done a good job this year. And we expect it to be accretive to company gross margins as we go through next fiscal year. Operator : Our next question comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Sidney Ho : Maybe one more question on gross margin. In the past, you talked about a target to get product gross margin back to the mid-50s. You are at 54 and change already this quarter. Should we expect this gross margin to continue to improve over the next few quarters, given the mix shift towards the software heavy side products, or should we think about hardware and software margins both still have room to grow? And it sounds like higher component costs may not have an impact in the near term, but I just want to confirm that. Thanks. Mike Berry : Yes. Hey Sidney, it\u2019s Mike. We have guided in our fiscal \u201821 in our Q1 numbers, product gross margins to be relatively consistent with how we exited Q4. Again, component costs over the full year, at this point, as we sit here today, relatively flat. It will move on a little bit by quarter, but keep in mind as well, mix matters a lot in that as well. Also in Q1, we talked about 68% gross margins. Keep in mind that there\u2019s a much bigger component of revenue in Q1 that\u2019s services versus product. So you also get that bump in margin. You saw that in the last couple of Q1s as well. So, as we sit here today, we don\u2019t see a lot of movement in the gross margin numbers. Again that\u2019s based on the component costs that we see today. Mix does matter in the quarter, but we\u2019ve largely stayed relatively consistent with how we\u2019re exiting Q4. Operator : Our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets. Nehal Chokshi : Thank you. And congrats on a great quarter and great guidance. And also, thank you for the providing the extra visibility in PCS in terms of profitability with the gross margin comment, which is actually quite impressive about the scale. But, I always want more. So, my question here is, what about the operating income profitability of the PCS division? And/or maybe you can comment on where on the Rule of 40 is PCS operating at right now? Mike Berry : So, I want to make sure I understand the question. You\u2019re not talking about gross margins. You\u2019re talking about operating margins, Nehal? Nehal Chokshi : Correct, correct. And then, maybe if you want to put that into the context of Rule of 40? Mike Berry : Yes. So, at this point, as you said, you always want more. We feel good about talking about our gross margins. We\u2019re not going to go down to operating margins in that business that gets into a lot of allocations and things. So, what we\u2019re going to do is we\u2019re going to focus the business on gross margin. Do we certainly look at OpEx? And where we spend the money? Yes, we do. So, in terms of the Rule of 40, again, we have to go down the operating income. We won\u2019t do that. We will keep it at the gross margin discussion. Nehal Chokshi : In the future, do you expect to be able to break this out, or do you expect that the -- there\u2019s just too much cross-selling going on that would prevent that kind of breakout to happen? Mike Berry : What I would say is, hey, tune in after the Q1 call, and we\u2019ll talk about what we\u2019re going to disclose going in \u201822. Operator : Our last question comes from Karl Ackerman with Cowen. Karl Ackerman : Yes. Thank you. Your latest run rate all-flash array revenues are near a record of $2.9 billion and your year-over-year growth exceeded most peers. And so, I was hoping you could provide some parameters, at least qualitatively, around your fiscal \u201822 expectations for all-flash array growth, and maybe how the mix of your installed base plays into those expectations? Thank you. George Kurian : Listen, I feel really good about our flash business. We are focused, differentiated and executing in the market. I think, our strong position in the sweet spot of the storage industry, which is the midrange part of the market, is clearly evident, and it is affecting the growth rates of our competitors. We have taken share for the last several quarters, and we see every confidence that we will continue to do that going forward. What we said at the Analyst Day was that over the next few years, the all-flash array market will grow at about 7.5% CAGR, and we expect to outpace that this coming year. We expect that the storage industry will grow around 4%, and our revenue picture expects us to outpace the growth of the storage industry overall. So, we feel really good. And ONTAP 9.9 coming out gives us even more confidence in our differentiation. Kris Newton : All right. Well, thank you, Karl. That\u2019s our final question. So, I\u2019ll hand it over to George for some closing remarks. George Kurian : Thanks, Kris. In closing, we delivered a great end to a strong year. And we are well-positioned as we move into fiscal year \u201822. I want to reiterate that our public cloud business is at a scale where it is contributing meaningfully to revenue and billings growth. And the innovations we deliver to our hybrid cloud business will support continued product revenue growth. In fiscal year \u201822, we expect to grow the top line, deliver operating leverage and generate significant free cash flow, all while investing in growth initiatives. I am excited by and confident in our ability to capitalize on the industry transitions and the market opportunities ahead. I look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you for joining us. And a special thank you to our NetApp team. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and Actual results may differ materially for a variety of reasons, including macroeconomic and market conditions such as the continuing impact and uneven recovery of the COVID-19 pandemic and the capital spending environment, as well as our ability to gain share in the storage market, grow our Cloud business, and generate greater cash flow.  Please also refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC and available on our website, specifically, our most recent Form 10-K, including in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and risk factor sections.  During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are posted on our website. I'll now turn the call over to George. George Kurian : Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon. And thanks to everyone for joining our Q1 fiscal year '22 earnings call. Building on our accelerating momentum through fiscal year 21, we delivered a strong start to fiscal year 22 with results at the high-end or above our guidance for Q1. Broad-based strength drove 12% revenue growth and 16% product revenue growth year-over-year. Public cloud revenue grew triple-digits again this quarter up 155% from Q1 a year ago. Our results reflect solid customer demand and strong execution by our team in the quarter. Cloud and digital transformation initiatives remain top customer priorities, and we continue to benefit from these sizable long-term trends.  Customers need to simplify and modernize existing data centers and deploy traditional applications quickly and confidently. At the same time, customers are also accelerating their use of cloud, adopting modern application architectures like Kubernetes and micro-services for new workloads and deploying data-rich applications, like machine and deep learning. With our data fabric strategy, we are uniquely positioned to solve our customers' most significant challenges in both modern and traditional applications on-premises and in hybrid multi-cloud environments. As I've said many times, our public cloud services not only allow us to participate in the rapidly growing cloud market, they also make us a more strategic data center partner to our enterprise customers, driving share gains in our hybrid cloud business.  In Q1, we introduced our new segment reporting disclosures for hybrid cloud and public cloud, corresponding with how I look at our business. We provided financial information for both segments in our earnings materials to give you better insight into the dynamics of the 2 segments.  We will maintain our focus on driving growth with our hybrid cloud portfolio while scaling our public cloud services in fiscal year '22. In Q1, hybrid cloud revenue grew 8% year-over-year, led by outstanding growth in our All-Flash-Array business, which increased 23% to an annualized net revenue run rate of $2.8 billion. Based on our strong revenue growth, I am confident that we again gained share in the storage and all-flash markets.  In the quarter, we delivered significant innovation that advances our flexible foundation for hybrid cloud, unified data management across on-premises and cloud environments. And simplifies the consumption and operation of hybrid cloud services. We further enhance the industry's leading and only cloud-ready storage operating system by introducing ONTAP 9.9, with security enhancements, new integrated data protection capabilities, and improved stamp performance. We also released storage grid 11.5, which supports for data encryption using external key management, ransomware protection with S3 object locks, and increased performance with intelligent load balancing. And we announced a broad range of enhancements to Keystone flex subscription with new features for service providers, additional cloud support, a partner-delivered FlexPod as a service, and integration with Equinix colocation services.  Public cloud revenue grew 155% year-over-year, driven by Cloud Volumes, Cloud Insights, and Spot by NetApp. It's been a year since we acquired Spot. And we are excited by the innovation we've brought to market under the Spot by NetApp brand. And the momentum we have with the spot offerings.  Public cloud ARR grew to $337 million, an increase of 89% year-over-year and public cloud dollar-based net retention rate remains healthy at 192%. Our partnerships with the cloud providers are strong and growing. I am honored that we were recognized by Microsoft as the winner of their global customer experience partner of the year, and of their U.S. SAP on Azure Partner of the Year award. We continue to broaden our public cloud services beyond storage and data management services. Today, we have customers extend, migrate, automate, and optimize the infrastructure, and data management capabilities for enterprise and cloud-native applications. Customers use NetApp public cloud services because we enabled them to use more Cloud at less cost. In Q1, we announced Spot PC, a fully managed, secure, and cost-effective Cloud desktop as a service for Azure virtual desktop, and Windows 365.  Additionally, we acquired Data Mechanics to accelerate the roadmap for spot wave, infrastructure and application, automation and optimization platform for high-growth, big data, and machine learning workloads in the Cloud. We also continue to deliver on our vision and strategy around application-aware infrastructure and data management for containers.  Spot Ocean automates cloud infrastructure for containers, automatically scaling compute resources to maximize utilization and availability with the optimal blend of spot reserved and on-demand compute instances reducing costs by up to 90%. In Q1, we evolve Spot Ocean into a suite of DevOps solutions. with Ocean Continuous Delivery and Ocean Insights. Ocean Continuous Delivery focuses on the most painful aspects of modern application delivery by automating mission-critical deployment in verification processes. Ocean Insights is an analytical tool that gives users a full view of their application clusters and then previews the potential savings from Ocean. Last year, we introduced Astra Control, a rich set of storage and application-aware, data management services for cloud-based Kubernetes workloads. Astra extends the data fabric to the cloud-native world. And in Q1, we extended Astra to be a deployable on-premises software solution, Astra Control Center.  Wherever a customer chooses to deploy Kubernetes applications, we can accelerate the deployment, operation, and protection of these critical environments. Let me share with you a customer story to highlight the value Astra Control Center brings to enterprise customers. As a part of its transformation strategy, a leading telecommunications provider is using a modern IT architecture based on container-native applications.  These workloads are mission-critical and the customer turned to NetApp and Astra Control Center to address the challenges of data protection and disaster recovery that don't exist in the Kubernetes natively. Additionally, Astra helped them realize their vision of application portability across multiple Kubernetes distributions, and data sharing across multiple clusters. We have long been recognized for our industry-leading enterprise storage and data management technology. Our public cloud services drive further differentiation, expand our addressable market, and enable us to reach new customers. We deliver not only industry-leading storage services in the cloud, but also cloud automation and optimization services, and cloud infrastructure monitoring services.  You should expect us to capitalize on our advantage by enhancing our go-to-market activities, deepening our cloud partnerships, and delivering best-in-class, organic and inorganic innovations. Our strong customer momentum and the uniqueness of our public cloud services position furthers my confidence in our ability to reach our goal of $1 billion in public cloud ARR in fiscal year \u201825.  Our strong first-quarter results underscore our value to customers in a hybrid multi-cloud, data-driven digital world. We are confident that we are well-positioned with the right portfolio and strategy to solve our customers' most pressing challenges. With focused execution and demonstrated leadership in hybrid multi-cloud, we are reshaping the industry.  We made a number of innovation announcements this quarter, and we will continue to bring industry-leading capabilities to market, further enhancing our differentiated position in Cloud and software. I am excited for what this year will bring. And I'm confident in our ability to deliver top-line growth as we support our customers on their cloud and digital transformation journeys. Before I turn the call over to Mike to walk through our financial results and expectations, I want to thank the NetApp team, our customers, and our partners for an outstanding quarter. I also want to remind you that we'll be hosting our fully Digital Insight customer event in October. I hope you'll be able to join us. With that, I will turn it over to Mike. Mike Berry : Thank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non - GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. Fiscal '22 is off to a great start with strong revenue, gross margin, and operating leverage across the entire business. Excellent execution by the whole NetApp team yielded Q1 billings of $1.38 billion, up 20% year-over-year. Revenue came in at $1.46 billion up 12% year-over-year. Our solid Q1 results were driven by healthy demand across both our hybrid cloud and public cloud segments. Gross margin, operating margin, and EPS all came in above the high-end of guidance. As George noted in our earnings materials today, we introduced our new segment reporting disclosures for both hybrid cloud and public cloud.  Hybrid cloud captures all the revenue streams from our enterprise data center business, which include product support and professional services. Our public cloud segment provides incremental visibility into the revenue and gross margin profile of our rapidly growing Cloud business. Total hybrid cloud revenue of $1.38 billion was up 8% year-over-year. Within the hybrid cloud, we delivered product revenue growth for the second consecutive quarter, and expect this trend to continue throughout fiscal '22. Product revenue of $730 million increased 16% year-over-year. Consistent with the trends we saw throughout fiscal '21, software products revenue of $414 million increased 33% year-over-year, driven by the continued mix shift towards our All-Flash portfolio.  Totaled Q1 recurring support revenue was $578 million flat year-over-year, excluding the 14th week from last year's compare, recurring support revenue was up 8% year-over-year. As George highlighted, public cloud ARR exited one at $337 million up 89% year-over-year and 12% sequentially. Public cloud revenue recognized in the quarter was $79 million up 155% year-over-year. The growing scale of our public cloud platform continues to positively impact the overall growth profile of NetApp delivering four of the 12 points in revenue growth.  When combined, software revenue, recurring support, and public cloud revenue totaled $1.1 billion and increased 17% year-over-year, representing 73% of total revenue, versus 71% in Q1 21. Recurring support and public cloud revenue of $657 million was up 8% year-over-year, constituting 45% of total revenue. Excluding last year's 14th week from the comparison, recurring support and public cloud revenue were up a healthy 16% year-over-year. We ended Q1 with over $3.9 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 8% year-over-year.  Q1 marks the 14th consecutive quarter of year-over-year deferred revenue growth, which continues to be the best indicator of the health of our recurring revenue. The total gross margin of 69% was an all-time Company high, reflecting the value of our software portfolio and public cloud platform. The total hybrid cloud gross margin was also 69% in Q1. Within our Hybrid Cloud segment, the product gross margin was 55% and benefited from the continued mix shift towards software-rich All-Flash systems.  Our recurring support business continues to be very profitable with a gross margin of 92%. The public cloud gross margin of 71% was accretive to the overall corporate average. This is a major milestone for the public cloud business as we continue to build out a diversified portfolio of cloud-based software offerings, we expect this trend to continue as an increasing percentage of our public cloud business is built on software-only solutions.  Q1 highlighted the tremendous leverage in our operating model with an operating margin of 23%, an all-time high for our Q1. EPS of $1.15 came in above the high end of guidance and was up 58% year-over-year. Cash flow from operations was $242 million, and free cash flow was $191 million. During Q1, we repurchased $100 million in stock and paid out a $112 million in cash dividend. In total, we returned $212 million to shareholders representing 111% of free cash flow. We closed Q1 with $4.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. As you all know, the supply chain situation remains fluent. Our excellent supply chain and procurement team continues to work closely with our partner ecosystem with the goal of keeping backlog and customer lead times at a normal level. Towards this goal, we will continue to invest incremental dollars into inventory and longer-term commitments to help mitigate any potential supply risks.  Aiding this effort is the fact that we have a singular software platform that powers all of our key storage products, which provides us added flexibility to work with our contract manufacturers and customers to meet and demand. With our strong execution in Q1 and our expectation of continued growth for the remainder of the year. We are raising our fiscal '22 guidance across the board.  We now expect revenues to grow 8% to 9% year-over-year with billings growth expected to outpace revenue growth, given the continued strength and recurring support contracts and our public cloud platform. We also have growing confidence in our public cloud opportunity and are raising the low end of our fiscal 22 guides.  We now expect to exit fiscal 22 with a public cloud ARR of 450 to $500 million driven by enhanced go-to-market activities, deeper cloud partnerships, and continued product innovation. As George noted, we are solidly on track to deliver on our commitment to eclipsed $1 billion in public cloud ARR in fiscal '25. In fiscal '22, we expect the total gross margin to be approximately 68%, with a product margin of approximately 55% for the full year. We anticipate the operating margin to range between 23 to 24%.  Operating expense expectations remain unchanged at 2.75 to $2.8 billion, driven by continued investment in revenue-generating activities, including expanding our public cloud portfolio, targeted investments in go-to-market resources, and continued investment in our customer success sales team. As we discussed at our Investor Day last September, we continue to grow revenue faster than operating expenses. We are committed to delivering $4.85 to $5.05 in fiscal '22 EPS, representing 22% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Implied in this guidance is our expectation that other income and expenses will be a negative $60 million to $65 million and our effective tax rate will remain at 19%. We now expect to generate more than $1.2 billion in free cash flow in fiscal '22 as our hybrid cloud business continues to fund the growth in our public cloud platform. We are committed to the capital allocation framework we outlined during our Q4 call.  The dividend will remain the first call on capital while share repurchases will continue to play a key role in our capital allocation strategy. In fiscal '22, we expect buybacks to offset dilution from our equity plans. For modeling purposes, we expect the share count to remain flat at 229 million shares exiting fiscal 22. Consistent with NetApp's long history of discipline M and A, the remaining free cash flow generation will go towards our acquisition strategy, which will remain focused on bolstering our strategic public cloud roadmap.  Now on the Q2 guidance, we expect Q2 net revenues to range between $1.49 billion and $1.59 and $1.59 billion, which at the midpoint implies a 9% increase year-over-year. We expect the consolidated gross margin to be approximately 68% and the operating margin to be approximately 23%. assumed in this guidance, our Q2 operating expenses of 690 to $700 million. We anticipate our tax rate to be approximately 19% and we expect earnings per share for Q2 to range between $1.1 and $1.24 per share.  Assumed in our Q2 guidance is our expectation that other income and expenses will be a negative $15 million to $20 million. As a reminder, Q2 tends to be our seasonal trough for free cash flow. This is further compounded by the one-time tax payment associated with the sale of our Sunnyvale campus. In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for working tirelessly throughout Q1 to maintain the momentum we had exiting last year. We are at a unique inflection point in the Company's history as we continue to build out a truly differentiated public cloud platform while maintaining an unwavering focus on the hybrid cloud business. As a result, we are more confident than ever in our ability to deliver long-term value to our shareholders, customers, and partners as we execute against both opportunities. I'll now hand the call back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris? Kris Newton : Thanks, Mike. Let's open the call for Q&A. Please keep to just one question so we can get to as many people as possible. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Katy Huberty : Yes. Thank you. Good afternoon. Congrats on the quarter, especially the cloud profitability milestone. I have a question on the Cloud business. Last quarter you emphasized the seasonality that you expect in this business, weaker 1Q, 3Q, and stronger 2Q, 4Q seasonality. I just wanted to confirm that that would imply in your second quarter that you would expect in ARR sequential increase that's greater than what you just posted for the July quarter. And then just to add color to that, any shift in the sources of Cloud ARR and revenue in terms of your different cloud offerings or the different public cloud platforms that are driving the growth. Thank you. Mike Berry : Hey, Kate. It's Mike. Thanks for the question. I will take the first one and George will jump in on the second one. So, we would expect the same seasonality we discussed last time a little bit more in Q2 and in Q4 on a sequential basis. That's really driven by our, as you know, our bi-annual sales plan that we have now, so yes, correct. We would expect sequential to be a little bit higher in Q2. George Kurian : I think with regard to the second question, you had Katy with a mix of offerings, we feel really good about Spot by NetApp, and the work that we're doing with the hyperscalers, both especially Microsoft and Google were strong in the quarter. I think the seasonality reflected in, as we had said, reflected in the offerings that were sold by NetApp they grew nicely, but not as much as the hyperscalers than Spot did. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Ader with William Blair. Your line is open. Jason Ader : Yeah. Thank you. The first question on the public cloud growth, revenue ARR, how much of that was organic? Mike Berry : Sorry, if you -- it's Mike. If you look at the revenue growth it was a 155% year-over-year growth. If you exclude the acquisitions, then we're still very strong at about 138%. So super strong. Jason Ader : Great. And you had Spot in the numbers last year, correct? Last Q1. Mike Berry : Great question. We only had Spot for less than a month. We closed that -- Jason Ader : Less than a month, okay. Mike Berry : -- Early July, so it was very little in Q1 last year. Jason Ader : Okay. All right. So Q2 will be kind of apples-to-apples that was Spot. Mike Berry : Yeah, you're going to get a full quarter in each -- Jason Ader : Okay. Mike Berry : -- In Q2 this year. Jason Ader : All right. And then George, on the growth on the product side, how much do you think is coming from pent-up demand as the economy started to reopen here over the last several months, 6 months or so. And then what type of sustainable revenue growth do you think is reasonable? Beyond this year where you know, there are some I guess easier comps? George Kurian : And so, I think that we have never signaled of V-shaped snapback or anything like that. Our belief has been that other than a small number of customers who were directly impacted by COVID, the vast majority of the customers that we've worked with had a steady demand pattern for several quarters now, certainly, we are seeing strengthening in demand as the economies reopen.  But this is a reflection of more long-term trends, transformational work that customers are doing to digitize or hybridize their business, the work that they're doing to build cloud environments, and so on.  So, I don't think that we see this as a pent-up demand kind of model. I think with regard to the sustainability of our business, we feel really good about product revenue. We -- as we said, we think that we can sustain product revenue growth each of the quarters of this year.  And particularly our Flash segment is very, very strong. And so, we see really good momentum there. And no reason to feel anything but real good confidence about where we are. Listen, we just finished a phenomenal quarter. In Q1, we grew our all-flash business by 23% overall product revenue by 16%, and cloud by 155% year-on-year.  We raised our fiscal year to 8% to 9% growth and anticipate delivering close to $5 in earnings per share. These are all record numbers, operating margins full year, and earnings per share for the Company. I feel very, very good about where we are. Jason Ader : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Aaron Rakers : Thanks for taking the question. I guess kind of two related questions if I can. First of all, is the kind of industry we've seen a lot of evidence of component constraints and inflationary component pricing dynamics.  As you've seen that. How do you believe your customers have behaved as far as putting orders in place? How has your lead times may be changed with relation to that or has that not been a factor and you don't believe that will be a risk factor as we move forward? George Kurian : Listen, I think that components being constrained and the supply base being dynamic and fluid is something that everybody in the industry faces. Our team has done an excellent job, and the fact that we have a single operating system and a single architecture for the vast majority of our revenue gives us the flexibility to adapt and react in real-time to potential supply constraints.  Both the gross margin guide and the revenue guide that we've given anticipate puts and takes across the supply chain. With regard to our ability to manage pricing in an inflationary environment, I think the product gross margin strength in Q1 and the outlook for Q2 remains strong and is a reflection of the discipline in our field organization.  With regard to do I see customers buying up products ahead of scheduled to deal with supply constraints. I don't see that, maybe there are occasional anecdote situations. But the vast majority as we've said, it's a pretty steady and strong demand pattern across a broad range of deals. You see that in our results this quarter. Mike, do you want to add anything? Mike Berry : No, as George talked about, it's obviously very fluid. I would just give another shout-out to not only our team but obviously our partners as well for all the work that goes on, they had a really good quarter and we expect them to continue to perform and help us get through this as everybody in the industry faces. Aaron Rakers : That's perfect guys, congrats. Thanks again. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is open. Amit Daryanani : Thanks a lot, and thanks for taking my question. I just have one, I guess. George really impressive set of numbers across the board and you took up your ARR estimates for the year by 25 million at the end. I'd love to just understand what is giving you the confidence to raise the guide this early in the year? Is it better sales execution, go-to-market, or are you just seeing better adoption as a cloud company?  Just help me understand what's driving the confidence to uplift the guide for fiscal '22 on cloud services. And then Mike, relating to that, you achieved that in a gross margin number of cloud services a lot quicker than you may have had. How does the rest of the year look like from a cloud gross margin perspective? George Kurian : With regard to our confidence in the cloud business, I think we feel very, very good about the portfolio that we have. It serves a broader and broader range of used cases, both traditional applications, as well as net-new applications. Second, we are adding a lot of customers, both through NetApp pathways and particularly the hyperscaler pathways. Third, once a customer joins our platform, as you can see from our dollar-based net retention rate, they expand quite substantially with NetApp. They like the portfolio when they do a lot more with us. I think those three key fundamentals of the business drive my confidence in being able to take up the bottom of the range to this early in the year. Mike Berry : And then on the gross margin, questions are great questions. If you remember back in September Amit we talked about, there are really 4 things that we think will drive increased gross margins in the public cloud business. And it was revenue scale and we've certainly exceeded our expectations. There's increased hardware utilization.  The team's doing a wonderful job making sure as we deploy that hardware that we drive utilization. Remember as well ONTAP drives everything here at NetApp on-prem, as well as in the cloud, and we continue to see great improvements there. And the one that I think is underappreciated is more software. Keep in mind that of the 4 major products in that portfolio Cloud Volumes Services, Cloud Volumes ONTAP, Cloud Insights, and Spot, only services is \u2013 call it hardware dependent. The other three are all software Cloud offerings, and they've grown all very nicely, which has helped us get to where we are from a margin perspective. Thanks for that. And then, hey, Jason, just so I can sleep at night. I gave you 138, -- it was 135, still a very good number on the organic revenue growth if you exclude all acquisitions. Thank you for that question. Amit Daryanani : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Rod Hall : Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. I guess I will just come back to these product gross margins and just try to check. I mean, you beat your guide substantially, beat our expectations substantially for total gross margin, I should say.  But also, the product is over 2 points better than what we anticipated. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what the surprise was there. I mean, what was different and what may be what you were thinking last quarter and then I've got a follow-up on that? Mike Berry : Sure, Rob, its Mike, so I think there were two things that really drove that performance. And the first one was the large majority of which was to grow and All-Flash. And that going from, I believe it was 11% year-over-year growth last year to 23.  And you know, that comes with much better margins, more software rich, mix matters as well in that business as we've talked about in the past. The other thing that helps the percentage as well as pay -- as you know, we de-prioritized things like HCI last year. Those come in at lower margin percentages. So, you add those 2 together and that's really what drove the higher gross -- product gross margin number. Rod Hall : Okay. That's great Mike it's helped a lot. I wanted to also ask about cash flow and seasonality. I know you -- I think I heard you call out that next quarter should be a low point for cash flow and then you've given us a full-year guide on cash flow.  I'm just curious like, what is pushing all that cash flow of the backend of the year? Is it I mean, I see quite a bit of compensation accrual, but I'm just curious why the flow of cash looks the way that it does this particular year? Thanks. Mike Berry : Sure. Love cash flow questions, happy to answer those any time. In Q1, if you look at the balance, you see that accrued expenses were done significantly and that that's when a lot of variable pay gets paid in Q1.  In Q2, cash flows are largely going to follow billings growth from an aggregate perspective. Q1 from a total dollar\u2019s perspective is our lowest billings. That then flows into lower collections in Q2 as well. That's -- the other big mover there is cash taxes, and I highlighted that. Keep in mind, we'll pay about 40 million in state and federal taxes on the Sunnyvale campus.  Then in the second half, as we build billings, that's when collections go up. Every [Indiscernible] has largely relatively similar. The big movers are seasonality of collections, variable pay timing, and then cash taxes. Rod Hall : Great. And what you say is a big thing on a year-to-year, it's just that sale of the headquarters last year which positively impacted cash flow quite a bit, right? Mike Berry : That, yeah -- and keep in mind that it helped cash balances, it didn't go into operating cash flow of [Indiscernible], right. Rod Hall : Okay. Great. Thanks very much, Mike. Helpful. Mike Berry : Absolutely. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Cabral with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Matt Cabral : Yes. Thank you very much. Sounds like the demand environment continues to pick up. Curious what you're seeing from a competitive standpoint as that demand has improved, whether it's discounting your pricing and just what you're seeing in terms of the broader environment at this point. Mike Berry : I think we see, as I cited my prepared remarks, solid steady demand across all the geos. I think all of our geographies have executed extremely well to capture that demand. I feel very good about the differentiation in our offerings, both on-premises as well as in the public cloud that gives us a chance to drive value conversations with customers.  Our public cloud services clearly help our on-premises hybrid cloud business because customers see us as the only storage vendor with a cloud already operating system and that's for them to get to the public cloud. And the combination of those two is allowing us to bring on new customers and to be able to maintain and differentiated value proposition in the market. Very good execution by the team against steady solid demand across all geographies. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Samik Chatterjee : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I just had one on operating margins. You're guiding to 23 to 24 for the full year. That's about 300 basis points expansion. But if we start to look beyond this fiscal year, how should we think about headroom on margins?  I know you referred to OpEx leverage a couple of times in your prepared remarks, but just trying to think about kind of the magnitude of margin expansion beyond this fiscal year, and the drivers between gross margin and OpEx leverage. How should we think about the balance of that? George Kurian : I think overall, as we said, we continue to be a disciplined management team in the way we run the business. You should expect, as you see in the numbers this year that we should grow topline ahead of expenses, and that should create leverage in the model.  I think as Mike outlined, we wanted to get to 55 points of product gross margins in the hybrid cloud business, we have achieved that and we want to maintain that for the rest of this year. And then in terms of public cloud, we said that we wanted to get it to be accretive to the margin structure of the core business, which it is.  And we weren't -- we have expectations to continue to improve that over time towards a more SaaS-like gross margin model. Both of those elements top line as well as gross margin should allow us to be kind of creating leverage in the operating margin model of the Company. Mike, do you want to add anything? Mike Berry : No. Well, put. Those are the puts and. Samik Chatterjee : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman with Cowen. Your line is open. Karl Ackerman : Yes, thank you. Your all-flash array portfolio grew 23% off a difficult comparison, and that only gets better in the second half from a comparison standpoint. So, it seems that that's driving the bulk of your upwardly revised fiscal '22 outlook for hardware.  But I'd love to hear what you are seeing from hybrid arrays across both commercial and even SMB environments because component providers would also suggest that area is also doing well too. Thank you. George Kurian : I think hybrid arrays as we have consistently said, have a place in customer environments. There are a set of use cases we have consistently maintained that a hybrid array has a better solution to offer than an all-flash array. And so, we continue to see an opportunity for hybrid arrays to have a go-forward, enduring place. And customer\u2019s environments are hybrid array business is a strong business. We have a differentiated value proposition in hybrid, just like we do in all-flash. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Your line is open. Steven Fox : Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. George, you threw a lot at us on the public cloud side in your prepared remarks about the types of services you have today and where they're going. If we step back and you mentioned we have the near-term trends are going.  But if we step back and thought about the 2 to 3-year plan around what will be the dominant services then versus now. And what maybe isn't in the revenue base today. Can you just sort of put all of that in perspective for us, how it drives towards that $1 billion ARR target? Thank you. George Kurian : I think we are in the early innings of enterprise use of Cloud for [Indiscernible] mission-critical, business-critical application. I think we see that over the next few years, as businesses deploy more of their core operations on public clouds.  The opportunities we have around compute, automation, and management through Spot storage and data protection and management through Cloud Volumes, and monitoring through Cloud Insights will be a very, very strong business.  And all of the hyperscaler partners that we work with see it much the same way, which is why they're building more and more capabilities with us. We also see a new growth engine in the public cloud segment.  You, all the cloud-native work we're doing around containers and some are less. So, Spot Ocean be mentioned, is the same value proposition that spot brings for enterprise applications to containerized applications. That is seeing very strong adoption.  We've worked with some of the hyperscalers around Astra Control, and we're starting to see that get to wrap, especially with new cloud-native Kubernetes applications. And then we have started work on Cloud Insights for Kubernetes to bring monitoring and management. I feel very good about the portfolio. There's a lot of organic innovation and Spot has proven to be a really stellar acquisition for the Company. Steven Fox : Thanks very much. Appreciate that color. George Kurian : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nik Todorov with Longbow Research. Your line is open. Nik Todorov : Thanks, and congrats on great results, guys. George, can you give us more color on your on-prem share gains? Can you talk about which segments of the market do you see the strongest momentum there? And also, if you can comment on -- your direct sales grew faster than you\u2019re indirect for the 5th quarter in a row. Is there any particular reason for that? Thanks. George Kurian : I think with regard to where we see strength, I mean, this was a really balanced quarter across all the geographies. You can look at our results in the Americas, you look at the results in Europe and in Asia-Pacific, we grew in all the major geographies very, very nicely.  So, I feel very good about that. With regard to the direct versus indirect, I think it's a reflection of some of our largest customers who continue to buy direct, being a strong contributor to some of our all-flash array growth tried so I think that's sort of the puts and takes.  I wouldn't read anything into the specific quarter-on-quarter trends in the channel, like [Indiscernible] seek good opportunities to grow our business across both direct and indirect channels. Nik Todorov : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Your line is open. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. I just wanted to dig a little bit more into the longer-term impact from obviously the shift to cloud, now that you are breaking it out. And I understand on the gross margin side, but I'm curious if there are SG&A and R&D differentials in terms of how you would allocate or how we think about it from an OpEx perspective?  And then the same on cash flow. I know it will be lumpy depending on the investments you need to support Cloud. But longer-term, how should we think about sort of the specific shift impacting the model? Thank you. Mike Berry : I appreciate it, it's Mike. So, a couple of things as it relates to OpEx, keep in mind that the two largest operating expense lines, sales and marketing, and R&D, there's a lot of shared resources across there. Let's do R&D first, we've talked about it. We get a lot of efficiencies from the ONTAP group in terms of the work they do, both on-prem and in the cloud.  We would expect to continue that where they're focused on both of those, and we get a lot of efficiencies there. Clearly, most of the growth in that line has been focused around Cloud, and it probably still will be. That doesn't -- and that excludes any acquisitions that could certainly play into that as well.  And then from a sales and marketing perspective, we've now had at where our core sales team is selling both. And so that will continue to be a focus, but we will also add like our customer success team that we've talked about that's largely focused on the cloud business in terms of expansion and upsell and cross-sell to that team.  I think over time you'll continue to see that investment there from a cash flow perspective, I think that probably largely follows where operating income would if you're down to free cash flow, you get a little bit of difference in.  From the hardware. But we've also talked about the next couple of years will continue to see good, better hardware, especially as it relates to Azure. But over the next couple of years that will flatten out.  It's much more of a -- hey, we're adding in a certain location versus [Indiscernible] it. Once you get to almost 100% then it's more of a replacement motion. So those are the puts-and-takes around OpEx and cash flow for those 2 segments. Shannon Cross : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup. Your line is open. Jim Suva : Thank you. And the additional colors in detail were greatly appreciated. The upside for this quarter, was it due to mostly volumes or better pricing? And if the answer is both, can you kind of help us to say it was a little bit more of one versus the other. Thank you. Mike Berry : Hey, Jim, it's Mike. It was largely related to volumes. We haven't seen much of a change in external pricing for -- as we've talked about competitive environment has always been competitive, but relatively similar.  So, it's largely going to move with volumes. We saw, we didn't see much of a mixing shaft. We've talked about that in previous quarters, so it was all relatively consistent, mostly driven by buoyancy. Jim Suva : Thank you so much and congratulations and we appreciate the details. Mike Berry : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question come from the line of Louis Miscioscia with Daiwa Capital? Your line is open. Louis Miscioscia : Okay. Thank you. Hey, George, when we look back to 2018, it was a very strong year. When we get to 2022, and I'm referring to spending broadly on capital equipment for data centers. When we get to 2022 will be at the four-year anniversary.  Not necessarily looking at guidance and maybe it's obviously a little bit early to ask that question. But keep the macro and the last cycle and that we had a couple of down years and '20, can you see that enterprise and commercial customers or hopefully coming strongly back to the market in 2022? George Kurian : We have seen a steady consistent demand for our offerings and our capabilities for several quarters now. I want to just remind us that we had a strong year last year, particularly the second half of last year. And so, we continue to see that the overall demand environment is brightening steadily.  We have said from many quarters, we saw the U.S. and China leading the recovery. Europe a few months, 6 to 12 months behind that. And then the developing economies, maybe another 6 to 12 months beyond that, we continue to hold that perspective with the benefit of several quarters of experience.  And so, I feel very good. I think that we have customers who are seeing a better economic environment, starting to build confidence in spending on technology. I think within that segment, hybrid cloud, digital transformation initiatives are well-positioned and NetApp is well-positioned to go after that. Louis Miscioscia : Good. That's helpful. Thank you. Any comment on components availability and pricing obviously your margin structure has improved. So, congratulations on that. But what should we think about for the next six months there? Thank you. George Kurian : Listen, I think as Mike and I said in prepared remarks, the component supply chain is a dynamic and slowing supply chain. It is well understood in the industry. Our team has done an excellent job managing through that. We have good deep relationships with suppliers and long-term commitments with many of them.  I think as Mike and I have suggested, we will continue to use cash to buy ahead of what we need so that we can maintain supply availability. You think that's a good use of cash in the current environment. And I think that having a single operating system that drives the vast majority of our business allows us to qualify and adapt to the environment that we're in.  I want to thank our supply chain teams for continued execution and our engineering team and our partners for working with us. And I think our Sales teams have done a really good job managing through the environment to capture the value that we should for our products. Louis Miscioscia : Good luck with the rest of the year. George Kurian : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is open. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you. George, on the AFA site, can you give us an update on where you stand with respect to penetration of the installed base? And are you seeing any changes on the competitive side? And then one clarification for Mike too. George Kurian : It's 29%, so it's up another percent. As we have said, consistently, our installed base continues to grow as we acquire new customers and new workloads. And Flash is penetrating that installed base and incremental 1% to 2% at a time, right?  So, a long runway ahead on that installed base. With regard to the competitive environment, again, we don't see any sort of substantive changes. I think we have a really good offering in the market.  I think we believe we have taken a share in the environment and we're going to continue to stay focused on winning not only 30, so workloads, but also new types of workloads like Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Data lakes, and others with our all-flash portfolio. Wamsi Mohan : Okay, thanks, George. And Mike, just a clarification on these product growth margins. I heard your commentary on better software mix, also discipline in the field. But was there any contribution from either new ELAs or renewal of prior ELAs that had any impact on margins in the quarter? Mike Berry : So, thanks for the question Wamsi. So, as we've talked about, look, it's such a small piece of the business. We're not going to talk about ELAs, here's what I would point you to, and I've said it every quarter.  If you look at the financial results, specifically the amount of software and hardware revenue, you can see that in Q1 software increase, but sorted hardware, they've basically moved in lockstep the last four quarters. And if anything, if there are any large transactions that are different than our current mix, you will see it in the numbers. Wamsi Mohan : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is open. Simon Leopold : I wanted to see if you could talk a little bit about your methodology for forecasting the business, your public cloud compared to your hybrid Cloud. They're different animals, they're different maturity and I just want to understand how you're doing it and if you have some advice for the analyst community on what we can do to better enable our ability to forecast your public cloud trends. Thank you. Mike Berry : Yeah. Hey Simon, it's Mike. I'll take that one. When we look at the public cloud business, certainly it is much -- it's -- it is similar to some of the hybrid cloud dynamics, I will talk about that in a second. There are certainly new transactions that we forecast, not only coming in from the hyperscalers.  But from our sales team as well, we got pipeline reports, we see what that looks like. So, we're able to forecast that more and more, it's also renewal rates, being able to forecast renewals and then really the big driver of all cloud software businesses up-sell, cross-sell. That's, obviously difficult for you folks to see those details.  But we\u2019ve looked at all of those, certainly sales capacity as part of that on the hybrid cloud business. Keep in mind, I think it's now $2.3 billion of support revenue every year. That's much more of a renewal rate. We do look at cross-selling, upsell, and we also look at where we are in terms of pipelines and conversion rates and a big piece for us is obviously, do we have enough sales capacity?  So, I know we get a lot of questions about a net absolute go quarter-on-quarter sequentially. I would just encourage you when you look at that sequential, keep in mind, hey, the last couple of years. Have been very different than the last 10.  And it makes it -- I understand it makes it a little bit difficult, but hopefully, when we get through this COVID environment and it gets back to normal, those are more relevant, I think now it's very difficult to use those sequential growths to try to forecast the business. Simon Leopold : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Sidney Ho : Thanks for taking my question. Just a quick follow-up on the public cloud business. Obviously, you raised your target exit rate for this year, gross margin is already above the corporate average, it sounds like it's going to go higher given the software mix. You haven't talked too much about operating margins.  But should we think about this revenue stream will eventually get to above-corporate average levels. Is there a certain revenue target we should be thinking about when that happened, or is there a time element? What are some of the things that we should consider when we think about this business growth? Mike Berry : Sidney, its Mike. Just to make sure I get the -- you're talking about operating profits for the public cloud segment. That's your question? Sidney Ho : Correct. Mike Berry : Okay. Yeah. I think the best way that I would encourage you to look at that is here's the great thing about the Cloud businesses. There is a lot of good comps out there that we look at all the time. And as we look at businesses that call it 250 million in ARR, as they grow to a billion.  There, you'd see not only a slight uptick in gross margin, but then obviously you see the dynamics of operating income. So, I would encourage you to take a look at some of those comparisons. We look at that a lot in terms of benchmarking our business largely went ends up happening is they turn cash-flow positive before they turn operating income because of again, the way they recognize revenue ratable.  So, I would encourage you to. We'll take a look at those and there's really no reason to believe, as we said today, that we wouldn't follow that comparable group as we march to $1 billion in ARR. Sidney Ho : Great. Thank you. Mike Berry : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is open. Ananda Baruah : Hi, good afternoon, guys. Really appreciate you taking the question. I'd love to get your thoughts as you see. it's sort of more workloads shift to the cloud to what extent, if any, are you guys up to seeing a hardware benefit particularly and sort of like an on-prem hardware benefit as opposed to [Indiscernible] move workloads to the Cloud, particularly given your, software [Indiscernible]. Thanks a lot. George Kurian : I think with regard to the work that we're doing in the public cloud, as Mike has mentioned, and I've said before, the vast majority of our solutions are software-based. And we scale that software out using clustering so that it can go faster by going wider to more computing demand.  With regard to certain traditional applications that are more scale-up applications like an [Indiscernible] or something like that that requires a scale-up platform to support it, that's where we used hardware. And I think the software that we have can be run on generic hardware for the broad range of used cases, or our proprietary, our own hardware, for the narrow, really specific application in this case. Ananda Baruah : Okay, got it. Yeah, thank you. That's helpful. Thanks a lot. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets. Your line is open. Nehal Chokshi : Thank you. And congrats on the strong results and nice seat, increasing rate of capital we'll return to shareholders as well. My question here is that sounds like the acceleration All-Flash-Array it was behind the acceleration of software product revenues, 33% year-over-year growth. Is that correct? And then, what do you see as a sustainable growth rate in product software? Mike Berry : Yes. So, 33% increase in the software portion of product revenue. It's driven for the earlier question really by two things. One is the really nice growth in all-flash, but also less growth in HCI in some of the products that have less software and more hardware. And I would expect if going forward, if we're talking about growth in product revenue, given the continued mix shift towards All-Flash, you should expect to see software -- the software portion grow faster than the total product portion. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. Well, will 20-plus percent growth in products software be viable? Mike Berry : We're not going to guide to that other than to say it should grow faster than the total product number. Nehal Chokshi : Understood. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you Nehal. I'm going to pass it back to George for some closing remarks. George Kurian : Thanks, Kris. In closing, we delivered a great start to FY '22. And now very well positioned for continued growth throughout the year. Cloud and digital transformation initiatives. The remaining top customer priorities. And we continue to benefit from these sizable long-term trends.  Our hybrid cloud and public cloud offerings put NetApp in a unique position to address our customers' most pressing challenges. Our cloud and software intellectual property truly differentiate us. As a result, I'm more confident than ever in our ability to deliver long-term value to our shareholders, customers, and partners. Thanks for joining us. Mike Berry : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I will now like to turn the call over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Investor Relations. Kris Newton : Thank you for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Mike Berry. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com. During today\u2019s call we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for third quarter fiscal year 2022; our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability, and shareholder returns; the value we bring to customers; our ability to drive growth in our Hybrid Cloud segment and scale our Public Cloud segment; and our ability to manage through the current supply chain environment; all of which involve risk and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially for a variety of reasons, including macroeconomic and market conditions such as the continuing impact and uneven recovery of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the resulting supply chain disruptions; and the IT capital spending environment; as well as our ability to gain share in the storage market, grow our cloud business, and generate greater cash flow. Please also refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, and available on our website, specifically our most recent Forms 10-Q and 10-K including in the \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and \u201cRisk Factors\u201d sections. During the call all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are posted on our website. I will now turn the call over to George. George Kurian : Thanks, Kris and welcome everyone to our Q2 fiscal year '22 earnings call. We delivered another strong quarter, with results all at the high-end or above our guidance. Building on the momentum of last year and the previous quarter, revenue grew 11% year-over-year, with Public Cloud segment revenue growth of 85% and Hybrid Cloud segment revenue growth of 8%. Product revenue grew 9% year-over-year, the third consecutive quarter of year-over-year growth. Gross margin, operating margin, and earnings per share are all at record highs for the first half of the fiscal year. Our performance reflects continued broad-based customer demand created by the sizeable and long-term trends of cloud and data-driven digital transformation, where NetApp is playing an increasingly important role in helping customers achieve their business and hybrid cloud transformation goals. NetApp is uniquely positioned to solve organizations\u2019 most significant challenges in both modern and traditional applications, on-premises, and in hybrid, multi-cloud environments. As I\u2019ve said many times, our Public Cloud services not only allow us to participate in the rapidly growing cloud market, but they also make us a more strategic data center partner to our enterprise customers, driving share gains in our Hybrid Cloud business. We are seeing this play out in the strong results from both our Public Cloud and Hybrid Cloud segments. In Q2, we had a number of announcements that further solidify our leadership position as we continue to drive growth in our Hybrid Cloud segment, while scaling our Public Cloud segment. Public Cloud revenue grew 85% year-over-year, driven by Azure NetApp Files, Cloud Insights, and Spot by NetApp. Public Cloud ARR grew to $388 million, an increase of 80% year-over-year, and Public Cloud dollar-based net revenue retention rate remains healthy at 179%. During Q2, we advanced our cloud agenda significantly, and we remain confident in our ability to achieve our goal of reaching $1 billion ARR in fiscal year '25, with a gross margin profile that is accretive to the corporate average. In Q2, Amazon Web Services, AWS, announced the general availability of Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP, a native, fully managed AWS storage service powered by ONTAP. This new first party product is fully integrated into the AWS console and is sold, supported, run and billed by AWS, making it easy and cost effective for customers to take advantage of NetApp\u2019s suite of enterprise grade data services while running in an AWS native experience. As we saw with Azure NetApp Files, it will take time for FSx for NetApp ONTAP to ramp, but we are extraordinarily pleased with the early indicators and number of customers piloting this service. Additionally, Google Cloud announced that NetApp will provide storage infrastructure for its Google Distributed Cloud Hosted, where data resides in customer-owned data centers and co-location facilities. Google is previewing the integration of Google Cloud VMware Engine with NetApp Cloud Volumes Service, a fully managed service that helps organizations meet their needs for storage and disaster recovery. We also expanded availability of Cloud Volumes Service in the Google Cloud. Much like any other Google Cloud native service, Cloud Volumes Service can be provisioned and consumed against existing Google Cloud agreements making it easier for customers to expand their cloud engagements with both Google and NetApp. Finally, Microsoft announced that whitelisting has been removed from Azure NetApp Files. Azure NetApp Files has been generally available since May 2019 with customers around the world relying on it to run their most demanding enterprise workloads in the Azure cloud. Now customers can instantaneously leverage Azure NetApp Files to accelerate the deployment of mission-critical enterprise applications to Azure. Additionally, we expanded the backup/restore service and cross region replication capabilities for Azure NetApp Files. We now have fully integrated services with all the major public cloud providers to give organizations the benefits of our storage and data management expertise and experience no matter which cloud they choose. We have deepened each partnership and co-engineered services directly with the cloud providers, enabling their customers to buy directly from them. This level of integration streamlines purchasing, billing, operations and support and eliminates the complexity of additional contracts, product installations, or patching. Importantly for NetApp, these partnerships create a new and massive go-to-market growth engine, as three of the largest and most innovative companies in the world are reselling our technology. Each of these announcements represent years of hard work, partnership, and continuous innovation bringing ONTAP to the cloud at cloud speed and represent the opportunity for continued expansion. We are now the first and only storage environment that is natively integrated into each of the major public cloud providers. We also made significant enhancements to the Spot portfolio. We introduced Spot Security, a new product designed to keep cloud infrastructure secure. Delivering continuous, automated AI-based security, Spot Security analyzes, detects, and prioritizes threats to surface the most critical vulnerabilities and provides actionable compliance, remediation, and prevention. We also released intelligent traffic flow, a new functionality to Spot Elastigroup, which further enhances our customers\u2019 ability to optimize their applications by intelligently managing and controlling incoming network traffic for optimal instance utilization and high performance. Additionally, we announced Spot PC, a fully managed, secured, and continuously optimized desktop service built together with Microsoft to provide a complete solution for Windows 365 and Azure Virtual Desktop. At the beginning of Q3, we closed the acquisition of CloudCheckr, whose industry-leading cloud billing analytics and cloud configuration management, monitoring, and assessments solutions will augment the full suite of Spot services. In addition to being a solid technology acquisition, CloudCheckr will enhance our partner strategy for cloud, and we will leverage the CloudCheckr platform to build and extend distributor and partner businesses in both the private and public sectors. Also in Q2, we held our annual flagship customer event, Insight, with more than 10,000 attendees and we introduced NetAppTV to stay engaged with customers throughout the year. At Insight, we announced enhancements to our hybrid cloud portfolio with the latest version of ONTAP that delivers even better performance for SAN and modern workloads like AI and analytics, expanded capabilities for object storage, increasingly automated storage system management, and autonomous ransomware protection based on machine learning. The strength of our storage offerings was recognized by Gartner, which named NetApp once again as a leader in the 2021 Magic Quadrant for Primary Storage. Gartner called out our robust product and cloud service portfolio as well as Keystone Flex subscription, our comprehensive and flexible storage as a service offering. We were also recognized among this year\u2019s top vendor solutions evaluated in the 2021 Gartner Critical Capabilities for Primary Storage across all use cases. Growth in our Hybrid Cloud segment was driven by strength in Object Storage for the rapidly growing unstructured data and analytics use cases, and our All-flash array portfolio. In Q2, our All-flash array business reached a record high annualized run rate of $3.1 billion, an increase of 22% year-on-year. All-flash arrays now compose 30% of our installed base systems. We see substantial headroom to continue to help existing and new customers modernize their storage environments. Based on our continued strong revenue growth, I\u2019m confident that we once again gained share in the enterprise storage and All-flash array markets. Like everyone in our industry, we are faced with a challenging supply environment. While the situation is dynamic and continues to evolve, we are doing everything we can to mitigate the supply chain headwinds. We believe that we can continue to manage through them and address the substantial customer demand. As Mike will explain, we have factored the ongoing supply chain uncertainty into our guidance for Q3 and the full year. I am pleased with how we have navigated these challenges and want to thank our suppliers for their support and the NetApp team for their hard work in this environment. In summary, our Q2 results reflect healthy momentum, a clear vision, and exceptional execution across our business. As we close the first half of fiscal year '22, I'm proud of our team and what we have accomplished. We continue to bring industry-leading capabilities to market, further enhancing our differentiated position in cloud and software. As our customers accelerate their digital transformation and their adoption of hybrid cloud and hybrid work strategies, we believe we are well-positioned to capture the sizeable opportunity ahead. Before I turn the call over to Mike, I want to invite you all to join us for our Investor Day on March 22, 2022. Please mark your calendars and stay tuned for more information. I\u2019ll now turn it over to Mike. Mike Berry : Thank you George. Good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I\u2019ll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. Before we go through the financial details, I think it would be valuable to walk you through the key themes for today\u2019s discussion. Number 1, Q2 was another strong quarter, with results at the high-end or above our guidance; number 2, our business model continues to show significant operating leverage as we grow our operating profitability and margins; number 3, our Cloud business had another outstanding quarter as we march towards the $1 billion ARR target; and number 4, we are increasing our full year guidance for revenue, EPS and Public Cloud ARR, driven by the outperformance in Q2, the addition of CloudCheckr, and a healthy demand pipeline for the second half of our fiscal year. Now to the details. In fiscal Q2 we delivered strong revenue, gross margin, and operating leverage across the entire business. Outstanding execution by the NetApp team yielded Q2 billings of $1.55 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Revenue came in at $1.57 billion, up 11% year-over-year. Our solid Q2 results were driven by healthy demand across both our Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud segments. Gross margin, operating margin and EPS all came in above the high-end of guidance. Total Hybrid Cloud segment revenue of $1.48 billion was up 8% year-over-year. Within Hybrid Cloud, we delivered product revenue growth for the third consecutive quarter and expect this momentum to continue throughout fiscal '22. Product revenue of $814 million increased 9% year-over-year. Consistent with the trends we\u2019ve seen over the last year, software product revenue of $475 million increased 14% year-over-year, driven by the continued mix shift towards our All-flash portfolio. Total Q2 recurring support revenue of $590 million increased 7% year-over-year. As George highlighted, our All-flash revenue run rate, which includes both product and support revenue, eclipsed $3 billion for the first time in the company\u2019s history and was up 22% year-over-year. Public Cloud ARR exited Q2 at $388 million, up 80% year-over-year and 15% sequentially, driven by strong growth in Azure NetApp Files, Spot and Cloud Insights. Public Cloud revenue recognized in the quarter was $87 million, up 85% year-over-year. The growing scale of our Public Cloud platform continues to positively impact the overall growth profile of NetApp, delivering 3 of the 11 points in revenue growth. Recurring support and Public Cloud revenue of $677 million was up 13% year-over-year, constituting 43% of total revenue. When combined, software product revenue, recurring support and Public Cloud revenue totaled $1.2 billion and increased 13% year-over-year, representing 74% of total revenue, up from 72% in Q2 '21. We ended Q2 with $3.9 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 6% year-over-year. Q2 marks the 15th consecutive quarter of year-over-year deferred revenue growth, which is the best leading indicator for continued recurring revenue growth. Total gross margin was 68%, reflecting the value of our software portfolio and Public Cloud platform. Total Hybrid Cloud gross margin was also 68% in Q2. Within our Hybrid Cloud segment, product gross margin was 55% and benefited from the continued mix shift towards software-rich All-flash systems. Our recurring support business continues to be very profitable, with gross margin of 92%. Public Cloud gross margin of 71% was accretive to the overall corporate average. We expect Public Cloud gross margins to continue to trend towards our long-term goal of 75% to 80%, as an increasing percentage of our Public Cloud business will be built on software-only solutions. We recently introduced the new FSx for ONTAP product with AWS, and also closed the Cloud Checkr acquisition, both are software-only offerings and support our long-term margin goal. Q2 highlighted the tremendous leverage in our operating model, with operating margin of 24%, an all-time company high. EPS of $1.28 was up 22% year-over-year and also represented a new quarterly record for the company. Cash flow from operations was $298 million and free cash flow was $252 million. DSO in Q2 was an impressive 38 days, highlighting a strong collections process and healthy linearity throughout the quarter. Year-to-date free cash flow of $443 million is up 43% year-over-year. During Q2, we repurchased $125 million in stock and paid out $112 million in cash dividends. In total we returned $237 million to shareholders, representing 94% of free cash flow. We closed Q2 with $4.5 billion in cash and short-term investments. As you all know, the dynamic supply chain headwinds have intensified recently. Our excellent supply chain and procurement team continues to work closely with our partner ecosystem, with the goal of meeting as much customer demand as possible. Towards this goal, we will continue to invest incremental dollars into inventory and longer-term commitments. That said, we do anticipate the supply chain challenges facing the overall technology industry to impact our product revenue and product gross margins in the second half of fiscal '22. These supply chain headwinds, and our ongoing actions to mitigate them, have been factored into our Q3 and updated full year guidance. With our strong execution in Q2, the addition of CloudCheckr, and a healthy demand pipeline for the second half of our fiscal year, we are raising our fiscal '22 revenue guidance. We now expect revenues to grow 9% to 10% year-over-year, even with the challenging supply chain environment. We also have growing confidence in our expanding Public Cloud opportunity, driven by enhanced go-to-market activities, deeper and broader cloud partnerships and continued product innovation. As a result, we are raising the guidance on our organic Public Cloud ARR, with a new range of $475 million to $500 million. As you know, we closed the CloudCheckr acquisition early in Q3. We anticipate CloudCheckr to contribute an additional $35 million to $40 million in Public Cloud ARR exiting the year. In total, our new guidance for exit fiscal '22 Public Cloud ARR is $510 million to $540 million, which at the midpoint, implies a 74% increase year-over-year. For fiscal \u201822, we continue to forecast total gross margin to be approximately 68%. However, the current supply chain challenges with temporarily higher freight and expedite charges, will pressure product margins in Q3 and Q4. We now anticipate product margins to be approximately 54% for the full year. We are reaffirming our full-year operating margin guidance of 23% to 24%. We are forecasting operating expenses to range between $2.795 million and $2.815 billion, driven by investment in revenue generating activities, including expanding our Public Cloud portfolio, and investments in both our Cloud and customer success sales teams. Our new OpEx guidance also includes $10 million per quarter from CloudCheckr. As we discussed at our Investor Day last September, we remain committed to growing revenue faster than operating expenses. We are raising our fiscal \u201922 EPS guidance. We now expect EPS to range between $4.90 and $5.10, representing 23% year-over-year growth, at the mid-point. Implied in this guidance is our expectation that other income and expense will be a negative $60 million and our effective tax-rate will remain at 19%. We remain committed to delivering more than $1.2 billion in free cash flow in fiscal '22, as our Hybrid Cloud business continues to fund the growth in our Public Cloud platform. Now on to Q3 guidance. We expect Q3 net revenues to range between $1.525 billion and $1.675 billion which, at the midpoint, implies a 9% increase year-over-year. We anticipate consolidated gross margin to range between 67% and 68% and operating margin to be approximately 23%. Assumed in this guidance are Q3 operating expenses of $705 million to $715 million, which includes CloudCheckr. We expect earnings per share for Q3 to range between $1.21 and $1.31 per share. Assumed in our Q3 guidance is our expectation that other income and expense will be a negative $15 million and our tax-rate will be approximately 19%. In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for the outstanding execution in the first half of our fiscal year. The team stayed focused on our core priorities and were not distracted by external events out of their control. We are excited to build on that momentum as we continue to scale a truly differentiated Public Cloud platform, while maintaining an unwavering focus on the Hybrid Cloud business. As George mentioned, we plan to host an Investor Day in the spring, where we will further discuss the long-term value drivers for our shareholders, customers and partners. I'll now hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris? Kris Newton : Thanks Mike. Let\u2019s open the call for Q&A. Please keep to just one question so we can get to as many people as possible. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jason Ader with William Blair. Your line is open. Jason Ader : Yes, thanks. Hey, guys. I guess my question for you George is, as we think about the cloud services business, there is a lot of different elements within their just announced FSx for NetApp ONTAP, obviously, Azure NetApp Files is going well, the whole Spot business and our CloudCheckr. I guess it's hard to figure out from our perspective I think which are going to be the most important, let's call it, 3 to 5 years from now. How would you help us think about that just in terms of magnitude? And I\u2019m particular I\u2019m curious about the FSx business. I mean, how should we be thinking about how important that particular service will be to your cloud services ARR over time? George Kurian : I think, first of all, we saw strong performance this past quarter from all three important pieces of our cloud portfolio; Cloud Volumes, which is cloud storage services; Cloud Insights, which is monitoring, and our Spot portfolio, which has dynamic optimization of compute and storage in the cloud. All of them have really strong quarters and we're really pleased. In terms of FSx for ONTAP, I will just say that it's very early days. But we are extraordinarily pleased. Listen, if you look at the cloud file storage market, the public data suggests that Amazon Web Services is the dominant player in that market. And having a needed first party ONTAP Enterprise File storage service in the Amazon cloud is an enormous opportunity. We are doing the innovation and the enablement work to scale that business. We're really pleased with the early results. But we have a long, kind of, we will see that play out over the next several quarters, right? Just like Microsoft Azure NetApp files is now a really stellar product for us. Jason Ader : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Katy Huberty : Yes, thank you. Mike, you sized the profit impact of the supply chain constraints. But what is the impact to product revenue in the back half? And should we think of any shortfall in revenue just contributing to fiscal '23 growth? Mike Berry : Sure. Thanks for the question, Katy. So hey, let's put it in context a little bit, as we did the guidance for the full year. We feel really good about how Q3 in the fiscal year shaping up. Coming off a really strong Q2, we've raised the revenue growth, even with the tougher supply chain situation. And we're calling for growth across both product and cloud. As we said in the prepared remarks, we've baked all of that into our guidance, we'll work very diligently with our supply chain team, our customers, our partners to make sure we're able to fulfill as much as we can. But we're not going to break out, hey, what was the implication of supply chain? Candidly, we don't want to have two guidance numbers. We fully baked that in, as it relates to fiscal '23, we'll have to see how the second half goes, really in terms of does it continue into our fiscal '23. At what level? And how does it work its way through the rest of this fiscal year. Katy Huberty : Thank you. George Kurian : I think broadly speaking, our team has managed the environment really well. And I think if you look at the second half guidance, my expectation is you should see that continued progression of the first half trends with product and cloud services growing quickly, and our services business growing a little bit slower than that in the overall revenue mix. Katy Huberty : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Rod Hall : Yes, great. Thanks for the question. I wanted to dig back into the cloud services, George, a little bit. A couple of questions for me. One thing we've seen in the industry kind of emerging is direct hardware sales into some application in hyper scalars for low cost flash storage. And I wonder if I know that you're amortizing hardware as a service, sort of in some of these instances. But I wonder if you see an opportunity to maybe directly sell hardware into some of these things for specific applications. And I'm also curious, just strategically, I know, the question was asked earlier, what are these three services are going to be bigger? But where do you take this strategically? Can you give us some way to think about, kind of where you're taking as a service part of the business, where the opportunities lie, where you think the most opportunity is? Thanks. George Kurian : Listen, I think with regard to our approach to serve customers, together with the cloud providers, we look at a broad range of opportunities. I think they don't exist solely in the Public Cloud. I think you could see, for example, the, in my prepared remarks, the commentary on working with Google around a distributed cloud platform and so, you'll see us continue to broaden the range of innovation opportunities that we deliver with the hyper scalars so that we can truly build a hybrid multi cloud data management and infrastructure services management platform with them. I think within the public cloud, there are going to be continued opportunities for substantial growth. I think as I said, we feel really, really good about the progress towards the $1 billion ARR targets that we had laid out. We will share more about the specific updates to our long-term plans at our analysts conference, right, let but let me just say, Cloud Storage is a massive opportunity. Cloud file storage alone is a very rapidly growing multibillion opportunity. And we are positioned at the sweet spot of that alongside the biggest three cloud providers in the world. Second, cloud compute management and cloud cost management is another massively important customer priority. And Spot plus CloudCheckr gives us a differentiated platform to go after that set of use cases. And we see more and more types of workloads collapsing onto these two important elements of Infrastructure as a Service, and Cloud Insights, our monitoring platform service customers not only deploy those infrastructure services, but also monitor them. So I feel really, really, really good about our cloud progress. Rod Hall : Great, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman with Cowen. Your line is open. Karl Ackerman : Yes, thank you. I was hoping you could discuss how you plan to integrate CloudCheckr into your cloud insights and spa portfolio. And as you address that question, as you grow the cloud business toward this $1 billion target and drive gross margins in the high 70s. Should we expect a cloud business can achieve operating margins, maybe in line with the corporate average? Or could that actually happen earlier, given the go-to-market appears to be shifting to your cloud partners, rather than relying simply on your own sales force? Thanks. George Kurian : Listen, I think with regard to CloudCheckr, what spot allows customers to do is to optimize their cloud spend by dynamically deploying cloud computing and storage environments, on the most efficient platform available, right. So we addressed about 70% of the customers spend using the Spot technology. What CloudCheckr allows customers to do is to first be able to analyze and prioritize which of those environments they should move to Spot first and most quickly, so that they can get the best savings. And then subsequently, also gives them an integrated build for their entire environment now optimized with Spot. So we're excited about what CloudCheckr brings from a technology perspective. From a route to market perspective, it has a strong footprint in public sector, and in managed service providers who use it as an integrated billing and analytics platform for all of their downstream customers. And so it expands our reach into the marketplace. With regard to cloud operating margins, today, we don't break our operating margins. I would just tell you, that we are a highly leveraged operating model for the company, if you look at the first half of this year, more than 50% of total revenue growth fell to the bottom line. We see the opportunity in cloud to be a fast growing high gross margin opportunity. And we are going to invest to capture that. But we are doing so while continuing to drive the operating margin profile of the total company. So I'm excited about possibilities ahead and the continued increase in margin rich software and cloud services in our portfolio. Mike, you have anything else? Mike Berry : Yes, thanks, George. Karl, I would just add a couple things to what George said. We do benefit in a couple ways as it relates to the cloud business. One is there's a lot of synergies in R&D, because as you know, ONTAP goes across both of those. So that will help, as you call it, the operating margin, even though we don't break it out. The other thing we've talked about is yes, the route to market and the hyperscalers sales channel certainly helps. We also have our own sales team as well. They will get more and more efficient, especially as we build up that customer success team. So as we look at that $1 billion target, as we've talked about, you look at the comps that have about a $1 billion of ARR. And certainly those operating margins are very near our corporate average today. Karl Ackerman : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Your line is open. Steven Fox : Hi, good afternoon. Just one more cloud question for you, George, you talked about how you now have fully integrated services with all the cloud service providers. How do you think you start to leverage that? Can you sort of give us a roadmap for how that builds upon itself? And where you would see initial success from having that full portfolio and then maybe later success? Thanks. George Kurian : Yes, certainly, we have three ways that we drive success in the cloud business. The first is technology certification and workload expansion. So we work with the cloud providers to qualify more and more and more workloads that can be best served using our technology. An example that I cited recently is the VMware, cloud in Google, now being certified to use NetApp Cloud Volumes as the primary as a primary data store, which has enormous benefits to VMware customers of NetApp and VMware to be able to now expand to the cloud as well as new customers that want to deploy mission critical environments on the VMware Cloud, right. So that's one. Workload certifications and expansions, the second is additional regions, and enablement for the go-to-market engines. You've seen us grow the Azure NetApp files business steadily and very successfully over a period of time. Amazon and Google are behind that. But we know the recipe and we're working to scale that. And then finally, cross-selling and upselling and customer wants to get on our service. Dollar based net retention rate is a very healthy 179%. It's early days in our customer base. So over time, that should come down. But it shows that once a customer uses one of our services, they expand dramatically, and then we get to sell them a portfolio of more services. So lots of ways to grow our cloud business ahead. We're super excited. And we worked really, really hard to get here and we're going to capitalize on the opportunity. Steven Fox : Thanks for that. That's very helpful. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Your line is open. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. I want to see if you could maybe unpack a little bit of the trends you're seeing in the traditional storage market. In particular, we're seeing very strong growth from your All-flash business, which would imply that there are aspects that are declining, and at least one of your competitors seems to be suffering, some steep declines at the high-end. I'm wondering if maybe mid range and flash is encroaching on more high-end performance? And how you see the sub segments trending for NetApp? Thank you. George Kurian : Yes, absolutely. I think we have said for a long time, that mid range systems with clustering software, will cannibalize the high-end free memory business of some of our competitors. And you're seeing that play out. The mid range systems offer the sweet spot from a price performance standpoint for our customers. And with clustering, you can build enormously large environments to consolidate a range of different workloads. And we expect that trend to continue going forward, the days of the free [indiscernible] are over to be completely transparent. And so we'll continue to see that trend going on over time. With regard to how these -- within our business, All-flash arrays will have an important and growing part of the customers data center. Hybrid Flash arrays will continue to have a long-term position in the data center. So today in our installed base, for example, all flash is about a 30% of the installed base. We expect as more flash technologies come to play that number to grow to about 70% over time. I think, however, we do not subscribe to the theory that hard disk drives no longer have value, they will have enduring value for certain sets of workloads that they are built for capacity oriented workloads, backup and archival, media retention, images, things like that. So we feel good about our position in the market. We're going to stay focused and continue to execute against our All-flash array business and our object storage businesses priorities for the enterprise storage environment. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nik Todorov with Longbow Research. Your line is open. Nik Todorov : Yes, Thanks and congrats on another great quarter. Another question on the Hybrid Cloud side. It sounds to me that you're seeing accelerating demand there. So the question is, given the supply chain challenges, how much visibility do you have from a pipeline perspective? I think you talked about seeing is very strong second half. Also, are you seeing any of normal backlog at this point? And what kind of impact do you think that could have on your model in the second half and forward. Thanks. Mike Berry : Hey, Nik, it's Mike. Thanks for the question. Yes, we feel very good about the demand environment. As we look at the second half, we certainly have a much better view at this point now and pipeline going into the second half. And as we've talked about, a lot of what's baked into the guidance is really a result of supply chain. Again, we feel really good about the overall demand environment. There is -- as we look at backlog, there's really been no significant shift there. And I do also want to make sure a note, we haven't seen any what I would call unusual Poland's either, as it relates to purchasing behavior on a quarterly basis is there's always pull ins and push outs. We haven't seen anything unusual there either. So going into second half feel really good about what the pipeline looks like in the buying behavior of our customers. And hopefully that continues as we go forward into next year. Nik Todorov : Sounds great. Thanks, guys. Good luck. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup. Your line is open. Jim Suva : Thank you. George and Mike, now is hopefully society is getting back to a little bit of more normalcy post the pandemic hopefully. Can you compare and contrast, like the purchasing trends that you're seeing, pre versus post, is it longer lead times because of supply chain, you think that might be here for good or more of a push to cloud or All-flash away, I'm just kind of compare and contrast of what you saw may be pre-pandemic versus now in the discussions you're having with customers. Thank you. George Kurian : We see continuing trends for digital transformation, hybrid work and hybrid IT, those have been our long-term perspective on how business architectures and technology architectures evolve. That has certainly come sharper into focus with COVID. But they have always been part of the long-term roadmap of our customers. We have seen the acceleration of cloud-based environments for certain workloads, especially workloads, like virtual desktops, or in schools for the ability for teachers to be able to use cloud based environments to conduct classrooms, and we think those will continue on and you're going forward, as the future of work remains hybrid. Within the enterprise storage environments, we've always believed that flash will have a growing part of the customer data center, as the economics of flash and the ability to consolidate and simplify your data center environment grows. That being said, there are workloads like I've mentioned earlier in the call that will continue to stay on hard drives. And I think the big early draft to flash is now sort of stabilizing and people understand what flash is going to be used for, and understand what HDDs are going to be used for. And so we see a more steady pattern there. With regard to, lead times and transactions and things like that, as Mike mentioned, we didn't see anything unusual. We have been able to meet customers through a variety of mechanisms, digital conferences, using video conferencing mechanisms, as well as now starting to meet some customers in person. And so we expect that to continue going forward for a period of time, at least. Jim Suva : Thank you so much, and congratulations to you and your teams. George Kurian : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Long with Barclays. Your line is open. Tim Long : Thank you. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the pricing environment and strategy given, commodity moving prices and obviously inflation that you're facing on the supply chain side. Could you just talk a little bit about how you see that kind of flowing through the model over the next few quarters here? And what do you think competitors will be doing? And will there be any differentiation in how some view NetApp and some of the other -- your peer companies are going to tackle these challenges in a market where sometimes pricing is somewhat of a factor. Thank you. Mike Berry : Hey, Tim. It's Mike. So, yes, so thanks for the question. We have not seen much of a change in the pricing environment. As we've talked about before, it's still relatively rational marquee [ph] everyone's a while somebody does something to grab a customer or keep one. But that's going to certainly be an unusual event. As we've looked forward, look I won't speak for any of our competitors. I think everybody's looking at their business saying, hey, costs have gone up across the board, especially in freight component costs. We're all dealing with that. So I do expect that you will continue to hear folks talk about doing price increases. I think a lot of this depends on how long we're in this situation. Again, from a NetApp perspective, we've looked at that. We have implemented a price increase. So we do expect that to start to have an impact later in our fiscal year. I would expect to continue to see that across our competitors. But again, I don't want to speak for them. I think a lot of this depends on how long this short supply chain shortage last, and as well our component manufacturers, how they approach the market as well. Tim Long : Okay. Thank you. George Kurian : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Sidney Ho : Thanks for taking my question. I have a question on the free cash flow. So based on your full year guidance, it would imply about 60% of the full year free cash flow, what happened the second half of the fiscal year? That's below the 5 year average of color about 70%. It's definitely lower since maybe 2015. First of all, is my math right, second if so anything you would highlight that may change this cash flow seasonality? And particularly, do you expect supply constrained being a factor in terms of cash flow generation? Thanks. Mike Berry : All right. Hey, awesome, thanks for the capital question. So yes, let's talk about it and let's start at the top. We did guide for free cash flow $1.2 billion or greater, so let's do operating cash first, that would imply for your operating cash off, call it, 1.425 billion. To your point, we've already generated $540 million. So what you saw in Q2 was a record for us low DSLs. We had a great collections quarter in Q2, that did pull forward some collections into Q2. So as we look at the second half of '22, you should expect to see the seasonality as you called it be a little bit lower in the second half, because of the really strong Q2. Still getting to at least that, that $1.4 billion operating cash number. As on your question about supply chain, we have baked in an assumption that we'll continue to invest in inventory. You saw that our inventory turns went from 17 in Q1 to 13 in Q2, that was planned. We talked about that with you folks as well for the last couple of quarters. So we have baked that into our assumption. Going forward, I think you should expect to see kind of the seasonal averages return. Again, it was just in a very, very good Q2 from a collections perspective. And I wouldn't expect that to continue into the future. So again, thanks for that question. Hopefully that answers your question. Sidney Ho : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital. Your line is open. Nehal Chokshi : Yes, thanks and congrats on strong Public Cloud services. That's great to see. On the overall business, buildings did decelerate pretty materially on a year-over-year basis. Can you talk to what were the dynamics behind that? And then why do you say you feel good about the pipeline giving -- given the billings? George Kurian : Sure. So thanks, Nehal and hello. So as we talked about in Q1, billings grew by about 20%. In Q2 billings grew by about 7%. Keep in mind that so on a -- on a year-to-date basis, right around 12% to 13% growth, that number is going to jump around a little bit each quarter based on the dynamics of deferred revenue, as well as FX as well. So we calculate billings as net revenue in the quarter and then quarter-over-quarter change in deferred excluding the impact of FX in deferred. So that's going to move the numbers a little bit, there's a little bit of seasonality to that. So looking forward, we would expect to continue to see billings overall grow at or above the revenue number. And again, I would encourage you -- and take a look at the year-to-date number or the trailing 12 months. Billings will jump around a little bit based on the components of our billings, mix matters as well as seasonality. Nehal Chokshi : Got it. Great. Thank you. George Kurian : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Your line is open. Wamsi Mohan : Yes, thank you. On your guide for Q3 and Q4, maybe you can express this a little differently on the puts and takes from Q3 to Q4 trajectory. Are you expecting component issues to be resolved through Q3? And that drives better seasonality Q3 to Q4? Or is there something else like a better pipeline? For Q4, Mike, you also mentioned increased pricing as well. So maybe you could bridge Q3 to Q4, that'd be helpful. George Kurian : Q4 is the finish of our fiscal year, as you might know, we run a semi-annual plan. And so, we had a strong Q2, and we'll have a strong Q4. So that reflects the seasonality in our business, driven by our compensation planning, as well as customer buying through the year. I think with regard to margins, I'll have Mike cover that. In terms of the supply chain and the margin profile, I would just tell you, we do not expect the near-term resolution of the supply situation. What we have seen through excellent execution with our teams and our partners is that component costs for the full year are largely flat year-on-year . There are some elements of the components that are up year-on-year and others that are down year-on-year, but as we have said before, component costs are largely flat on a year-on-year basis. I think what we see is really the expedite and freight costs that are at a premium now, and that is reflected in the pricing left that we have implemented at the start of November, and which will take some time to flow through our systems. I will let Mike characterize. Mike Berry : Great. Thank you, George. And just add to that, on this specific question, Wamsi, if you go from Q3 to Q4, a couple of things to keep in mind. One is, hey, the services revenue will continue to grow, you're going to see Cloud Support, hopefully professional services that add to that quarter-on-quarter growth. As we look at Q4 versus Q3 to George's point, always want our seasonally high quarter. We're doing a lot of work not only in supply chain, but in engineering and in other things to make sure that we can deliver as much as we can in Q4. And then certainly the price increase, it'll take a little bit of time to work its way through the system. So add all those together in those. That's what added up into our guidance, our implied guide for Q3 and Q4. Wamsi Mohan : Thank you. George Kurian : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Your line is open. Amit Daryanani : Yes, perfect. Thank you and thanks for taking my question. I guess the questions is around cloud services business. George, I was just wondering how -- when you think about AWS partnership somewhat in the early stages, how would you stack that up against Azure at this time? Just anything in terms of number of pilots or the workload that you bring with AWS right now, what would you do with Azure? And then really when I think about the $1 billion roadmap that you've given us, a while back, did you envision the AWS partnership, especially how fully integrated NetApp is on the console, and the fact that AWS is proactively selling NetApp? Did you envision all this in the $1 billion roadmap? Or is this incremental to that narrative? George Kurian : Listen, I think first of all, AWS and Azure have enormous scale and reach into the customer base. These are trillion dollar corporations with enormous impact on the IT market. And we are honored to work with both of them. They have different approaches to the customer base and different ways and different strengths. And so we're excited to work with Amazon and Microsoft. I think the overall opportunity set reflects their scale in the market, right. So Amazon has massive market presence and market share. I think in the file space, they are a very large part of the files market. So the fact that we have a play with them gives us enormous scale into the file storage market. I think, we are from an execution standpoint, listen, we've learned a lot over the last few years. We know what it takes to scale a business. And we've done that in partnership with Microsoft. We continue to scale that with innovation and co-engineering and go-to-market. But we are also taking some of those lessons learned into how we can scale other services more quickly. With regard to the $1 billion plants, listen, we always believed that we would be working with multiple hyperscalars. I don't think you should assume that we were cocky enough to say that we had that in the bag. But we had that as part of our roadmap and we're honored to have the partnership with AWS. I think, as I said, I feel very, very good about where we are in our roadmap to a $1 billion. We'll tell you more about the timing and the mix and all of that when we get to Analysts Date, right, but I feel really good about where we are. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Your line is open. Ananda Baruah : Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Yes, George and Mike, I guess, nice on the business model. How do you guys think about the interplay, or the trade off maybe in a place last trade off? Now that the margins continue to expand? I think you guys are actually absorbing like 100 to 200 basis points of op origin, sort of expense, supply chain, kind of components, et cetera, which really has the margins already be in the mid 20%. If we're at 25% or so, how do you guys think about the interplay between investing and growth, investing in M&A as the margins continue to go up, seemingly towards 30%. Appreciate it. Thanks. George Kurian : So a great, great question. So as we've talked about for the last couple years is our goal is to continue to invest in the business to drive growth. Being fully cognizant of investing in operating expense and COGS at a lower rate than revenue to drive a margins. You saw an incredible really operating leverage so far this year. And if you take the midpoint of the guide, your revenue is up almost $550 million year-over-year, on a $118 million or $120 million, pick your favorite number, OpEx number. So we're continuing to drive really good scale while investing in the business. We will continue to do that going forward, very much focused not only on where we need to invest, but what does that return. That's why we're so focused on cloud as well as incremental sales and product development. So you should expect to see us continue to invest going forward. Now outside of OpEx, we've talked about it before, we will continue to be active in M&A. And we're still allocating at least 30% of our free cash flow. Plus, we have a very nice cash balance and a lot of flexibility on the balance sheet to fund acquisitions. So, yes, you should expect to see us continue to increase OpEx to drive growth, as well as be active in the M&A market. Ananda Baruah : So it sounds like opportunity to keep accelerating revenue growth, expanding margins and get bigger in M&A, the free cash flow goes up like \u2026 George Kurian : And doesn't that sound like fun? That's exactly what we're focused on. Ananda Baruah : Thanks, guys. George Kurian : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Samik Chatterjee : Hi, thanks for taking my question. I guess my question was just following up on the pricing discussion earlier. You mentioned you've taken some pricing and the flow through would take a bit of time. Just how should we think about the stickiness of those price increases? Are they as supply chain kind of eases to those price increases we have competed away? And I'm just trying to think how much for benefit can they be like the next fiscal year as they take time to flow into the P&L? Or how sticky can they be? Thank you. George Kurian : Yes, great, great questions. So as you look at the rest of this fiscal year, and I'll work it into next year, you shouldn't really expect to see much of a benefit in Q3. There's a lot of cones in flight, it takes a while for that to take effect. So we expect to start to see some of that in Q4. As we roll into '23, I think it depends on a lot of things. The earlier question on what are your competitors doing? What's the overall pricing environment? What happens with component costs and freight? I think there's a lot in that for us to be able to say, hey, we think X amount sticks. Certainly we are very disciplined around our pricing. And we want to ensure that we are doing the right things for our customers, while we are taking care of covering our costs as well. So we'll be very focused on it. We'll talk to you as we guide to next year on the impact of that. But I did want to be clear just on the impact of '22. Thank you. Mike Berry : Thank you. George Kurian : We have delivered a solid first half with great operating leverage in our business model as we grow revenues and margins. We're gaining share in the key markets of All-flash and Object Storage, while rapidly scaling our Public Cloud business. The innovation we bring to market and our unique and deep cloud partnerships, position us well to execute again, the significant opportunity ahead. We increased our full year guidance for revenue, EPS and Public Cloud ARR, driven by the outperformance in Q2, the addition of CloudCheckr and a healthy demand pipeline for the second half of our fiscal year. Thank you. I look forward to speaking with you all again next quarter and at our upcoming Investor Day in March. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. I would now like to turn the call over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Investor Relations. Kris Newton : Thank you for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian, and CFO, Mike Berry. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com. During today\u2019s call we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022; our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability, and shareholder returns; the value we bring to customers; our ability to drive continued growth in both our Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud segments; and our ability to manage through the current supply chain environment; all of which involve risk and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially for a variety of reasons, including macroeconomic and market conditions such as the continuing impact and uneven recovery of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the resulting supply chain disruptions; and the IT capital spending environment; as well as our ability to gain share in the storage market, grow our cloud business, and generate greater cash flow. Please also refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, and available on our website, specifically our most recent Forms 10-Q and 10-K including in the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Risk Factors sections. During the call all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are posted on our website. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to George. George Kurian : Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon and welcome everyone to our Q3 FY 2022 earnings call. We delivered another outstanding quarter, building on the momentum we\u2019ve had in recent periods. Demand for our solutions is strong and powered by the alignment of our differentiated technology portfolio with customer priorities. In Q3, our focused execution delivered : double-digit revenue growth, led by the impressive performance of our Public Cloud Services and All-flash array businesses; record high gross margin dollars, operating income, and earnings per share. NetApp plays a critical role in helping customers achieve their business and cloud transformation goals. I am pleased that our differentiation here continues to receive third-party validation by industry leaders, independent analysts, and existing and new customers. We were recognized by Amazon Web Services for our achievements as an AWS partner. NetApp was named the 2021 AWS Independent Software Vendor Design Partner of the Year \u2013 U.S., for the jointly engineered and natively integrated Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP service. Additionally, GigaOm called out NetApp as the only vendor with a multi-cloud strategy and execution that translates to a continuous data management plane across clouds and locations, a comprehensive enterprise-grade feature set, and flexible deployment options. We were listed as a leader in three GigaOm Radar reports : Cloud File Systems, Primary Storage for Large Enterprises, and Enterprise Scale-Out File Systems. Not only are we a leader in each category, we are the only vendor to lead in all three. This recognition spotlights the value we bring to our customers on their cloud and digital transformation journeys. Customers are also endorsing our value, creating strong demand for solutions in both our Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud segments. Growth in our Hybrid Cloud segment was driven by continued strength in object storage and All-flash arrays. Our All-flash array business hit another milestone in Q3, with a record high annualized run rate of $3.2 billion, an increase of 23% year-over-year. All-flash array penetration of our installed base ticked up another point to 31% of installed base systems, giving us substantial headroom to continue to help existing and new customers modernize their storage environments with cloud-connected flash arrays. We further enhanced our position with the introduction of the AFF A900, which delivers unified support for file, block, and object protocols, built-in data protection with cutting-edge anti-ransomware capabilities, and the high performance and resiliency required to support the most critical business workloads. Public Cloud ARR grew to $469 million, an increase of 98% year-over-year, including the benefit from the CloudCheckr acquisition which closed early in Q3. Public Cloud dollar-based net revenue retention rate remains healthy at 169%, as customers increase their usage of our public cloud services and adopt new products. The expanded market reach from our cloud partners and the broadening participation of our field sales organization has delivered outstanding performance in our Public Cloud segment this year, which puts us well ahead of our plan to achieve $1 billion in ARR in fiscal year 2025. We, uniquely, have fully integrated services with all the major public cloud providers. I am pleased with the level of engagement from our cloud partners and with the performance of our Cloud Storage services. Azure NetApp Files again grew ahead of plan; Cloud Volumes Service for Google Cloud is ramping nicely; and, while still very early days, we are seeing lots of proofs of concept and activity with AWS FSx for NetApp ONTAP. Our differentiated CloudOps portfolio for multi-cloud infrastructure management is also growing well, led by Spot and Cloud Insights. It is expanding our addressable market, and opening opportunities with new buyers at existing customers and with new customers as we help them reduce the cost and complexity of managing their rapidly growing cloud environments. We are delivering innovation at cloud speed and enhancing our solutions to address the needs of cloud natives and born-in-the-cloud applications. We've made Cloud Backup Kubernetes aware and broaden Spot Ocean with automated cloud infrastructure and application management for Apache Spark and Ocean CD, enabling faster deployment of Kubernetes applications with end-to-end visibility and management. As I mentioned earlier, we closed the CloudCheckr acquisition early in Q3. CloudCheckr complements the FinOps capabilities of Spot with the multi-cloud reports, analytics and governance needed to plan, manage and optimize cloud costs to ensure organizations get the most out of their cloud investment. We continue the rapid pace of organic and inorganic innovation with today's announcement of the acquisition of Fylamynt. Fylamynt extends our leadership in cloud operations. Adding Fylamynt's cloud automation technology to the Spot platform will make it easy for customers to integrate Spot solutions with their existing tools, processes and infrastructure code. This will accelerate their ability to take advantage of Spot's suite of capabilities for understanding and optimizing their cloud infrastructure. I'm excited to welcome the Fylamynt team to NetApp. As I've said many times, our strategy to help customers deal with the challenges of managing data and applications in hybrid multi-cloud environments is helping us expand our business by winning new customers and displacing the competition. A global third-party logistics company chose FSx for NetApp ONTAP to host data migrated from Nutanix systems in its data centers. They chose NetApp-based cloud services for our resiliency, cost efficiency and multi-protocol support. This win marks a new logo for us and has already created additional opportunity for Cloud Manager and Cloud Insights. Another new customer win came from a multinational energy infrastructure company, who chose Cloud Volumes ONTAP in Azure to migrate workloads away from on-premises Dell systems. They are now considering replacing expired Dell systems with on-premises NetApp systems to make it easier to move data across environments in the future. We had a first-time win at an international government agency with Spot Eco to optimize its multimillion-dollar cloud spend. This win becomes a lighthouse reference account for us which we can leverage to reach into other related agencies. In summary, our strong Q3 results underscore our unique position in solving organization's most significant challenges in both cloud-native and traditional applications, on-premises and in hybrid multi-cloud environments. First, we help customers simplify and modernize existing data centers and deploy traditional applications quickly and confidently. Second, we help customers adopt modern application architectures like Kubernetes and microservices for new workloads and deploy data-rich applications like machine and deep learning. And third, we help customers optimize cost, performance, availability and security for applications and associated infrastructure across multiple clouds. The complexities created by rapid data growth, multi-cloud management and the adoption of next-gen technologies creates a sizable opportunity for us with focused execution, I am confident in our ability to capture that opportunity and deliver continued growth. We're holding an Investor Day on March 22, where we'll talk more about our growth opportunity and our plans to drive shareholder value. You can register at investors.netapp.com. If you have any questions, please reach out to the IR team. Before I turn the call over to Mike to walk you through the numbers, I want to take a moment to welcome Harv Bhela to NetApp as our Chief Product Officer. Harv brings with him more than 25 years of experience building industry-defining software categories and cloud services. I also want to thank Brad Anderson for his leadership and wish him well in his retirement. With that, I'll hand it over to Mike. Mike Berry : Thank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. Before we go through the financial details, I think it would be valuable to walk you through the key themes for today's discussion. Number one, Q3 was another strong quarter, with all-time company highs in gross profit dollars, operating income and EPS as our business model continues to show significant operating leverage as we grow our operating profitability and margins. Number two, our cloud business had another outstanding quarter. We clearly are solidly ahead of our original plan to hit our $1 billion ARR target in fiscal 2025. Number three, we are prioritizing meeting as much customer demand as possible as we navigate near-term component shortages and expect revenue to continue to be constrained in Q4. And number four, we are increasing our full year guidance for revenue, EPS and Public Cloud ARR, driven by the outperformance in Q3 and a very healthy demand backdrop for Q4. Now to the details. In fiscal Q3, we delivered strong revenue, gross margin and operating leverage across the entire business. Outstanding execution by the NetApp team yielded Q3 billings of $1.76 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Revenue came in at $1.61 billion, also up 10% year-over-year. Our solid Q3 results were driven by continued strong demand across both our Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud segments. Hybrid Cloud segment revenue of $1.5 billion was up 6% year-over-year. Within Hybrid Cloud, we delivered product revenue growth for the fourth consecutive quarter and expect this momentum to continue into Q4 and throughout fiscal 2023. Product revenue of $846 million increased 9% year-over-year. Consistent with the trends we've seen over the last two quarters, software product revenue of $507 million increased 18% year-over-year, driven by the ongoing mix shift towards our all-flash portfolio. Total Q3 recurring support revenue of $586 million increased 3% year-over-year. As George highlighted, our all-flash revenue run rate, which includes both product and support revenue, eclipsed $3.2 billion for the first time in the company's history, and was up 23% year-over-year. Public Cloud ARR exited Q3 at $469 million, up 98% strong growth in Azure NetApp Files, Spot and Cloud Insights, with CloudCheckr contributing $35 million in ARR. Organic public cloud ARR, excluding $434 million in Q3, up 83% year-over-year. Public Cloud revenue recognized in the quarter was $110 million, up 100% year-over-year and 26% sequentially. The growing scale of our Public Cloud portfolio continues to positively impact the overall growth profile of NetApp, delivering four of the 10 points in revenue growth. Recurring support and Public Cloud revenue of $696 million was up 11% year-over-year, constituting 43% of total revenue. When combined, software product revenue, recurring support and Public Cloud revenue totaled $1.2 billion, another company high and increased 14% year-over-year, representing 75% of total revenue, up from 72% in Q3 2021. We ended Q3 with $4 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 4% year-over-year. Q3 marks the 16th consecutive quarter of year-over-year deferred revenue growth, which is the best leading indicator for continued recurring revenue growth. Total gross margin was 67%, reflecting the value of our software and public cloud portfolio. Total Hybrid Cloud gross margin was also 67% in Q3. Within our Hybrid Cloud segment, product gross margin was 52%, while our growing recurring support business continues to be very profitable, with gross margin of 92%. Public Cloud gross margin of 71% was accretive to the overall corporate average. As we highlighted last quarter, we expect Public Cloud gross margins to continue to trend towards our long-term goal of 75% to 80% as an increasing percentage of our Public Cloud business will be built on software solutions. The introduction of FSx for ONTAP with AWS and the addition of CloudCheckr to the Spot portfolio, both of which are software offerings, support our long-term margin goal. Q3 highlighted the tremendous leverage in our operating model with operating margin of 25%, an all-time company high. EPS of $1.44 was up 31% year-over-year and also represented a new quarterly record for the company. Cash flow from operations was $260 million, and free cash flow was $199 million. During Q3, we repurchased $125 million in stock and paid out $111 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $236 million to shareholders, representing 119% of free cash flow. We closed Q3 with $4.2 billion in cash and short-term investments. As many companies have highlighted during this earnings season, the dynamic supply chain situation continues to cause disruptions across the technology ecosystem. These headwinds were further exacerbated by Omicron. In addition to a worsening freight and expedite environment, we also experienced component supplier decommits beginning in the second half of Q3, which required us to purchase components in the open market at significant premiums. We were faced with the short-term decision of supporting the robust customer demand versus optimizing near-term product margin. NetApp has consistently focused on being a great long-term strategic partner to our loyal customer base, especially throughout the last two years of COVID. Consistent with this philosophy, we made this strategic decision to prioritize meeting customer demand with the trade-off being lower product margins in the short term. To be clear, the pricing and availability of our core HDD and SSD components are stable and are not a contributor to the near-term headwinds. With these supply chain headwinds as a backdrop, I want to highlight two critical takeaways. Number one, we believe these cost headwinds are temporary in nature; and number two, we expect that Q4 will be the trough for product margins. As you all know, \u2013 the timing of getting completely through these supply chain challenges remain fluid, but we do expect cost improvements in the coming quarters as the supply headwinds begin to ease throughout the first half of fiscal 2023. We also expect our recent price increases to help further stabilize product margins in the coming quarters. As the supply base for components and airline cargo normalize, we are confident that product margin will return to its structural level in the mid-50s particularly as our mix continues to trend towards All-flash. We do anticipate these supply chain challenges to impact our product revenue and product gross margins in Q4, the supply chain headwinds, and our ongoing actions to mitigate them, have been factored into our Q4 and updated full year guidance. We expect Q4 net revenues to range between $1.635 billion and $1.735 billion which, at the midpoint, implies an 8% increase year-over-year. We anticipate consolidated gross margin in Q4 to be approximately 64%, the near-term margin headwind is being driven by an incremental $50 million to $60 million of premiums we expect to incur in open market component purchases. Consistent with our philosophy and culture, we actively prioritized being a great strategic partner to our loyal customers, many of which have been with us for over 25 years; and feel great about the discipline and execution the NetApp team has displayed in managing through the current supply situation. We expect operating margin to be approximately 22% in Q4, which would have been closer to 25% without the recent supplier decommits. Assumed in this guidance are Q4 operating expenses of $705 million to $715 million, driven by continued investment in revenue generating activities, including expanding our Public Cloud portfolio, and investments in both our Cloud and customer success sales teams. We anticipate earnings per share for Q4 to range between $1.21 and $1.31 per share. Assumed in our Q4 guidance is our expectation that other income and expense will be a negative $15 million and our tax-rate will be approximately 18%. Our Q4 guidance implies revenue growth of approximately 10% year-over-year for fiscal 2022. We also have growing confidence in our expanding Public Cloud opportunity, driven by enhanced go-to-market activities, deeper and broader cloud partnerships and continued product innovation. As a result, we are raising the guidance on our Public Cloud ARR, with a new range of $525 million to $545 million exiting fiscal 2022. Please note that Fylamynt is a tech and talent acquisition and will not contribute any ARR in Q4. The implied forecast for total gross margin is approximately 67% for the full year. Our disciplined management of the business, despite the backdrop of supply cost headwinds, has allowed us to reaffirm our full year operating margin guidance of 23% to 24%. We are raising our fiscal 2022 EPS guidance. We now expect EPS to range between $5.07 and $5.17 representing 26% year-over-year growth, at the mid-point. In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for the outstanding execution in delivering strong Q3 results. We will continue to be disciplined and long-term minded as we manage through the temporary supply challenges to meet as much customer demand as possible. Given the current environment, George and I are incredibly proud that the team stayed focused on our strategic priorities and have collectively leaned into executing against the tremendous growth opportunity we see over the next three to five years. As George mentioned, we plan to host an Investor Day on March 22 where we will further discuss the long-term growth potential and value drivers for our shareholders, customers and partners. I\u2019ll now hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris? Kris Newton : Thanks Mike. Let\u2019s open the call for questions. Operator, let\u2019s begin the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Karl Ackerman with Cowen. You may proceed with your question. Karl Ackerman : Yes. Thank you. First question for Mike, if I may. You spoke about how revenue is constrained by component shortages in your fiscal Q4. But I wanted to better understand how that may be impacting your deferred revenue growth, which it has moderated to 4% growth. And so I was hoping you could describe in a little bit more detail why that may have slowed? And how we should think about the trajectory on a go-forward basis? Mike Berry : Sure. So hey, thanks for the question, Karl. So there\u2019s two parts of that. So the first thing is when revenue is constrained and we\u2019re not able to ship or invoice, it does not go into deferred revenue. So it does not go on the balance sheet until it\u2019s actually invoiced. So if we\u2019re not able to ship, it does not go on the balance sheet. On deferred revenue, this is a super important question; I\u2019m going to tie it also to support revenue. When you look at the year-over-year growth for the last seven quarters of total deferred revenue and total support revenue, that has averaged somewhere between, call it, 4% to 6% when you take into account the impact of FX. So to be more specific, in Q3 and Q4 of last year, Q1 of this year, we had a benefit of FX of 2 to 3 percentage points. This quarter is actually a headwind of 1 percentage point. So when you normalize deferred revenue and support revenue, and those two are going to go almost hand in hand for the FX impact, you\u2019re going to get between 4%, 5% or 6% on an annual basis for all of those. So hopefully, that answers the question. Again, if we don\u2019t ship it doesn\u2019t go into deferred and then deferred and support also have been impacted by FX and they would largely move together. Thanks for the question. Karl Ackerman : Thank you. I\u2019ll hop back in queue. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed with your question. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. Just on the supply chain impact, I wondered if you could give any sense of type of product that was impacted more. And maybe just a split between what is \u2013 kind of what you would call freight versus underlying inputs kind of difference in the headwind that you\u2019re seeing? And whether it\u2019s kind of giving you more visibility as you look into kind of the next fiscal year, whether you\u2019re seeing kind of order activity pick up as customers try to assure availability? Thanks. George Kurian : First of all, with regard to the large items in our bill of materials, meaning processors, DRAM, hard drive, solid-state storage, we have a very well-managed supply chain and have seen continued support from our leading suppliers. Most of our storage media are multi-sourced as you would expect. And we have had really good engagement from them. I think the places where we have seen supply decommits have been mostly in analog semiconductors. These are low volume \u2013 low value components that are used across a lot of our product families for things like voltage stabilization and other kinds of analog functions in those systems. So they are broad-based across our systems portfolio, and which is why we\u2019ve had to resort to, in some cases, open market purchases to offset constrained supply or supplier decommits that we saw in the middle of Q3. With regard to the logistics, as you all know, cargo airfreight has been the major source of distribution of both parts and finished products, and airfreight was impacted by Omicron. We\u2019re hopeful that we can see a steady recovery as we head into fiscal year 2023 of both parts availability and logistics constraints. And I can certainly share with you the multistep action plan that we have taken that includes engineering programs, that includes strong supplier engagement, that includes pricing uplifts and discount management as well as close customer engagement to get us through this process. Meta Marshall : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. You may proceed with your question. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes. Thank you. Mike, I got two questions. First one is for Mike. You talked about April to mark the trough in operating margin. Does that mean despite seasonal trend into Q1, July quarter, the mix will help you and we should see a margin expansion? And then on \u2013 just a quick follow-up on all-flash array, how should I think about the mix of all-flash array between on-prem or enterprise customers versus the cloud? And I\u2019m assuming that the cloud would be considered new type of customers for your all-flash array. Thank you. Mike Berry : So, hey, Mehdi, it\u2019s Mike. So if \u2013 I just want to replay back your question. And is your question, the lower operating margin in Q4, which was driven almost entirely by the premiums. And what was the question on the mix going into the July quarter? Mehdi Hosseini : Yes. I\u2019m assuming that July would follow some sort of a seasonal trend revenues down, but you would benefit from the mix so that your operating margins would rebound despite lower revenues. Mike Berry : Yes. So we haven\u2019t guided fiscal 2023 yet. We\u2019ll talk about that on the next call. What we would tell you is that we wouldn\u2019t expect any change in our seasonality from Q4 to Q1. That\u2019s been relatively consistent. The one thing I\u2019d ask you to think about as well going into Q1, and both George and I talked about it, is the growth in cloud ARR is starting to have a much bigger impact positively on revenue growth as well as gross margins, which goes to up. And so that would be the one area I would ask you to consider as you do your models for next year. And again, we\u2019ll guide Q1 on the Q4 call. Go ahead, Mehdi. Mehdi Hosseini : No, I was just going to repeat the question, diversification of all-flash array customers? George Kurian : Yes. With regard to our customer footprint, we are winning with multiple elements of our portfolio. All-flash arrays continue to be well ahead of market growth rates, which is a clear indication that we are gaining share, and we are doing that by both winning new workloads in existing customers, as well as new customers. Our cloud portfolio, as I mentioned with an example on our call, gives us strength not only in net new to NetApp customers on the Public Cloud, but also an opportunity to displace their previous suppliers in their data centers as they harmonize their cloud environment with their data center environment and our CloudOps portfolio, Spot, Cloud Insights, CloudCheckr have been a source of great new customer additions. Mehdi Hosseini : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question. Wamsi Mohan : Yes, thank you. George, I was wondering about if you could talk about the confidence in Q4 margins being a trough. What times are you seeing that is making you think that specifically? And it appears that you\u2019re not baking in headwinds from NAND and HDDs and you called out good supplier relationships there. But it seems as though some of these are running into some issues as well. And if you could comment on if those had \u2013 if those start to become headwinds, is it right to understand that that\u2019s not contemplated to create incremental margin pressure? And I have a follow-up. George Kurian : Okay. Let me take that in two parts. So let me first talk about the NAND, SSD market and then talk about the rest of the supply base, if that\u2019s all right? On the NAND side, we obviously have strong supplier relationships across the memory industry and are clearly multisource for all elements of our supply portfolio and SSDs. With regard to the recent incident impacting one of the members of that industry ecosystem, they, as you know, are not our leading supplier for SSDs. And so we feel good about the work that we\u2019ve done on our SSD base. There may be some increases in prices in SSDs, but our engineering and manufacturing team has done a super job, and we expect that for the go-forward, the total storage media cost will be flat year-on-year. So we feel good about that, offsetting certain elements of the supply base with other elements of the supply base. With regard to the broader \u2013 why do we believe product gross margins are a trough in Q4, listen, there\u2019s been a lot of work that we have undertaken to deal with the supply constraints? Clearly, we have most of the large volume items and the high dollar items in our supply base are well managed, and we do not see them impacted by the supply constraints that we have seen so far. There are certain elements of our supply base that we are dealing with, with decommits in the quarter that has required us to be in the open market. And we have engineering qualifications going on for all of the major elements to create alternate sources of supply or to engineer our way around those supply constraints. And some of those engineering solutions have reached the market and will come to market over the course of the first half of fiscal year 2023. The second \u2013 the third element is pricing and discount management. As you know, we have communicated previously that we did raise prices in the fall, and we have recently also communicated another impending price increase that takes effect this month. Those two price increases will have the primary impact later in Q4 and going through, for the most part, the benefit will be seen in fiscal year 2023. And those are all the mechanisms that cause us to feel confident that while we have been dealing with the constrained supply base, we have put in place a lot of controls to allow us to feel better about the path forward. Wamsi Mohan : Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. And if I could, Mike, just to go back on your seasonality from fiscal 4Q to fiscal 1Q comment, if I understood this right, you\u2019re taking actions in paying open market prices to mitigate the revenue impact. So are you able to \u2013 but you also noted that you do have some revenue impact in fiscal Q4 and you\u2019re \u2013 if we take George\u2019s comments here about sort of the supply chain normalization happening as you head into fiscal 2023, then why would we not see a better-than-normal seasonality in fiscal 1Q 2023 if fiscal 4Q is constrained? Thank you. Mike Berry : Yes. So thanks for the question, Wamsi. So we do \u2013 going into Q1 after Q4, assuming Q4 plays out as we expect that really all depends on the availability of supply and specific supply. And mix matters here a lot. George talked about the components affecting a lot of the products across our portfolio. So as it sits today and as we look into Q1, we would expect to see some of that flow into fiscal 2023. When that\u2019s going to hit really depends on where we are from a supply chain perspective and specific components. And again, we\u2019ll update you on the Q4 call in terms of Q1. And certainly, the backdrop is to say we feel really good about the demand environment. Timing of those are really dependent on the supply chain situation, Wamsi. Wamsi Mohan : Okay. Thank you so much. Mike Berry : You bet. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. You may proceed with your question. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Thanks for taking the question, guys. I have two as well, if I can. Just building on kind of Wamsi\u2019s question there. I guess the simple question for me is that you talk about the confidence in returning to a mid-50% product gross margin. Obviously, you\u2019re working through some things and you\u2019ve outlined kind of your expectations on storage media cost being flat. But with all of that said, do I think \u2013 should I think that gross margin on the product line returns to mid-50s in fiscal 2023? Is it second half of fiscal 2023? Any kind of framing of how you\u2019re thinking about the longevity of the pressures on that product gross margin would be helpful. Mike Berry : Hey, Aaron, it\u2019s Mike. So thanks for the question. So this is super important. So just as a context, as you look at fiscal 2023, just a couple of things for you folks to think about. We really think we executed well on the things that we can control in Q3. And we\u2019ve raised guidance and revenue ARR and EPS, largely due to the great work of the team. And we have multiple new highs. We would expect to continue to execute well going into fiscal 2023. This is, as we sit today, we\u2019re not guiding Q3, but what we would say is, hey, let\u2019s do a replay of what we have said, and I think this will help you, which is product revenue has grown for four straight quarters. We expect that to continue into next year. We\u2019ve talked about the supply chain issues. We expect to moderate as we go through the first half of fiscal 2023. So, we would hope and expect that we would get back to that mid-50s during the second half of next year. And that\u2019s really driven by the three things George talked about, the improving supply chain situation, freight and expedite and the impact of the price increase. So as you look at next year, yes, we would expect to get back sometime in the second half of the year. Hopefully, that helps you with your modeling. Again, we\u2019re not giving guidance for Q3, just as we sit today. But hopefully, that helps a lot, Aaron. Aaron Rakers : Yes, that\u2019s very helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up. You talk about the Public Cloud business, and I know that you mentioned that Google, in particular, was ramping. Could you just give us maybe a bit more context of where we\u2019re at as far as the progression of maybe both Google and Amazon at this point? And when those \u2013 how we should think about those really kicking into that Public Cloud revenue? George Kurian : I think we\u2019re pleased with all of our partnerships. Azure NetApp Files was a really strong performer this quarter as it has been for several quarters now, which demonstrates both our ability and knowledge of how to scale a hyperscaler relationship and the enormous strength and leverage that gives us once it\u2019s scaled. I would say the earliest of the three is Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP. We announced it in September, and we are very, very pleased with the level of trials and early activity. They have frankly, surpassed our expectations, but it\u2019s early in the going. And so it takes time to translate those trials into paid customers and to expand the relationships across the FSx. So, I would say we\u2019re excited, but we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do, and we know where, what that work is. And so you should expect, broadly speaking, I see FSx about 18 months behind where we saw AMS with Microsoft Azure. Google is in between. Google has \u2013 we have seen several big customer successes with Google, and we are working to expand the range of workloads and the range of use cases with them across the portfolio. Aaron Rakers : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. You may proceed with your question. Samik Chatterjee : Thanks for taking my question. I had a quick couple of questions on the Public Cloud as well and just following up on Aaron\u2019s question. I think this was one, if you can help me understand if I look at your ARR \u2013 Public Cloud ARR, you did have an increase of about $80 million or so, which looks to be an acceleration sequentially compared to how you\u2019ve done in recent quarters. How much of that is maybe attributable to CloudCheckr? And excluding that it does still look like an acceleration, so if you can get us \u2013 give us some more insight into how much of that is driven by some of the newer partnerships versus it does sound like more of the growth coming from partnerships that you initiated earlier, that would be great. And then I have a quick follow-up on Public Cloud ARR. That\u2019s good. Mike Berry : Sure. So this is Mike. I\u2019ll take the first part. So we finished cloud ARR at $469 million, as you referenced 98% growth. In that number CloudCheckr represented about $35 million of ARR. So their core organic business, about $434 million, that was a year-over-year growth of about 83% versus 80% in Q2 and 89% in Q1. So really nice growth on the organic business. And as we called out, that was really driven by Azure NetApp Files, Cloud Insights and Spot. Samik Chatterjee : George, any \u2013 sorry, any color on what\u2019s driving the application here? How much of that is coming from the earlier partnerships with Azure versus the newer partnerships with AWS? George Kurian : As Mike mentioned, the new partnerships are not material contributors yet. We are excited about the potential, but you should see that potential realized over the next few years. I think that in the past quarter, the vast majority of the acceleration comes from both new customer additions as well as when you see a really strong dollar-based net retention rate. It shows that once the customer uses one of these cloud portfolios, they expand their use quite substantially. So, I think that\u2019s where the vast majority of the progress has been. Samik Chatterjee : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. You may proceed with your question. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve talked about your order growth rates. And I just wanted to see if you could maybe help us get a better understanding of how your customers are behaving, given that we had a sense that in IT space, many customers, given the lengthening of lead times and the supply chain constraints, are putting in orders earlier. I want to confirm if you're seeing that and what kind of order growth rates you're experiencing. Thank you. George Kurian : Listen, we don't see any unusual behavior. We have close relationships with our customers. Clearly, we are monitoring, given the supply chain situation, a very, very tight inspection of our order backlog and our order pipeline. We see healthy broad-based demand but no sense of shadow demand or multiple purchases in our pipeline. So we feel good about the sort of the real demand in the business, and we're doing as much as we can to meet it. Demand, as Mike has said, is outpacing supply. Simon Leopold : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question. Rod Hall : Yeah, thanks for fitting me in. I wanted to start off with the price increases. We've seen other people in this general category of products, increasing prices by around 10%. I wonder if you guys could maybe quantify the ballpark of those price increases. And maybe comment a little bit on the stickiness of that, too. There's a difference of opinion as to whether these are going to be around to stay and will people flex prices back down as underlying costs go back down as they do. So I just wanted a comment on that, if I could get it. George Kurian : Listen, I won't give you a specific number. I'll just say your read of the industry and our participation in it is in the target range, right? So obviously, we monitor the behavior of the industry and the cost of our supply, and we take appropriate action. We've taken two actions as we mentioned earlier, one in the fall and the second one in February, and we should see the benefits of those play out over time. We have to give our customers the benefit of those orders that are already in flight. Our quotes that are in flight, you have to honor them to be a good partner to customers. But over the course of Q4 and certainly heading into the new fiscal year, you should see the benefits of that come into the business. With regard to the likely duration and so on, listen, we always trade off being a good partner to customers with the need to maintain margins in our business. It's too early for me to comment. We will continue to monitor the situation, and if we make changes, we will let you know. Rod Hall : Okay. And then I had a quick follow-up and then it's on the Public Cloud Services, we were wondering, is all of that regionally accounted for in the Americas? Or do you spread it across the regions? And then I guess more generally, after you answer that one, just comment maybe on the strength of the Americas. What's driving that? It was pretty strong this quarter. Mike Berry : Yes. So an answer to the first question is the large majority of the PCS business is generated in the Americas, to the extent that there is international business that flows through entities internationally, we would certainly report it that way. The strong results in the Americas, as you mentioned, they did have a very strong quarter. That's where we saw a lot of the strong order growth coming in. So the Americas had a good quarter, both in the Hybrid Cloud and the Public Cloud segments, Rod. Rod Hall : Okay. Great, thanks Mike. Mike Berry : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. You may proceed with your question. Steven Fox : Hi, good afternoon. Just first of all, just a clarification on some of the comments you made about the quarter just closed. Are you saying that unmet demand was entirely related to supply chain? Or was there also a further acceleration in orders? And then I had a follow-up. George Kurian : Demand, as we said, demand is outpacing supply. We've been aggressive to meet demand wherever we could. And I'll just say, our team executed really well. I think that we'll just be transparent. Demand has outpaced supply both in Q3 and we expect in Q4. Steven Fox : Okay. That's helpful. And then, George, it seems like the M&A that you've done on the Public Cloud side is starting to have a compounding effect on your growth rates. Is there any way to sort of think about how that sort of changes the view for longer-term growth in Public Cloud, given that when you first set some of these targets, you didn't have some of the capabilities you have now? And sort of how that fact layers into growth going forward? Thanks. George Kurian : I think, first of all, listen. We know we are clearly ahead of our $1 billion ARR target. We will communicate the long-term targets and our perspectives on the cloud business at our Investor Day, right? So I am really excited about the portfolio we've built. We started with cloud storage. We have natively integrated cloud storage with the world's leading cloud providers, and you are seeing the acceleration of that business. We also expanded our cloud portfolio with a strong position in cloud infrastructure management with Spot, Cloud Insights, CloudCheckr and now Fylamynt helping the entire portfolio get easily adopted by customers. And so I really do feel like we have built two strong beachheads in markets that are expanding to our overall TAM and are demonstrating the ability for us to get new customers and cross-sell and upsell them a lot of different things. So I'm really excited about our portfolio. We continue to be disciplined acquirers and manage shareholder returns, both with investing for the long-term growth of our business while returning a significant amount of free cash flow to shareholders. Steven Fox : Great. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Ader with William Blair. You may proceed with your question. Jason Ader : Yes. Thank you. So George, I understand that the supply is \u2013 sorry, the demand is outpacing the supply, but how would you characterize the demand environment right now versus, say, the last few quarters, especially for your hybrid solutions in light of what some people have talked about with some pent-up demand impact in 2021? And then just as a quick follow-up, I know you guys are not guiding for FY 2023 revenue. But Mike, any early thoughts on kind of puts and takes in terms of helping us thinking about the model for revenue in 2023? George Kurian : Listen, I think we continue to see steady broad-based demand, right? It's very solid. It's across a lot of different industries, a lot of different verticals, and they are for use cases that are headline news in the industry, digital transformation, cloud enablement, unstructured data analytics, artificial intelligence, ransomware protection. I mean these are all well-known use cases with broad secular demand. I did not believe that there was a V-shaped recovery, to be honest. I think IT departments are mature buying centers, and they buy steadily over time. I think the year-on-year compares in some cases, were exacerbated by the fact that during COVID, you saw the opposite pattern for many companies. We had a good business pattern even during COVID. So I continue to remain optimistic. Our team has executed excellently. We have gained share in every category that we have played in, and our Hybrid Cloud business has two strong growth engines in object storage and all-flash. Mike Berry : Hey, Jason, on your question \u2013 I'm sorry, did you want to add something? Jason Ader : No, go for it. Yes, go for it. Mike Berry : Okay. Great. So I'll go back over what basically Aaron's question, so we're exiting \u2013 when you look at the different revenue components, four straight quarters of growth in product. We've guided for the fifth in Q4, and we expect that to continue in 2023. On a year-to-date basis, product is up about 11%. Support, we've talked about when you normalize for FX, hey, the last seven quarters, it's been a 4%, 5%, 6% grower. And again, look hard at deferred revenue, especially short-term deferred because more than 90% of support revenue in a quarter comes off the balance sheet. The cloud ARR, again, we'll update you in March, but you can do your own forecast there. As I talked about in my script, cloud contributed four of the 10 percentage points of growth in the quarter. So it's really starting to have a meaningful impact. And then, hey, nice results in professional services, but it's pretty small. So those would be the puts and takes going into next year. The one thing to keep in mind is that's largely organic. We'll continue to obviously be disciplined acquirers, but we do look to expand our cloud portfolio next year as well. Jason Ader : Thanks very much. Good luck. George Kurian : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Nik Todorov with Longbow Research. You may proceed with your question. Nik Todorov : Yes. Thanks and good afternoon everyone. A question regarding \u2013 given all of the constraints and the price increases you guys talked about, are you seeing any changes in customer behavior in relation to whether they prefer hardware versus cloud solution? Or do you see any increase in appetite from fully managed solutions like your cloud services or maybe Keystone? George Kurian : We feel good about the ability to serve customers in all of the ways that you talked about, absolutely on target. I think we've seen \u2013 while we haven't seen any sort of radical shift in behavior, the long-term trends around cloud and the use of as a service model is broadly defined, continue to be playing out for us. Our cloud portfolio continues to be really, really strong and we are able to help customers deploy workloads very quickly on public cloud environments, if they aren't able to build and deploy an environment in their data center. Keystone also had a good quarter. It's early in the going, but we continue to see more and more vertical industry wins, more and more new customer wins and also wins across our geographic base, just like you would expect us to be focused on when managing an early business. So I feel good about both parts of the business. And then, of course, our differentiated product portfolio, as we said, we're focused on growing all-flash and object storage. We have the best operating system in the market for hybrid flash that had a good quarter. So good execution across the board. Nik Todorov : Got it. Thanks guys. Good luck. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Shannon Cross of Cross Research. Your may proceed with your question. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. Just two for me. You guided $705 million to $716 million, I think it was for OpEx last quarter and came in about $683 million. I'm just curious how you're thinking about OpEx and your ability to sort of toggle it if gross margin remains under pressure? And then if you can just talk a bit about Asia since it was about 12% of revenue, which seems low. Was there anything specific to pressure that? Thank you. Mike Berry : Sure. So Shannon, its Mike here. On OpEx, yes, we did come in a little bit below guidance. That was really driven by timing of program spend. And quite frankly, we had baked in being able to hire more folks than we were able to. So that were \u2013 those were the two big drivers. From Q3 to Q4, we've talked about it, hey; we want to make sure that we're investing in the areas that drive growth. So the increase is driven by cloud, both in sales and in product. There is some program spend that we didn't spend in Q3 that will flow into Q4. And then there's always timing around things like commissions, so that's Q4. And it's a great question on toggling OpEx. I mean, again, our view is this is temporary. It's going to work its way through to 2023. Therefore, we don't want to do anything that hamstrings the growth in the business. If something changes during 2023, we'll certainly take a look at it, but that's not our stance today. The Asia revenue drop that you saw is really driven by two things, largely supply chain and us not being able to deliver. So that was mostly supply chain related versus we were able to deliver more in the other geos, which is why you saw that year-over-year drop in revenue. Shannon Cross : Great. Thank you. Mike Berry : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim Suva with Citigroup. You may proceed with your question. Jim Suva : Thank you. I just have one question. It's probably for George or maybe Mike. But you've been very ethical, loyal and true to your customers who placed orders and agreed to the terms and contracts and commitments. When you hear these decommitments, what's the action or reaction to NetApp then strategically? Do you find alternative providers long-term? Or do the host who contracted with you who broke their promises come back and give you some concessions down the road? Or do you just kind of diverse or break the bridge and move on without them? I'm just kind of curious because you've taken the high road. And it seems like some of your suppliers have really put you in an awkward situation? George Kurian : Listen, I think these are all the conversations that we have with our supply base. We have good long-term suppliers that support the vast majority of our bond and that we manage directly. There are other components that are integrated into subassemblies in our overall systems that sometimes are \u2013 have been a part of the challenge here. There's sort of multiple discussions there, right? I think clearly, we want to understand the reasons for such a decommit. We want to understand where we are in sort of the ability for the customer \u2013 for the supplier to meet our demand profile. And then there are ways that we have worked really hard in engineering to continue to build diversity of supply across our entire bill of materials and in the cases where we don't feel like we can rely on a supplier to give us access to other suppliers. And so you'll see us continuing to work that over the next several quarters to make sure that we have all the levers at our disposal to meet demand. Jim Suva : Thank you. Thank you so much, George. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. You may proceed with your question. Ananda Baruah : Yes. Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. Yes, just a quick one for me. George, how would you describe in hybrid environments where your sweet spot is today for object storage and all-flash arrays? And do you think that changes over time as you add to the portfolio? George Kurian : I mean all-flash arrays clearly, we are the strongest vendor in the mid-range systems and mid-range is displacing traditional high-end systems. So we are in more and more and more customers winning the really high end of the market as well. So really strong broad-based distribution of our portfolio. Our hybrid flash systems have done really well in the entry market. If you look at the entry price bands growth rates, those are much more hybrid flash businesses than all-flash business. And so the combination of those two give us the ability to cover a broad range of use cases with the right form factor. With regard to object storage, it's another extension of our unstructured data portfolio. The unstructured data started out in files for the most part and increasingly, as the scale of those repositories have grown, customers are starting to use object technology to allow for management and ease of administration. Our solutions have been really, really strong. I think we're focused on that market. We have a really good cost-effective, highly scalable, centrally managed object support solution. And even in the object world, we have unique integrations with the Public Cloud that allows us to build a truly hybrid object environment, combining some parts of the environment being in customers' data centers and some parts being in true public cloud under one policy framework. Ananda Baruah : That\u2019s super. Helpful. Appreciated. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. You may proceed with your question. Amit Daryanani : Thanks for squeezing me and I apologize if this has been asked already. The first one I had was on the cloud ARR side. I think you talked about the gross margins being 71% better than corporate averages. Is there a way to think about at what point do we cross and start to see operating margins in that business that are in line to corporate averages potentially? Mike Berry : Yes. So Amit, this is Mike. So we go down in the segment reporting the gross margin. At this point, we don't have any plans to go down to operating margin. We'll continue to look at that, but we're going to report segment reporting revenue down to gross margin. Amit Daryanani : Fair enough. And then you're on these component issues that I think you and everyone has been going through these challenges now. As I think about maybe the April quarter headwinds, right, and you've talked about the gross margin issues, is there a way to think about how much of that is freight logistics versus component issues? And then is there any revenue you left on the table in April that you would call out or quantify for us? Mike Berry : So the majority of the headwinds are from components versus freight. Freight and logistics are there, but the components are a bigger piece of that. And then we won't quantify what that was from a revenue perspective, what we'd say is that's all baked into the Q4 and full year guidance that we gave. Amit Daryanani : I guess Mike the part as we get \u2013 we should have conviction that we could pick up what the revenue was left on the table in the July quarter as you are requalifying some of these products and these bottlenecks alleviate, right? Mike Berry : Yes. So there was a previous question on that. What we'd say is to the extent that we have supply available and we're able to deliver those, then they could flow into Q1. We're not guiding Q1 yet. We'll do that at the end of Q4. But that is almost entirely dependent on the supply chain situation. And mix matters here, it's super important in terms of what is the mix and what are the components. Amit Daryanani : Fair enough. Thank you very much. Mike Berry : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our last question comes from Louis Miscioscia with Daiwa. You may proceed with your question. Louis Miscioscia : Okay. So I've got four demand questions and two OpEx ones. So \u2013 but joking aside, when you look at what happened in calendar 2018 with a big hardware refresh cycle, I know you talked multiple times demand is outpacing supply. But just curious because some of my CIOs checks suggest that there is a replacement cycle coming on, maybe more in the back half of this year. And then on top of that, some of my CIO checks also suggests that with some IT workers getting back to the office or just people getting back to the office, that's also some of the growth drivers. So I know you did talk about a couple before, George, but maybe if you could extrapolate if some of these are also contributing to hopefully a good demand year for you all this calendar year. George Kurian : Yes. Listen, I think you hit the points quite accurately. I think we see the improvements in the overall sort of return to work and the impact from omicron, sort of easing through the course of the year, all things remaining the same. And we think that demand continues to be really solid, steady and broad based. And so we're excited about the year ahead. We're certainly not guiding next fiscal. We'll guide when we guide it. But as I said in my remarks, we feel very, very good about the demand picture, and we're working hard to meet it with as much supply as we can get. Louis Miscioscia : Okay, thanks. Good luck on the New Year. George Kurian : Thank you. As we wrap up, I want to leave you with three callouts, the sizable and enduring trends of cloud and data-driven digital transformation, where we at NetApp play a critical role in helping customers achieve their goals are driving broad-based customer demand for our products and services. Our embracive cloud has expanded our addressable market. The real opportunity is still in front of us. And thanks to our strong Public Cloud Services performance, we are well ahead of our plan to achieve $1 billion in ARR in fiscal year 2025. Our focused execution and effective management of temporary supply chain headwind enable us to capture our expanding opportunity and deliver operating leverage as we grow our operating profitability and margins. Thank you and I hope to see you at our Investor Day next month, where we will talk more about our long-term growth and value drivers. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. I would now like to turn the call over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Investor Relations. Kris Newton : Thank you for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Mike Berry. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for first quarter and fiscal year 2023, our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability and shareholder returns, the value we bring to customers, our ability to drive continued growth in both our Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud segments and our ability to manage through the current supply chain environment, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially for a variety of reasons, including macroeconomic and market conditions, such as the continuing impact and uneven recovery of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the resulting supply chain disruptions and the IT capital spending environment as well as our ability to gain share in the storage market, grow our Cloud business and generate greater cash flow. Please also refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC and available on our website, specifically our most recent Forms 10-Q and 10-K including in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Risk Factors sections. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are posted on our website. I'll now turn the call over to George. George Kurian : Thank you, Kris. Thanks, everyone, for joining us this afternoon. Our solid fourth quarter results cap off a strong year. We made sustained progress against our strategic goals, successfully achieving our commitment to grow the business while delivering operating leverage in fiscal 2022. We gained share in enterprise storage with strong growth in all-flash array and object storage products. We expanded our public cloud business with robust expansion of customers, ARR, innovation, and routes to market. And, most notably, we delivered record levels of gross margin dollars, operating income, and earnings per share. While the demand environment remains strong, macroeconomic uncertainty, including supply constraints, rising interest rates, inflation, and geopolitical conflict, has increased since we last spoke with you at our Investor Day in March. Navigating this complex and dynamic environment is testing our teams, and we are sharply focused on managing what is in our control. Backlog is elevated due to supply constraints, despite our excellent supply chain management helping us meet as much of the demand as possible. I want to thank our global team for their disciplined execution and agile response to changing conditions. That we achieved all-time highs for gross margin dollars, operating income, and earnings per share in the face of these headwinds demonstrates our disciplined operating management. The turbulent environment also creates challenges for our customers, raising the urgency for data driven digital and cloud transformations. We sit at the intersection of these megatrends, as the complexities created by rapid data growth, multi-cloud management, and the adoption of next-gen technologies such as AI, cloud native, and modern application and data infrastructures create a sizeable opportunity for us. At our Investor Day, we outlined our objective to deliver long-term value through sustained growth and that thesis remains unchanged. Our critical role in helping customers achieve their transformation goals underpins our strategy and drives confidence for future growth. Public Cloud ARR of $505 million grew 68% year-over-year and the Q4 dollar-based net revenue retention rate remains strong at 159%. Before I get to the many highlights of the quarter, I want to address the fact that our Public Cloud ARR came short of our expectations. Demand for our cloud storage solutions was strong in Q4. We also saw a healthy number of new customer additions across both cloud storage and cloud operations services in the quarter. Unfortunately, these tailwinds were not enough to offset the lower than expected growth created by higher churn, lower expansion rates, and sales force turnover in our cloud operations portfolio. We understand the root causes of these temporary headwinds, and, in FY 2023, our focus will be on returning these services to the growth trajectory we saw in the first three quarters of the year. We have made organizational changes to increase focus on renewal and expansion motions and will continue to refine our go-to-market activities to better address the cloud operations market. Additionally, we have refreshed the sales organization and strengthened the leadership team. We believe strongly in the sizable opportunity created by our cloud operations portfolio, where we bring differentiated enterprise capabilities to cloud infrastructure management, built on our long experience supporting a broad range of applications. Our differentiation in this space continues to receive third-party validation. Spot by NetApp was recognized as a leader and the only outperformer in GigaOm\u2019s Radar for Cloud Resource Optimization. As I noted earlier, our cloud storage services continue to perform well. Azure NetApp Files remains the standout here. Cloud Volumes Service for GCP and FSx for NetApp ONTAP also had strong growth in ARR and customer additions, albeit off small bases. We continue to deliver significant innovation to help customers get the most from their cloud storage environments. AWS announced FSx for ONTAP support for single availability zones, lowering storage costs and improving performance, as well as its inclusion in the EC2 launch wizard, streamlining the selection of FSx for ONTAP as file storage for customers creating a new compute instance. These new capabilities unlock new use cases, expanding the opportunity for FSx for ONTAP. Our cloud storage and data management services are complemented by our cloud operations infrastructure management and optimization functionality. Together, these capabilities deliver an industry-leading portfolio of multicloud infrastructure services for stateful and stateless workloads. Now we\u2019re enabling customers to deploy applications quickly, easily, and cost-effectively on that multi-cloud infrastructure for big data applications with Spark on Kubernetes, for managed desktops with Spot PC, and for open-source database, data pipeline and workflow applications with our most recent acquisition, Instaclustr. Instaclustr delivers open-source data and workflow applications as a fully managed service. Instaclustr will leverage our best-in-class infrastructure services, Cloud Volumes\u2019 storage optimization, Spot\u2019s compute optimization, and Cloud Insight\u2019s monitoring and troubleshooting \u2013 to make it easier and faster for customers to build, deploy and operate cloud applications. This will enable us to deliver more value to cloud operations teams and capture more revenue from those same buyers by delivering new services, as well as through the significant synergies with our cloud storage services. I am excited to welcome the Instaclustr team to the NetApp family. Overall, fiscal year 2022 was a good year for our cloud business. We doubled Public Cloud segment revenue from $199 million in fiscal year 2021 to $396 million in fiscal year 2022; we expanded our cloud partnerships and routes to market; introduced new, organic innovations; and we completed a number of acquisitions that position us well for the future. In the coming year, we will prioritize the integration of these services. To underscore our commitment here, we plan to slow the pace of acquisitions and reprioritize our use of cash in FY\u201923 to favor shareholder returns. Mike will provide the details in his commentary. I want to underscore that we remain convinced of the opportunity, the strength of our position and our ability to achieve $2 billion in ARR exiting fiscal year 26. Now turning to Hybrid Cloud. Demand for our Hybrid Cloud solutions remains high. Despite supply constraints that again impeded our ability to meet all customer demand, we grew product revenue 6% in the fourth quarter and 10% in fiscal year 2022. All flash array annualized revenue run rate grew 12% year-over-year to $3.2 billion. Thanks to strong unit growth in FAS hybrid arrays, all flash penetration remained flat at 31% of installed systems. In Q4 we further enhanced our position in hybrid cloud with new innovations and recognition. We updated our object storage solution with security and compliance enhancements, Google Cloud integration, and faster performance for analytics workloads. We also announced the next generation of our collaboration with Cisco, FlexPod XCS for hybrid, multichord deployments. Additionally, Business Intelligence Group recognized NetApp AI as a winner of its Artificial Intelligence Excellence Award. Looking forward, our priorities are clear. We remain focused on capturing the substantial opportunity ahead as we scale our Public Cloud services, while continue to drive growth in our Hybrid Cloud solutions. The long-term thesis we presented at our Investor Day of delivering value through sustained growth remains intact. The strong fundamentals of our business, including our alignment to customer priorities, strong balance sheet, and prudent operational management put NetApp in a position of strength. I want to underscore my confidence in our strategy, our execution, and the value we bring to all our stakeholders. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mike. Mike Berry : Thank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As a reminder, I\u2019ll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. As we look back on Fiscal 2022, I am incredibly proud of the results the team delivered in an environment with such fluid and complex supply chain challenges. We delivered billings of $6.7 billion, an increase of 13% year-over-year, and grew revenue 10% to $6.3 billion. Within our Hybrid Cloud segment, all-flash revenue grew 20% and object storage revenue grew 49%. We finished Fiscal 2022 with $505 million in Public Cloud ARR, with Public Cloud revenue growing 99% for the full year. We balanced strong growth in our key strategic areas with another year of disciplined investment delivering record operating margin of 23.7% up more than 3-points from last year, with an all-time high EPS of $5.28, up 30% year-over-year. In Q4, despite supply-constrained shipments, elevated freight and logistical expense, and component cost headwinds, we delivered solid revenue, with both gross margin and operating margin coming in above guidance. Strong execution yielded Q4 billings of $2 billion, up 16% year-over-year. Revenue came in at $1.68 billion, up 8% year-over-year, including a 2-point headwind from FX. Our solid Q4 results were driven by continued strong demand for our all-flash and object storage solutions. Our Cloud portfolio continues to positively impact the overall growth profile of NetApp delivering 3.5 of the 8 points in revenue growth. Hybrid Cloud segment revenue of $1.56 billion was up 5% year-over-year. Within Hybrid Cloud, we delivered product revenue growth for the fifth consecutive quarter and expect this momentum to continue into Fiscal 2023. Product revenue of $894 million increased 6% year-over-year. Software product revenue of $530 million increased 10% year-over-year, driven by the on-going mix shift towards our all-flash portfolio. Total Q4 recurring support revenue of $590 million increased 2% year-over-year, highlighting the health of our installed base. Public Cloud ARR exited Q4 at $505 million, up 68% year-over-year, driven by strength in Cloud Storage, led by Azure NetApp Files. Public Cloud revenue recognized in the quarter was $120 million, up 82% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. We didn\u2019t end the year as expected for Cloud ARR, but are confident that we remain well-positioned to deliver on the long-term Public Cloud opportunity. While it is not unusual for hypergrowth assets to hit air pockets along their journey, we are using this moment to learn, and continue to improve the operational rigor across the CloudOps products. Towards this goal, we are laser focused on using fiscal 2023 to strengthen our field and customer success go-to-market motion, while integrating our CloudOps product portfolio. Recurring support and public cloud revenue of $710 million was up 11% year-over-year, constituting 42% of total revenue. We ended Q4 with a record $4.2 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 6% year-over-year. Q4 marks the 17th consecutive quarter of year-over-year deferred revenue growth, which is the best leading indicator for recurring revenue growth. Total gross margin was 66% and came in solidly ahead of our guidance, reflecting better than expected product margins. Total Hybrid Cloud gross margin was 65% in Q4. Within our Hybrid Cloud segment, product gross margin was 51%, as the supply chain team did an amazing job of mitigating a portion of the component cost headwinds, and our sales team was very focused on capturing our recent price increases. Our growing recurring support business continues to be very profitable, with gross margin of 93%. Public Cloud gross margin of 68% was again accretive to the overall corporate average. The sequential decline in Public Cloud gross margin was driven by lower than expected cloud revenue and incremental CapEx investment for Azure NetApp Files, which is a healthy leading demand signal. We remain confident in our long-term Public Cloud gross margin goal of 75% to 80%, as we continue to drive scale in cloud storage and an increasing percentage of our Public Cloud business being built on software solutions. Q4 highlighted the strong leverage in our operating model, with operating margin of 23%, despite the ongoing supply chain headwinds. EPS of $1.42 was up 21% year-over-year, and even excluding a one-time tax-benefit of $0.12, represents a new Q4 record for the company. Cash flow from operations was $411 million and free cash flow was $343 million. The ongoing supply constraints resulted in shipments being pushed to the end of the quarter, leading to the highest ever accounts receivable balance of $1.2 billion exiting the year, an increase of $431 million from Q3. As a result, we expect healthy cash collections in the first half of fiscal 2023, which will be a tailwind to operating cash flow for the full year. During Q4, we repurchased $250 million in stock and paid out $111 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $361 million to shareholders, representing 105% of free cash flow. We closed Q4 with $4.1 billion in cash and short-term investments. Now to guidance. In fiscal 2023, we are guiding revenues to grow 6% to 8% year-over-year, which includes a 2 percentage point headwind from FX. In fiscal 2023, we anticipate sustained demand for and continued share gain momentum in both our all-flash and object storage solutions, which we expect to drive product revenue growth in the mid-single digits. We will also continue to grow and invest in our Public Cloud business. We expect to exit fiscal 2023 with Public Cloud ARR of $780 million to $820 million, which includes approximately $40 million from our recently closed acquisition of Instaclustr. At the ARR mid-point, we expect our Public Cloud segment to drive four-points of total company revenue growth in fiscal 2023. As George noted, we remain confident in our ability to deliver $2 billion in Public Cloud ARR exiting fiscal 2026. In fiscal 2023, we expect gross margin to range between 66% and 67%, as elevated component costs and logistical expenses from supply constraints continue to weigh on product margins. We expect first half product margins to be roughly consistent with Q4 levels. As we previously disclosed, we believe these cost headwinds are temporary in nature; and we believe that Q4 2022 is the trough for product margins. As you all know, the timing of getting completely through these supply chain challenges remains fluid, but we do expect cost improvements, coupled with our recent price increases, to be a modest tailwind to product margins as we head into the back-half of fiscal 2023. We anticipate operating margin to range between 23% and 24% for the full year, as we continue to invest in our growth initiatives, while maintaining a disciplined approach to spending. Our commitment is to again grow revenue faster than operating expenses in fiscal 2023. Moving down the P&L, we expect net interest expense to be approximately $30 million and our effective tax-rate to be in the range of 21% to 22%. Despite the considerable headwind to earnings as a result of the higher tax-rate, we are committed to delivering $5.40 to $5.60 in fiscal 2023 EPS. We expect to generate greater than $1.4 billion in operating cash flow in fiscal 2023, as we continue to drive incremental profitability in our hybrid cloud segment to fund the growth in our Public Cloud business. Free cash flow is expected to exceed $1.1 billion for the full year. Factored into the year-on-year free cash flow growth is a step-up in CapEx to approximately $250 million to $300 million. The higher CapEx forecast is being driven by three key items : one, additional capacity deployments in Azure and GCP; two, higher cloud software capitalization; and three, growing pipeline for our Keystone offering. As we've discussed before, additional capacity deployments within Azure and GCP are a healthy leading indicator for cloud storage demand. Generating over $1.1 billion in free cash flow will allow us to continue to deliver on our shareholder return commitments, while also investing in our key strategic areas. From a capital allocation perspective, we expect to hit pause on CloudOps acquisitions for the first half of fiscal 2023, as we focus on strengthening our field and customer success go-to-market motions, while integrating our CloudOps product portfolio. As a result, we plan to return 100% of fiscal 2023 free cash flow to investors through dividends and share repurchases. We expect our quarterly dividend to remain at $0.50 per share throughout fiscal 2023 with the remainder of free cash flow allocated to share repurchases. We plan to front-end load these share repurchases, with $500 million coming in the first half of the year, which will reduce share count by 2% to 3% as we go through fiscal 2023. Now on to Q1 guidance. We expect Q1 net revenues to range between $1.475 billion and $1.625 billion which, at the midpoint implies a 6% increase year-over-year. We expect consolidated gross margin to be approximately 67% and operating margin to be approximately 21%. We anticipate our tax-rate to be between 21% and 22%. And we expect earnings per share for Q1 to range between $1.05 and $1.15 per share. Assumed in our Q1 guidance is net interest expense of $10 million to $15 million and a share count of approximately 224 million. In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for the outstanding dedication, focus and hustle in delivering strong fiscal 2022 results in a very fluid environment. We remain disciplined and committed to the long-term thesis we shared with you as we continue to navigate the dynamic supply challenges to meet as much customer demand as possible. We are confident, enthusiastic and incredibly focused on our long-term strategic priorities and the tremendous growth opportunity we see over the next several years. I'll now hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris? Kris Newton : Thanks Mike. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Jim Suva : Thank you. Based upon the results and your competitors who've also reported, it looks like NetApp has been gaining significant share, which is great. Is there anything in there that we should think about that would cause us to kind of pause or downshift that like any big recent design ins or acceptances? Or on the other hand with your sales force now fully ramped in the additional CapEx and things that Mike laid out, is there actually the potential you're looking at actually up-selling or up-shifting it to even a higher share gain in the future quarters? Thank you. George Kurian : I think if you look at the dynamics of this past year, demand was strong and consistent throughout. We were gated by supply particularly in the back half of the year. That certainly was true even in Q4. We feel very good about our competitive position as we outlined at our financial Analyst Day and we continue to see cloud storage has been a really strong addition to the portfolio. The number of net new to NetApp customers meaning those that do not have our storage on premises that bought cloud storage continues to be strong. So we get to cross sell additional on premises workloads in the future. And I think with regard to the performance of our flash portfolio throughout the year and the growth of object, the second growth engine in our on premises portfolio, we feel really good. So thank you for the question, Jim. Jim Suva : Thank you and congratulations. George Kurian : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Thanks lot for taking my question. I guess George I was hoping to talk a little bit about some of the headwind that you saw on the cloud services side that impacted the AR number this quarter. I know you talked about three issues, maybe you can just elaborate on kind of what these things were and really the important part would be to understand your ability and conviction to resolve these and the timeline to resolve these. And my follow-up just related to the same question around is, when I think about the 60% growth rate you're implying on the cloud services for fiscal 2023, is there some linearity that I should be thinking about maybe the back half [Indiscernible] versus the first half that would be helpful as well? Thank you. George Kurian : I'll have Mike. Thanks for the question, Amit. I'll have Mike start walking you through the specifics. I'll talk about the remedies and then we'll come back to guidance. Mike Berry : Perfect. Thank you, George. Amit, thanks for the question. So, hey, when we talked to you folks in February and we were looking at Q4, we had raised our expectations on the strength of Q3. We had expected Q4 to be largely consistent with what we saw in Q1, Q2, and Q3. And we expected to see some continued growth in Spot and Cloud Insights. We did know that there were some significant renewals in Cloud Insights. So as we went through the quarter, especially as we got into April, we saw increased churn in cloud insights. As you know, a good bit of the sale there are helping our customers move from their OCI, they're on-prem solution to the cloud solution, and some of them are still trying to find their way there. Spot. We saw lower expansion, as you know. We see \u2013 we have seen in the first three quarters a good bit of expansion in that business as they've deployed more into the cloud and that that didn't come through as expected. And then we did see higher sales and customer success turnover especially in the Spot group. So that's what happened in CloudOps. I'll now turn it back to George and I'll come back on your question on seasonality. George Kurian : I think with regard to the remedies and the overall portfolio, listen we feel good about the customer adds across the portfolio. Cloud storage was a strong number. With regard to specifically how we're addressing the CloudOps portfolio we have refreshed the sales team, so a lot of the churn in the sales organization is behind us. We do have a newer set of members, so it'll take time to wrap them. We have brought on a new experienced leader for our Spot portfolio who led enterprise sales at Splunk. We have brought on as you might have seen a new Senior Vice President for Customer Success who was a Senior Executive at Informatica, and a leader for our renewals and customer success motion in the field who was the leader of that renewals and sales at Palo Alto. So much stronger team at the top with a focused mission around our CloudOps portfolio and driving renewals and customer success. A couple of other things that we've learned, right, we've learned that we need to integrate these acquisitions more quickly, particularly on the go-to market side and we are taking that lesson learned and applying that to our Instaclustr acquisition, as well as the work that we're doing to integrate the product portfolio more quickly, so that it's easier for customers to buy. Now, I'll have it back to Mike to talk about how that impacts guidance for next year. Mike Berry : Thank you, George. So Amit, on the numbers, I just want to walk that for you. So we ended the year in total ARR at $505 million. The midpoint of guidance is $800 million that does include $40 million from Instaclustr. So let's do the organic business first $505 million to $760 million at the midpoint, which implies about a 50% growth during the year. And then you add the $40 million exiting the year from Instaclustr that gets you to the $800 million. Hey as we go through the year, we feel really good about several drivers of growth that we should start to see accelerate as we go through fiscal 2023. Number one, we have added a good bit of sales capacity. You see it in the OpEx numbers, not only in 2022, but we will in the first half of 2023. We are excited about the ramp of FSx for on \u2013 FSx on-tap as well as GCP as we go through the year and have those become more meaningful contributors. As I talked about in my prepared remarks, we continue to invest a lot in the capacity for A&F specifically, and then a smaller pieces just as we resolve some of the items we talked about with CloudOps we think that that'll help the second half. So you should expect to see acceleration as we go through the year into the second half, and we feel really good about the $760 million number. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. Thank you very much for the clarity. Mike Berry : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess George, in relation to your public cloud sort of the air pocket that you're seeing, it does look like you're implying that most of the headwinds have stemmed from a go to market sort of execution. Just wanted to sort of maybe ask for a bit more color there of what gives you confidence it's just a go-to-market approach, you have to sort of the decision to stop acquisitions, what gives you the clarity at this point that it's not a sort of additional services that you need to add to round out the portfolio. Sort of what's giving you that clarity it\u2019s just a go-to-market execution at this point? And I have a quick follow-up for Mike. Thank you. George Kurian : We saw strong adoption of our services. I think, as we mentioned in prepared remarks, a strong number of customer additions. I think the places where we can do a better job is really customer success and cross-sell and upsell, which is work that's in front of us. I think that also requires some integration work in the product portfolio to make it easier for the sales organization to do that cross-sell and upsell. Some of that integration work is completed. Others is in process, and you will see us integrating Instaclustr quickly into the NetApp portfolio, so that it can take advantage of all of our differentiated infrastructure services, Storage, Spot, Cloud Insights on we can hit the ground running pretty quickly with all of that differentiated platform behind them. So I would say within the quarter, it was mostly go-to-market execution. I think to aid the go-to-market team, we also have work to do on the product side, which we're accelerating and trying to accelerate the integration of Instaclustr into NetApp. Samik Chatterjee : Got it. Okay. And Mike, just a quick follow-up on gross margin sort of trajectory through the year. Is the improvement that you're implying sort of as you get into the back half, is that just more a function of the Public Cloud margins improving as you scale those revenues? Or are you expecting a similar improvement in Hybrid Cloud? And how much of that has to do with sort of pricing actions coming more materially through the P&L? Mike Berry : Yes. Thanks for the question, Samik. So it's both of those. And let's take Hybrid Cloud first. So we do expect the margins, the product margins in Hybrid Cloud in the first half to be relatively consistent with Q4. We did say, hey, we thought Q4 was a trough. We still feel that way as we go through the year and then seeing some expansion in the back half driven by both the pricing actions that we took as well as all the work that's going on around supply chain, so both of those go into that number. And then from a Public Cloud perspective, there are several drivers of that increased gross margin that we've talked about; a) scaling that business as A&F scales and utilizes those assets better, more software and growth in that business. So it's both of those that will add to the margin and that breaks out apart. You'll also see when you go through the numbers; a) the cloud gross margins are starting to be a pretty significant contributor to the growth as we go into 2023 and beyond. So thank you for the question. Samik Chatterjee : Thanks Mike. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Bala Reddy : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. This is Bala Reddy on for Rod. I want to start with price increases. So it looks like they're starting to kick in. And from memory, I remember the price increases, magnitude is to the tune of high single digits or maybe 10% or in that range. Given this price increase, I'm wondering why wouldn't product revenues grow more than mid-single digit in fiscal 2023. Maybe there is an element of cautiousness in that guide, given the current macro uncertainty. I just thought you would help us understand a little bit better for us. George Kurian : First of all, customers buy in dollars. And so whether we raise prices or not, their budgets are determined in dollars. And so if we raise prices, they'll buy fewer systems for the same dollars, right? I think that's the first. I think the second is, listen, we feel good about \u2013 really good about the work that our supply chain team has been doing on a year. We've had two successive quarters where we've been gated by supply rather than demand. We see a steady demand picture next year, this coming year, and we're just being realistic about how fast the supply chain constraint is. So buying in dollars and supply chain continue to be work in progress for us through the course of the year. Bala Reddy : That helps, George. And just to make sure I get it. So you're not really baking in but any macro slowdown or anything in the back half of the year or at just more a function of supply chain shortages? George Kurian : At the moment, we see demand to be steady and we are gated by supply. And so yes, we understand the economic environment is uncertain. We're managing what we can control. Our demand outlook has so far been really solid and we're gated by supply. Bala Reddy : That's helpful. And a quick follow-up, if I may. Looking at Americas commercial mix, revenue mix in the quarter, it looks like it's only flat quarter-over-quarter, whereas it's typically up in Q4. And on the other hand, Asia Pacific has done really well in the quarter. I'm just wondering, are you seeing any kind of divergence or more of a magnitude \u2013 more of a function of allocating supply to different places? Mike Berry : Yes. Hi, Bala. It's Mike. So it's really the supply chain gaining that revenue generation. And it varies by geo in terms of the product. So no significant changes from a geo perspective those what you see there is really supply chain gaining that rev. Bala Reddy : Got it. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. You guys noted some success in hiring new sales reps during the quarter. Just wanted to get a sense of whether that was more backfilling or whether you've had some success on some of the hiring for the higher-level solution sales like or sales execs that can help with the cross-sell and upsell. And then maybe just kind of on the second point around the \u2013 replacing some of the sales execs that have left, just what do you see as the ramping time line for some of the new hires to productivity? Thanks. George Kurian : I think the majority of our investment is focused on new sales reps with cloud backgrounds. We call them cloud sales specialists. So the types of execs, Meta, that you mentioned that know how to sell some of our application portfolio and cloud ops portfolio. So that's the majority. We also have had to replace some attrition in our frontline sales teams as well. And we continue to manage through that as a normal sort of course of business, right? I think the specific areas that we saw higher than anticipated attrition were really in our cloud ops portfolio. And I think we've done a good job sort of refreshing the team and also bringing on the new leadership team. I think when you look at the ramp time, it takes a few quarters, and that's why I think there's already been activity underway. We see that there will be some improvements through the first half. And then certainly, in the second half of the year, we should see the team being fully productive. In addition, given the ramp of our cloud business and the expectations of the ramp, we are continuing to invest in additional capacity, for example, in Cloud Storage and other areas. We will, of course, in line with our disciplined operating management philosophy, we don't see the growth tap on the brakes, but right now we feel that's a good investment to make. Meta Marshall : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Nik Todorov with Longbow Research. Please go ahead. Nik Todorov : Yes, thanks. And congrats on strong results, particularly given supply chain headwinds. Georg, a question maybe. I'm just curious, how have the conversations been over the last especially couple weeks when you talk with customers regarding their IT budgets in this environment? I think clearly there is a lot of headwinds like you talked in macro, and supply chain, and inflation, but there has been some recent third party surveys showing that budgets for IT are actually ticking up, not down and even if inflation pressure kind of persists. So just curious, what is the feedback that you're getting from CIOs and CFOs on those discussions for around the IT budgets? Thanks. George Kurian : I think IT is continuing to be seen, as we've said, a spur for the transformation of the business. And so there are the strategic projects around customer experience, transformation, business process automation, a variety of those projects, better analytics continue to move forward. AI/ML projects, for example, we had a strong year and continue to see a strong outlook for that part of our business. So, so far as we've said the demand picture has been steady and we recognize that there is increased uncertainty, but I think so far the demand picture for IT spending within our customer base has remain steady. Nik Todorov : Okay, great. And if I can follow-up Mike on the price increases, I just want to understand, do you envision incremental price increases, especially if you see further cost pressures through the year, or you think that you've kind of front loaded, the price increases and you just need to realize those as the year progresses? Mike Berry : Yes, so thanks Nik. My answer to that would be, we are intently focused on realizing the ones that we, we put in place we're still working through those. So at this point, that's our focus we'll see what the rest of the year holds. Never say never, but our focus right now, Nik is realizing those other two price increases. Nik Todorov : Go it. Thanks guys. Good luck. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Sidney Ho : Thanks for taking my question. In terms of your billings, obviously very strong billings with over $2 billion for the quarter. It's always strong in the second half of the fiscal year, and that's also the case this past year. Are there any trends within the billings that you would highlight that suggest may be customers are putting in orders longer than they did historically because of maybe some concerns of supply constraints? Maybe just ask differently how do you monitor the health of these billings? Thanks. Mike Berry : Hey Sidney it's Mike. So, great question. So thank you. So in Q4, we saw billings growth of 16%. As you know, billings is revenue plus change in deferred. Largely on a quarterly basis when you see billings and revenue come in differently, it's going to be driven by the timing of support, not only on point-of-sale, but also renewals. And that's exactly what happened in Q4. Keep in mind that a lot of our initial transactions will come with three years of maintenance. So you will get some variability on when those renew. So if you bifurcate the 16%, about 12% of that growth came through support renewals. And thankfully a lot of that was in software support. So that bodes well for all of us. And that was really based on the timing of some renewals, not only initial sales, but also renewals. So we watched that very carefully. We watched duration. And when you look at deferred revenue, you see some of that did go into long term. So we did see some longer term renewals typically related to initial sales. But we've seen that short term and long term deferred revenue percentage stay remarkably consistent. So that will jump around a little bit by quarter, nothing to be concerned about on this. It was a great quarter of billings and the nice part is that will translate into cash flow next year. So hopefully that helps. Sidney Ho : Yes. Thank you. George Kurian : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Tim Long with Barclays. Please. Go ahead. Tim Long : Thank you. Yes, maybe two if I could. First, on the all-flash array front still pretty good growth, but you mentioned install base is still not moving that much. So could you talk a little bit about what you think NetApp can do to further get that install base over to all-flash given the better economics all around for you? And then second, if I could just go back to the Cloud ARR, business could you talk a little bit about kind of better conversion of your installed base on-prem and what you're seeing from the other large on-prem players? And if they are trying to enter into this piece of the market as well. Thank you. George Kurian : First of all, the installed base that we are penetrating is a very, very large installed base, and there are several factors that they consider as they look at new purchases, right, IT budgets, a mix of different system types. We did see a higher mix of our hybrid flash portfolio, where we have the only modern operating system that supports hybrid flash technology. In prior circumstances, when there was some uncertainty about budgets or economics, they would shift towards more of a value-oriented system, like a hybrid flash. So whether that's true or not, it's one data point, but we did see very strong hybrid flash unit shipments this quarter, which is why the total penetration into our install base was relatively flat. We continue to do the work to qualify more applications, more new workloads, and drive our field to go after new logos, as well as drive our install based conversion. There are incentives in place to sell new systems at a higher rate than renewals or refreshes, and those have been put in place for this year. And so I'm hopeful that that will drive more conversion. With regard to cloud ARR, I think, the main questions are, listen, we feel good about the acquisition of net new customers into our cloud portfolio. I think when we started the cloud journey, there was a concern that cloud growth would literally be offset by on-prem decline. We're not seeing that. And it's reflective of the strength of our portfolio on both fronts. And so, yes, could we do more to convert or install base to cloud? We have got incentives in place this year where the sales reps cannot make their number without selling cloud as a part of their overall kind of quota. And so there are discreet quotas set up for cloud, they have got to complete selling that to be able to accomplish their total compensation objectives. And so we've got work underway, we are doing enablements, but I do feel good about the fact that we are able to acquire a lot of net new customers. Those are our competitors' customers after all with our cloud storage portfolio. Tim Long : Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead. David Vogt : Great. Thanks for taking my questions guys. Just a quick question on the acquisition strategy. So before you decided to hit pause, can you kind of discuss how the pipeline was shaping up and how sort of the opportunities might have looked for that particular strategy given the re-pricing that we\u2019ve seen in both the public and the private markets. And when you think about the opportunity cost of pursuing \u2013 not pursuing transactions, how do we think that affects the ramp of the longer-term target in that sector or in that segment I should say? And then I have a quick follow-up. George Kurian : Listen, I think we\u2019ve had a disciplined acquisition strategy, right? We started with cloud storage. We enabled cloud storage to become multi-cloud across all the hyperscalers with both NetApp managed and native cloud services. We then added monitoring, which is cloud insights, organically taking one of our enterprise products and making it cloud ready and made that a multi-cloud monitoring service, so that customers could understand the performance of their applications. Then we brought in Spot, which gave us the compliment for compute that we had with storage, right, our organic storage. So now we\u2019ve got a multi-cloud infrastructure services portfolio that\u2019s truly unique in the market. And we are adding applications deliberately, right? So we\u2019re not trying to be in every application. We\u2019ve got specific applications that leverage the full portfolio of our infrastructure services. Spot PC for Virtual Desktop uses cloud volumes and Spot\u2019s computer optimization technology. We\u2019ve got spark for Kubernetes, which uses the Spot Ocean technology as part of its underlying infrastructure capability. And then most recently Instaclustr. I feel really good about the portfolio. Listen, we want to integrate these acquisitions so that they get off to a fast start. And I think we feel really good about our portfolio. If you look at the numbers that we are guiding to, I think if we hit, we finish FY2023 strong, we\u2019re in great shape to accomplish our $2 billion target. And we\u2019re just focused on, let\u2019s get these right in the first half of the year, and then we\u2019ll take a look at the market. David Vogt : Great. Thanks, George. And then Mike, maybe a follow-up for you on public cloud gross margin. What scale maybe can you give us a sense of scale that you need to get to your longer-term targets? Because even if I look before this quarter sort of the incremental gross margins, have been running in the low-70s as you invest in the business, and obviously there\u2019s some cost absorption issues, or maybe it\u2019s helpful if you can give us sort of an order of magnitude of what that Delta might look like from a margin perspective. So we could see the roadmap to that 75%-plus public cloud gross margin that you sort of targeted out there. Thanks. Mike Berry : Yeah. Hey, thanks, David. So I want to answer that by saying, hey, by the time we get to a billion dollars in ARR, and I\u2019m going to break it up for you a little bit, we would certainly expect to see us getting very close to at least the bottom of that range. And there\u2019s two major drivers to that ramp. In CloudOps, the majority of those products are software cloud based as those continue to grow, they are accretive to not only cloud, but certainly the total company. And hey, the other big driver here is in cloud storage. We are continuing to invest a good bit for all the right reasons to drive growth in A&F and GCP. As we\u2019ve talked about when it comes after a couple years, as we start to modulate that CapEx investment, those are being depreciated over three years that depreciation\u2019s going to start to cap out. It\u2019s going to have a significant positive impact to gross margins because now we\u2019re going to benefit from utilizing those assets longer than their accounting life, because their useful life is quite a bit longer. So of all the stuff we\u2019ve talked about, I feel really good about getting to 75%, at least at the bottom end, because of all those items. And to your earlier question, acquisitions will focus around those software and cloud assets as well. So all of those things added together make me feel really good about that range. George Kurian : If I were to just add one more\u2026 David Vogt : Great. That\u2019s \u2013 yeah, that\u2019s helpful. George Kurian : Yes. Hey, if I were to just add one more FSx is this software only solution. So as that ramps, that\u2019s also accretive. Mike Berry : Great point. Thank you. David Vogt : Yes, the clarification\u2019s very helpful. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Simon Leopold : Thank you very much for taking the question. First, I just wanted to see if maybe we can clarify what happened to gross margin for the public cloud in the quarter with the step down was there any new significant investments being made in terms of the deployed footprint ahead of revenue given that you\u2019re not facing the same kind of input cost issues that\u2019s just clarification. And then in terms of my longer-term question, I\u2019d like to see what you\u2019re hearing in terms of the demand side, that\u2019s influencing your forecast for the public cloud services revenue outlook. I heard a lot about the execution and the internal aspects, but I want to get a better understanding of the demand side of that equation. Thank you. Mike Berry : Sure. So, hey, Simon, it\u2019s Mike. I\u2019ll do the gross margin first. So a couple things, it did dip down a little bit from I believe 71% to 68%. There were two major drivers of that. Number one is a little bit lower revenue. Obviously there is some fixed costs in there. The other part is we\u2019ve continued to invest in the capacity specifically for A&F even though we are largely for our CapEx number for fiscal 2022 right about where we guided, there was a mix shift. Candidly, we spent less in facilities because I\u2019m going to bring up supply chain again. We had a little issues there that got pushed in 2023 and for all the good reasons, we actually deployed more capacity for A&F. Now that depreciation hits right away and then the ARR builds. So that those were the two major drivers. As we go through fiscal 2023, our goal is to get back to that 70%, Instaclustr will come in and call it mid-60s margin. And we expect that to fully get to about 70% exiting the year. And then as we continue to build ARR and leverage the existing footprint, that\u2019s why we feel good about getting back to 70% by the end of the year. So those are the margin puts and takes. George Kurian : On demand, we feel good. Listen, we had strong customer adds across the portfolio in the quarter. We continue to see good dollar based net retention rates of 159%. So we feel good and we\u2019re really focused on going and capturing the demand. Cloud continues to be a place where we see customers prioritizing investment. Simon Leopold : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you. On gross margins, you thought that 4Q would be the bottom in gross margins. I think you\u2019re saying that again today, but you\u2019re also saying first half will be roughly at the same level for this in the next quarter. If that the trajectory you had expected last quarter, or did things change that is causing you to bump along the trough margins for a longer time, especially given that fiscal 2Q, you typically have a much richer mix from federal that should be helping your gross margins take up higher, and I have a follow-up. George Kurian : Listen, I think what we\u2019ve said is the first half of this coming year will be relatively similar to what we had in Q4, which is substantially better than what we \u2013 that we realized a substantially better outcome than what we feared going into the quarter. I think what we said in the second half of year is a modest tailwind to the first half of the year. We see improvements in the supply chain through the course of the year. I think COVID-related freight should get better. I think the amount of open market purchases should hopefully get better over time. I think we\u2019re being a little bit cautious about where we are in the course of the year, but overall I think that\u2019s the picture. Wamsi Mohan : Okay. Thanks, George. And just as a clarification, I know you made several comments around PCS tracking a bit weaker than expected. But as you\u2019re mapping this onto longer term target, can you give you a thoughts around hitting pause on CloudOps M&A, which is a big part of the overall long-term guide. I mean, it\u2019s a substantial part of how you were originally getting to your long-term guide especially in light of the fact that valuation seem to come down you just did Instaclustr. Just wondering if, hitting the pause is more some cautiousness about the rate and pace of trajectory or is it about the speed of integrating some of these assets that you have acquired especially given the valuation compression that we\u2019ve seen in the market. Thank you. George Kurian : Listen, we don\u2019t expect the valuation compression to go away, right. I think we see that as the start of the journey. And so we see plenty of opportunity ahead to do inorganic polls. I think the focus we\u2019re trying to bring is, first of all, in our outlook, we feel really good about the outlook. We wouldn\u2019t guide the year to a strong number if we didn\u2019t feel that way. We see continued strength in organic innovation, for example, cloud storage and cloud insights. We\u2019ve done a substantial number of acquisitions in CloudOps and we\u2019re going to take a little bit of time to integrate them on the product side and integrate them on the go-to-market. I think it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s fruited, it\u2019s disciplined and we\u2019ll be \u2013 we feel very, very good about our portfolio, not just in cloud storage, but in CloudOps as well. Wamsi Mohan : Okay. Thanks, George. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I\u2019ll try and slip in two real quick if I can. I guess, the first one is, one of your competitors tonight talked about, actually some customers pulling forward demand from the back half of the year into the first half of the year. There\u2019s been a lot of discussion around the backlog. And so I\u2019m curious, number one, have you seen any of that and how would you characterize the duration of kind of the backlog you\u2019re seeing and how maybe that\u2019s changed over the last two or three quarters? George Kurian : We haven\u2019t seen any evidence of pull forwards or phantom demand. I think we have a close relationship with our customers. Every one of them has been quite balanced in terms of being a good citizen around, hey, we\u2019ll take some of our order and we\u2019ll wait for others. So I think we\u2019ve got a pretty balanced book of business. As we said, we\u2019ve had supply gate demand for two successive quarters, Q3 and Q4, very clearly saw the same pattern and backlog is elevated. Aaron Rakers : Yes. And this is a quick follow-up, a simple question. How would you characterize the competitive landscape? Dell EMC saw growth for the first time in a while this last quarter. How would you characterize what you\u2019re seeing competitively in the market? George Kurian : I think it\u2019s pretty much the same, pure and NetApp taking share from Dell and HP and several other players. So I would characterize it as no fundamental change, to be honest. Thank you. Aaron Rakers : Perfect. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital. Please go ahead. Nehal Chokshi : Yes, thanks. I realize you guys are not economists here. But what do you think is the probability of IT CapEx down cycle, giving pricing financial conditions. And then what are your thoughts on NetApp share gain trajectory being stunted for help by a potential IT CapEx down cycle as well. George Kurian : Listen, I\u2019ll just say, I\u2019m not an economist, right? We are in discussions with our customers. I would say, in every IT portfolio, there\u2019s probably projects that are strategic that will continue to be invested in regardless of supply chain constraints or economic environment or whatever it is, right. So I think those projects we see continuing, and we\u2019re going to be a part of those as much as we can. I think with regard to our competitive environment, listen, we are part of several mega trends that those will continue, right, cloud, data management, analytics, high performance computing environments. So long as we continue to innovate and stay focused. I think we\u2019ve got a good opportunity ahead. Nehal Chokshi : And so just to be clear, you expect your share gain trajectory the help or stunted by a potential IT CapEx down cycle. George Kurian : I think if there\u2019s an IT CapEx down cycle, what we generally see is within the IT spending envelope, transformational projects that are critical to business need will get prioritized. And so long as we are part of those projects, it\u2019s a share gain opportunity. Nehal Chokshi : Okay, great. Thank you. George Kurian : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And today\u2019s final question will come from Jason Ader with William Blair. Please go ahead. Jason Ader : Great. Thank you. I guess, George, just to wrap up what lessons has NetApp learned from these last couple of years where you\u2019ve been kind of on an acquisition bench in this cloud services space. As you kind of reflect on what you could have done better and what you need to do better, maybe just kind of summarize your thoughts there for us. George Kurian : Listen, I feel like we\u2019ve accomplished a lot, right? I think no one believed us when we said our cloud storage would be a native service in all of the three major hyperscale cloud providers. And we\u2019ve delivered on that. We said we would cross $500 million in cloud ARR and we\u2019ve delivered on that. We said cloud gross margins would be add or better than company average gross margins, we\u2019ve delivered on that. We said cloud would be a way for us to acquire a whole lot of net new customers, we\u2019ve delivered on that. And over the course of the last two years, we\u2019ve balanced organic innovation and there\u2019s been a substantial amount with complimentary deliberate acquisitions that allow us to serve a full customer\u2019s need right around an application portfolio. I think where we could do better is learn from the mistakes we made around integration, and we\u2019re going to \u2013 everybody learns from that and we\u2019re going to own that. And we\u2019re going to take \u2013 do the work that needed to integrate those acquisitions better in the first half of this year. But I don\u2019t think any of that diminishes from the opportunity in front of us or the place that we are. We\u2019re in a strong position and we\u2019re going to capitalize on it with disciplined execution. Jason Ader : Very good. Good luck. Thank you. George Kurian : Thank you. Before we close, we delivered a solid Q4 rounding out a strong FY2022 with the record levels of gross margin dollars operating income and earnings per share. Looking forward, we remain focused on capturing the substantial opportunity ahead as we scale our Public Cloud services while continue to drive growth in our Hybrid Cloud solutions. I want to underscore my confidence in the long-term thesis, we presented at our Investor Day of delivering value through sustained growth. Our alignment to customer priorities, strong balance sheet and prudent operational management put NetApp in a position of strength. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants will be in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Newton, Vice President and Investor Relations. Please, go ahead. Kris Newton : Thank you for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Mike Berry. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for second quarter and fiscal year 2023, our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability and shareholder returns, our resilience and opportunity for future growth in the turbulent macroeconomic environment, our ability to drive continued growth in both our Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud segments, our ability to invest in areas of high return while managing supply chain constraints and maintaining disciplined operational management, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially for a variety of reasons, including macroeconomic and market conditions such as the continuing impact and uneven recovery of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the resulting supply chain disruptions and the IT capital spending environment, as well as our ability to keep pace with the rapid industry, technological and market trends and changes in the markets in which we operate, execute our data fabric strategy and introduce and gain market acceptance for our products and services, and generate greater cash flow. Please also refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC and available on our website, specifically our most recent Form 10-K, including in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Risk Factors sections. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are posted on our website. I'll now turn the call over to George. George Kurian : Thanks, Kris. Welcome, everyone. Thank you for joining us this afternoon. We delivered a great start to the year, with company all-time Q1 highs for billings, revenue, gross margin dollars, operating income and EPS, fueled by broad-based demand across our portfolio and geographies. Achieving record results in the face of ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, decades-high inflation and supply constraints underscores our disciplined operational management. As organizations accelerate their data-driven digital and cloud transformations, our relevance grows. We are helping customers navigate disruption with a modern approach to hybrid multi-cloud infrastructure and data management. Our opportunity is defined by the complexities created by rapid data and cloud growth, multi-cloud management and the adoption of next-generation technologies such as AI, Kubernetes and modern databases. The urgency to address these priorities increased with the COVID pandemic, and is further driven by the turbulent macro economy. Customers are searching for ways to reduce costs, improve flexibility, increase automation and accelerate application delivery in the public cloud, in their own data centers and in hybrid cloud environments. Our role in helping organizations achieve these transformation goals underpins our strategy and confidence in future growth. Let me share with you a couple of examples how data intensive applications like AI drive demand for both our Public Cloud and Hybrid Cloud solutions. A global e-commerce company chose ONTAP AI for several AI workloads, including natural language processing, recommendation engines, and deep learning. Our ultra-high-performance storage, close partnership with NVIDIA and tight application integration were key to the win and the customer has realized better performance and reliability while reducing its operating costs and data center footprint. A Fortune 500 hyperscaler is adopting a hybrid cloud strategy to augment existing on-premises AI/ML workloads. It chose Azure NetApp Files to accelerate AI research and development on cutting-edge machine learning, training workloads for its AI business unit. The initial footprint consists of nearly one petabyte of Azure NetApp Files storage with plenty of opportunity for continued growth. Our AI solutions remove data processing bottlenecks at the edge, core, and cloud to enable more efficient data collection, accelerated AI workloads, faster time to insight, and smoother cloud integration. Now, let\u2019s turn to our Public Cloud segment performance for the quarter. In Q1, we continued to see strong demand for our Public Cloud services. Public Cloud ARR grew 73% year-over-year, exiting Q1 at $584 million. Public Cloud segment revenue grew 67% from Q1 a year ago to $132 million and dollar-based net revenue retention rate of 151% remains healthy. We continue to expand our Public Cloud customer base, the penetration into our Hybrid Cloud installed base, and the percentage of customers using multiple of our public cloud services. Storage services constitute approximately 60% of our Public Cloud ARR. We see significant opportunity for continued growth in this part of our business as we help customers migrate or deploy data-intensive, demanding storage workloads to the cloud. Early in Q1, AWS announced that FSx for NetApp ONTAP is SAP-certified. SAP certification for Azure NetApp Files has helped drive large, business-critical deployments on that service and we are excited about the potential to see similar workloads deployed on FSx for ONTAP. We recently announced that NetApp is the only cloud storage service provider certified and supported for use as an external data store for VMware Cloud environments, further expanding the opportunity for our public cloud storage services. We\u2019ve long been known for the high levels of enterprise-grade data services, we bring to on-premises VMware environments and now, we can bring those same benefits to VMware workloads running in the major public clouds. As we discussed on last quarter's call, we made organizational changes to increase focus on renewal and expansion motions and refined our go-to-market execution to better address the cloud operations opportunity. These actions are starting to deliver results. In Q1, Spot bounced back, returning to its prior growth trajectory. Cloud Insights stabilized but remains a work in progress as we continue to optimize our sales and customer success motions. We delivered a substantial amount of innovation in our cloud operations portfolio with announcements of general availability of Spot Security, Spot PC, and Ocean for Apache Spark, providing fully managed serverless infrastructure for Apache Spark, on Google Cloud. We also completed the acquisition of Instaclustr, a leading provider of fully managed open-source database, pipeline, and workflow applications. We can now combine the Spot capabilities of continuous infrastructure optimization, automation, monitoring, and security with expertise in deploying and operating fully managed open-source applications to help our customers focus on their business goals, building and releasing leading-edge applications at speed. Onto our Hybrid Cloud segment. In Q1, Hybrid Cloud revenue grew 6% year-over-year, driven by solid product revenue growth of 8%. All-flash array annualized revenue run rate grew 7% year-over-year to $3 billion. All-flash penetration of our installed base grew to 32% of installed systems. FAS hybrid arrays again posted strong unit growth. The breadth of our storage systems portfolio enables us to address a broad range of customer business, technical and economic requirements. Under a single, unified management environment, we offer high-performance all-flash arrays for mission-critical, performance-sensitive deployments, QLC-based all-flash arrays for capacity-oriented applications, and hybrid flash arrays for price-sensitive workloads. Despite the uncertain macro, the enterprise spending environment has remained steady, driven by priority investments in digital and cloud transformations. Organizations around the globe want to learn how NetApp can increase the performance and reliability of these transformational projects, while helping reduce cost, risk, and complexity. Our ability to address a broad range of customer problems, while also optimizing cloud and IT investments makes NetApp more resilient to a potential further slowdown than many of our peers. Just as our customers are looking to save while transforming, we, too, must be agile in our response to the dynamic macro. We will continue to invest into areas of high return to drive growth, while at the same time moderating spending elsewhere. In closing, we delivered a great quarter, kicking off a strong start to FY 2023. Customer priorities are increasingly aligned, with the solutions that we uniquely provide. You are seeing evidence of that in the strong growth of our revenue, billings, and profitability. I am proud of the NetApp team's focus, execution and disciplined operational management in navigating this dynamic environment. I'll now turn the call over to Mike to walk through the details of our outstanding Q1. Mike Berry : Thank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we go through the financial details, I think it would be valuable to walk you through the key themes for today's discussion. Number one, as George highlighted, we had an outstanding Q1 in a dynamic environment with all-time Q1 company highs for billings, revenue, gross profit dollars, operating income and EPS, despite an uncertain macro and unprecedented FX headwinds. Number two, our Public Cloud business had an outstanding quarter, with excellent performance by our cloud volume service offerings from AWS, Azure and Google Cloud, which collectively grew ARR over 100% year-over-year. We also saw improved execution in our CloudOps portfolio. Number three, as George mentioned, we continue to see healthy customer engagement and demand trends. Like everyone on this call, we are mindful of the complexity in both the macro backdrop and supply chain. We will remain extremely disciplined in running our business, while continuing to invest in our key strategic initiatives. And number four, we are reaffirming our full year guidance for revenue, margins, EPS, free cash flow and Public Cloud ARR, even when factoring in a 3 to 4-point revenue headwind from FX versus the 2-point FX headwind contemplated in our guide provided last quarter. Now to the details. As a reminder, I'll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. In Q1, despite elevated freight and logistical expense, significant component cost premiums and unprecedented FX headwinds, we delivered solid revenue with both operating margin and EPS coming in above the high end of guidance. Strong execution yielded Q1 billings of $1.56 billion, up 13% year-over-year. Revenue came in at $1.59 billion, up 9% year-over-year. Adjusting for the 4-point headwind from FX, billings and revenue would have been up 18% and 13% year-over-year, respectively. Our solid Q1 results were driven by broad-based demand across our portfolio and geographies. Our cloud portfolio continues to positively impact the overall growth profile of NetApp, delivering 3.5 of the 9 points in revenue growth. Hybrid Cloud segment revenue of $1.46 billion was up 6% year-over-year. Within Hybrid Cloud, we delivered product revenue growth for the sixth consecutive quarter and expect this momentum to continue as we go through fiscal 2023. Product revenue of $786 million increased 8% year-over-year. Consistent with growth in fiscal 2022, software product revenue of $476 million increased 15% year-over-year, driven by the value of our ONTAP software and data services. Total Q1 recurring support revenue of $598 million increased 3% year-over-year, highlighting the health of our installed base. Public Cloud ARR exited Q1 at $584 million, up 73% year-over-year, driven by strength in Cloud Storage services, led by Azure NetApp Files, AWS FSx for ONTAP and Google CVS. Public Cloud revenue recognized in the quarter was $132 million, up 67% year-over-year and 10% sequentially.  Recurring support and Public Cloud revenue of $730 million was up 11% year-over-year, constituting 46% of total revenue, a new record for NetApp. We ended Q1 with $4.2 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 7% year-over-year. Q1 marks the 18th consecutive quarter of year-over-year deferred revenue growth, which is the best leading indicator for recurring revenue growth. Total gross margin was 67%, in line with our guidance. Total Hybrid Cloud gross margin was 66% in Q1. Within our Hybrid Cloud segment, product gross margin was 50%, including a two-point year-over-year headwind from FX. Our growing recurring support business continues to be very profitable, with gross margin of 93%. Public Cloud gross margin of 70% was again accretive to the corporate average. The sequential increase in Public Cloud gross margin was driven by improving software mix within our Public Cloud business. We remain confident in our long-term Public Cloud gross margin goal of 75% to 80%, as we continue to scale the business and an increasing percentage of our Public Cloud revenue is driven by cloud and software solutions. Q1 highlighted the strong leverage in our operating model, with operating margin of 23%, despite the ongoing supply chain and currency headwinds. EPS of $1.20 came in nicely ahead of guidance. Cash flow from operations was $281 million and free cash flow was $216 million. During Q1, we had strong cash collections, while we continued to invest in inventory that included paying substantial premiums for constrained trailing-edge analog parts. This purchasing strategy allowed us to meet as much customer demand as possible, but was clearly a headwind to cash flow and gross margins. We are seeing early signs of relief in supply availability. The timing of a full supply recovery remains uncertain, however, as our inventory levels start to normalize, it will be a tailwind to free cash flow as we go through fiscal 2023. During Q1, we repurchased $350 million in stock and paid out $110 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $460 million to shareholders, representing 213% of free cash flow. We closed Q1 with $3.4 billion in cash and short-term investments. Now to guidance. We are reaffirming our fiscal 2023 guidance. Our revenue guide of 6% to 8% growth year-over-year now includes 3 to 4 points of FX headwind versus the 2 point headwind assumed in our original guidance provided last quarter. We will continue to grow and invest in our Public Cloud business and expect to exit fiscal 2023 with Public Cloud ARR of $780 to $820 million. At the ARR mid-point, we expect our Public Cloud segment to drive 4 points of total company revenue growth. In fiscal 2023, we expect gross margin to range between 66% and 67%, as elevated component costs and logistical expenses from supply constraints continue to weigh on product margins. Adding to these product cost overhangs is an additional 1 point from incremental FX headwinds. As you know, the vast majority of our bill of materials is procured in US dollars. We are cautiously optimistic that supply constraints will ease further in the second half of our fiscal year, reducing our dependence on procuring parts at significant premiums. We should also start to see a benefit from declining prices for our hardware components. While the timing is uncertain, we remain confident that our structural product margins will normalize back to the mid-50s in the fullness of time. Despite the incremental currency headwinds, we remain committed to driving operating margin of 23% to 24% and EPS of $5.40 to $5.60 for the full year. Like all of you, we are closely monitoring the demand signals and broader macro trends. As George noted, customer engagement and demand remain healthy, however, given the fluidity of the environment, we will continue to be appropriately measured in our outlook and extremely disciplined with our spending envelope. We continue to expect to generate greater than $1.4 billion in operating cash flow and $1.1 billion in free cash flow for the full year. Now on to Q2 guidance. We expect Q2 net revenues to range between $1.595 billion and $1.745 billion which, at the midpoint implies a 7% increase year-over-year, including 4 points of currency headwinds. We expect consolidated gross margin to range between 66% and 67%, and operating margin to be approximately 23%. We anticipate our tax-rate to be between 21% to 22%. And we expect earnings per share for Q2 to range between $1.28 and $1.38 per share. Assumed in our Q2 guidance is net interest expense of $5 million and a share count of approximately 223 million. In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for the outstanding execution in Q1, as a result the year is off to a strong start. I\u2019ll now hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris? Kris Newton : Thanks Mike. Operator, let\u2019s begin the Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Please, go ahead. Jim Suva : Thank you very much. And wow, congratulations to you and your team. Great results. My question to you is, look, the past two, two-and-a-half years have been very challenging with COVID. And it appears that NetApp has stepped it up by going the extra distance to procuring the shortages of parts, paying premiums and delivering to the customers. Does this set you up with relationships and customer expectations and even deeper, longer visibility and opportunities? I'm just kind of wondering, because it seems like you walked down this aisle of going way beyond just what a normal agreement would be. And it seems like things are even deeper now in a positive way. Thank you. George Kurian : Thank you, Jim. I think, first of all, we continue to see demand ahead of supply. We had a broad-based book of business in Q1, with healthy demand trends, and we're doing everything we can to meet customer expectations by procuring parts in as many ways as we can. We think that, that helps us to be able to deliver on the promises that we make to customers. I think equally importantly, we broaden the range of capabilities that we bring to customers, particularly with our cloud offerings, our cloud storage and our cloud operations portfolio that now address a vast range of both digital and cloud transformation. And so the combination of meeting expectations for the day-to-day business, as well as being part of their go-forward transformation, allowing them to kind of make their businesses a lot more digital and cloud capable, is helping us broaden our exposure to new buyers and customers and deepen relationships within existing buyers, as well as net new buyers. So I'm excited about what the year ahead holds for us. Kris Newton : Thanks, Jim. Next question, please. Operator : The next question will come from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. A couple of questions for me. Just on the outlook and saying that you're kind of observing signs for macro conditions, just any sense of, in your conversations, kind of any change in tone or what you would be looking for to kind of detect whether you were seeing any of that macro impact? And then maybe second question, just whether there's any benefit that you're seeing from memory prices kind of coming down that maybe offset some of the higher componentry costs that you're seeing elsewhere? Thanks. George Kurian : Good afternoon, Meta. Thanks for the question. I think, first of all, we have a broad book of business across geographies, customer segments, vertical industries. And so, we monitor the discussions going on with our field teams and customers about their intent to purchase, the project that they want to do with us. So I think, clearly, we continue to see healthy investment in the transformational projects. I think that we are fortunate, given the work we've done in the cloud business, to be able to participate in those projects in a truly unique way, whether they are in modernizing data centers or migrating them to cloud. I think that we continue to see new application deployment and business process transformations continue to take priority in customer budgets. In public sector, we saw the late start to public sector spending now start to create opportunity for us to participate, particularly with agencies that were generally closed to doing business during COVID, some of the more defense and security focused agencies that we couldn't really engage with because of the COVID trend. So overall, a good balanced book-of-business, priority on the transformational projects and then really kind of engagement across our customers showing a steady rebound from two years of COVID delays. Mike, do you want to talk about the supply? Mike Berry : Sure. Thanks, George. Meta, thanks for the question. So as we talked about on the earnings call last quarter, we did expect and we still do expect the memory prices to be a slight headwind in the first half and then moving to a tailwind in the second half. All the surveys and discussions we've had certainly support that. As you know, we did add a good bit of inventory after the issue that we saw with SSDs in Q4. So it will take a little bit of time to work through the P&L. And all of that is in our guidance, by the way, that we do expect to see memory prices become a little bit more of a tailwind in the second half. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks so much. Kris Newton : Thanks, Meta. Next question. Operator : The next question will come from Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much for taking my question. I was wondering, as we think about the growth in Public Cloud ARR up 73%, how should we think about the length of the contracts. Has there been any change, or I'm trying to think about how quickly that will continue to flow through in terms of cloud growth overall. Just as you talk to your customers in the environment that we're in right now, have you seen any shifts in contract length or timing of when you expect things to be recognized? And then I was just wondering, from a cost perspective, you mentioned being a little bit more cautious, I guess. I'm just wondering, are you still planning on increasing headcount. I mean, how cautious are you thinking when you look at your OpEx? Thank you. George Kurian : Yes. In terms of cloud contracts, we have a broad book-of-business. We have contracts that are subscription contracts. They're usually a couple of years in duration, so they can move around a bit. And then we have, of course, consumption type contracts, which are the type of agreements that we work on with customers in the kind of first-party cloud services, so a broad range. I think overall, we see strong demand for our offerings, because they help our customers use the cloud more efficiently. Our storage cloud services are much more efficient than sort of hyperscaler native services, so you can get more performance for less dollars using our capabilities. And then, of course, our cloud operations portfolio directly addressed customer concerns about cloud spending by optimizing their overall usage of compute and storage and network on the Public Cloud. Mike? Mike Berry : Yes. And keep in mind, too, as well, Shannon, that ARRs are \u2013 is what we expect to recognize during the next 12 months. So, those \u2013 that you'll see ARR tie pretty closely to revenue. And then on your headcount question, as we talked about, hey, we're going to be very disciplined. We want to continue to invest in the areas that are going to drive growth, specifically around cloud as well as some of our sales headcount. We are taking a look at just like everybody else, making sure that we reallocate dollars to drive growth, and we'll be very prudent around other additions. Shannon Cross : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you. And next question. Operator : The next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Sidney Ho : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just to follow up on the Public Cloud side. The ARR in Q1 seems to have come in better than expected, up 6% to 8% organically. It looks like the upside was driven by some of the issues being resolved like maybe in the Spot. But why not more positive on the ARR exiting the year? Is FX impact in this business? And can you talk about maybe some of the other issues that you're working on? When do you expect them to get resolved? Thanks. George Kurian : Listen, we're pleased to the start of the year. I think our cloud storage portfolio is really strong. And as we said, we are in the early innings with Amazon and Google, and there's plenty of opportunity to expand our business with them. We are doing the work to be able to do so. With regard to the cloud operations portfolio, we've had a really good start to the year in the Spot portfolio, which \u2013 where we've had new sales leadership, strong disciplined execution in the product team and in the field organization, and I feel pretty good about the focus so far. I think on Cloud Insights, we still have some more work to do, particularly sharpening the parts of the market that we attack and the execution on customer success motions in that part of the business. So we're pleased, we're at the end of the first quarter, if we see more strength at that point, we can talk about the full year guidance. But I feel really good about reiterating our guidance. It's a strong growth target for the full year for our cloud portfolio. And at the start of the year, we're off to a great start. Sidney Ho : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Sidney. Next question? Operator : The next question will come from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead. David Vogt : Hey, guys. Thanks again for taking my question. Maybe this is a question for both George and Mike. So when I think about the profitability and the challenges that the industry is facing, it looks like just quickly from our math, that the Hybrid Cloud incremental gross margin might be at the lowest level that we've seen in quite some time, kind of below 20%. And should we \u2013 so therefore, if I think about the business going forward, are we at the low-water mark from product gross margin this quarter given your commentary about supply chain getting better? And should we expect sort of a sequential improvement in product gross margin going forward, or is there something else under the hood like are we expecting some sort of Public Cloud gross margin pressure in the back half as well? I'm just trying to triangulate kind of where we are today versus where we might be in three to four quarters from now? Thanks. Mike Berry : Yeah. Hey, David, it's Mike. So, great question. So let's go through that. As we talked about on the call last quarter, we did expect and without the incremental impact of FX, it would have been true that, we expected product gross margins to be at its lowest in Q4. Q1 came in pretty much as we expected. When we gave the guidance at the midpoint, we're saying, hey, relatively consistent in Q2. To your point, keep in mind that on a year-over-year basis, we are paying, call it \u2013 and we talked about this a couple of calls ago, about $60 million a quarter for premiums. We expect that to continue in Q2 and then get better as we go through the rest of the year. In addition to Meta's earlier question, we do expect memory prices to get a little bit better in the second half. Again, all of that is baked into our guidance when we gave our full year number. So all else being equal, no crazy on the supply chain things happening or things that we don't know of at this time. We would expect gross margins to continue to improve as we go throughout the year. David Vogt : And then maybe can I just follow up, Mike. So you may be leveraging what Meta had asked before on operating expenses. Was there anything sort of unique in the first quarter? It certainly appeared to us, at least, maybe, there might have been some tight cost controls on your end to keep sales and marketing looks like flat year-over-year and down fairly meaningfully quarter-over-quarter. As supply chain gets better and revenue continues to ramp, should we expect some incremental dollars to flow back into the OpEx lines over the next couple of quarters? Mike Berry : Yes. So thanks for the question. So, overall, we were down about $20 million quarter-on-quarter total company. To your point, sales and marketing was down about 7%. There were three major moves -- movements in OpEx quarter-over-quarter. That was -- FX gave us about a $10 million benefit, because the stronger dollar means lower OpEx. Q1, David, we always have a reset of incentives, incentive pay as well as commissions, and that -- part of that flowed through sales and marketing. And then in R&D, mostly you saw the addition of Instaclustr. Also, keep in mind that marketing, one of the big variables there is just marketing spend program timing. Q1 is typically a lower program spend for marketing. So those are the three big movements. And as Meta asked as well, hey, we're looking hard at making sure that we're investing in growth. Candidly, sales and marketing will be one of those areas, especially as it looks to drive growth in cloud. David Vogt : Perfect. Thanks, Mike. Thanks again, guys. Kris Newton : All right. Thanks David. Next question. Operator : The next question will come from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please, go ahead. Michael Tsvetanov : Yes. Thank you. This is Michael on behalf of Aaron. How should we think about your recent price increases flowing through the model from a timing perspective? I guess, really what I'm trying to get at is, how much of your fiscal 2023 revenue growth can be attributed to those price increases? Thank you. George Kurian : Listen, we've implemented, as we have shared before, two price increases. And we are seeing our sales teams being disciplined to be able to capture the value of those price increases. The important thing to note is, customers' budget in dollars, they don't get incremental IT budget just because vendors raise prices. So I do not see the fact that our revenue is strong being tied to price increases. I think customers spend and you got to go get your fair share or more than your fair share of their spend. And so we'll continue to monitor how the supply base evolves, and we'll adjust pricing -- if we need to take another action, we will do that at the appropriate point in time. Right now, I don't see the need to do that. Michael Tsvetanov : Okay. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Michael. Next question? Operator : The next question will come from Rod Hall with Goldman Sachs. Please, go ahead. Rod Hall : Yes. Hi. Thanks for the question. I wanted to dig into the Americas commercial revenue a little bit, just the trajectory there. What I see there is quarter-on-quarter deterioration and a little bit worse than normal seasonality to about 12%. The last couple of years, you were just below 8% quarter-on-quarter, and that's off of an April quarter that was just flat seasonally. So it was weak seasonally in April as well. And then if I look at the year-over-year on that line, it was just under 7% year-over-year growth deteriorating from 10.5% last quarter and then about 20% the quarter before. So it looks like it's moderated a little bit. And I just wondered if you guys could maybe dig into what you think is happening there. Is there a demand fluctuation in that particular line, or is there something else going on? Mike Berry : Yes. Hey, Rod, it's Mike. Thanks for the question. So the big driver there is -- and we'll go back to what we talked about last time, it's really supply chain in terms of how it impacts the GOs on a quarterly basis. You did see nice growth in USPS, which was great. EMEA and APAC grew as well. So that was more really an issue of supply chain where we were able to place our product versus any change in demand on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Rod Hall : And Mike, can I just follow that up and asked, did you guys make a decision to allocate less to that particular group of customers, or is there any -- could you give us any more color on why maybe they got less supply than some of these other regions? Mike Berry : Yes. So it's a nuanced answer, Rod. And no, we didn't decide to do that. It depends on what availability we have, what customers are purchasing, when those purchase orders came in, linearity matters. So hey, there's a lot that goes in there, but no, there was no outright decision or direction that way. It just was how it fell in the quarter. Rod Hall : Okay. All right. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it. Mike Berry : Thank you. Kris Newton : All right. Thanks, Rod. Next question. Operator : Your next question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I have two as well. I'll ask them together. I guess, first off on an organic basis on the top line, it looks like you're actually raising your revenue guide by about 150 basis points or so given the FX issues you have. I'd love to just understand what is driving the better organic performance? Is it end-demand trends that are better or share gain and kind of which buckets are you see it on? That will be really good to understand. And then secondly, and Mike, it could just be for you, I think, but you beat Q1 by $0.10. Your Q2 guide, I think, it's about 5 to 6 ahead of The Street, but you're not raising your full year numbers really on an EPS basis. So I guess, what are you seeing or not seeing that's not letting you flow the upside in the first half on the EPS line to the back half? Thank you. George Kurian : I'll take the demand one, and then Mike will cover the EPS. First of all, we're pleased with the book-of-business we saw in Q1. Our teams are engaged with our customers deeply across all of the segments and geographies. And as you see from our results, we had a really good balanced book-of-business with strength across all of the geographies. I think with regard to the year ahead, listen, we are one quarter in. We feel really good about the progress. We are reiterating our guidance. Yes, you correctly note that we saw incremental FX headwinds from the time we guided. So by reiterating guidance today, it actually shows that we have confidence in our business through the course of the year. I would say if you ask me what's sort of top of mind for me at the moment, it really is about having supply, and I wish I could just get to confidence on having all of the supply we need to meet demand, right? And I think that is the place we continue to do the work. We feel that it's stabilizing, but supply is still behind demand. Mike Berry : Hey, Amit, on the EPS number, as you appropriately noted, we actually are raising the full year number when you take into account the incremental FX impact. And when you flow that through, I think that you're going to see that, there is actually a side ways EPS as well, although albeit not as much as revenue. So we feel \u2013 hey, we feel good about the year. We have \u2013 we've talked several times about reiterating the EPS as well as the operating cash flow number in an uncertain time. So we feel good about that range. As George said, hey, we'll see how the rest of the year goes. We'll take a look at it, but we are certainly very disciplined around our spending and targeted to make sure that we hit both profit and cash goals. Kris Newton : All right. Thanks, Amit. Next question. Operator : The next question will come from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Please go ahead. Matt Sheerin : Yes. Thank you. It looks like your all-flash ARR growth rates slowed somewhat from last quarter. It was up 7% versus up 12% last quarter, anything to read into that as far as trends and the transition to all-flash from customers, or was it just up against tough comps, supply constraints or other reasons? Thank you. George Kurian : The combination of some supply constraints and also we have an FX headwind to product revenue. I think given the percentage of our total book of business being all flash, you would assume that FX would affect it the same as our total book of business, so substantial headwind. I also think, it's too early to comment, but at times like this in the past, we have seen customers choose to buy more economic configurations in certain cases. So we had a strong quarter in our hybrid flash segment, which is really targeting customers who have \u2013 want to buy the most cost-effective configuration. And so we'll continue to monitor that. It's one quarter in, so I wouldn't call that a trend yet. Matt Sheerin : Thank you. Kris Newton : All right. Thanks, Matt. Next question. Operator : The next question will come from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Angela Zhang : This is Angela Zhang on for Samik Chatterjee. I just wanted to dig into the comment you made about over 100% growth in ARR from AWS, Azure and Google Cloud combined. I'm guessing the majority of that contribution comes from ANF just given its scale right now, but \u2013 do you mind parsing through how each one is trending and where you're seeing the greatest traction and where you might see it going in the future? Mike Berry : Hi, Angela, it's Mike. As we've talked about, ANF is the largest portion of CVS. All three of the products with the hyperscalers are performing well. We're not going to go into the trends individually. They're all at a different part of their stage in terms of go-to-market and product, but all three of them did well in the quarter relative to how they were. And yes, ANF continues to be the largest portion of that, and ANF performed quite well in the quarter. Kris Newton : All right. Thanks, Angela. Next question. Operator : The next question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes. Two follow-ups. Within your cloud data services, how should I think about the current mix of cloud storage versus cloud op? And how would this mix change over the next four to six quarters? And I have a follow-up. George Kurian : In cloud storage, as we said, is 60%. And we think that the mix should stay relatively stable over the next several quarters. Mehdi Hosseini : Okay. Because I'm looking at your AFA, All-flash array commentary you mentioned and it seems like if I were to just take your fiscal year 2023 guide, the AFA growth would accelerate FY 2022 AFA growth was 20%, this year tracking to low teen. And I was just trying to better understand if cloud data services will provide an uplift in addition to installed base that is upgrading. George Kurian : Listen, we saw customer challenges in multiple ways, right? I think, unlike some other players in the market, we can solve it through a cloud-based solution. We can solve it through a hybrid flash solution, as well as managed service offerings. So we\u2019re going to do what customers want and we\u2019re going to give them the full range of our portfolio. I think our flash offerings are strong. We have certainly been affected by the macro. But as we have shared before, the vast majority of our cloud growth comes from outside our on-premises installed base. So most of those customers are not buying our AFAs, they're buying new stuff. Mehdi Hosseini : Got it. Thank you. Thanks for the color. Kris Newton : All right. Thanks Mehdi. Next question? Operator : The next question will come from Krish Sankar with Cowen & Company. Please, go ahead. Krish Sankar : Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the great result. I have two quick ones. First one for George. How much visibility do you have into FY 2023? Because typical lead time to storage products is about two to three months. But with FY guidance reiterated, is it safe to assume you're starting to have some visibility into the back half of FY 2023? So any color on the visibility would be helpful. And then a quick one for Mike. Conversely, given the uncertain macro, especially heading into calendar 2023, how do you think about your operating leverage? I understand you have some ARR and subscriptions. But if product revenues are down, typical number, down 10% hypothetically, how do you think about margins and earnings in that environment, Mike? Thank you very much for taking my question. George Kurian : With regard to visibility, listen, we are engaged in conversations with customers. And as I said in my prepared remarks and the -- what we see within customers is, there are transformational projects that continue to receive the benefit of spending, right? These could be digital business process enablement. It could be data and analytics to better understand and target the customer base. It could be cloud migrations and accelerated application deployment. Those are all getting funded, right? And we get to participate in all of those. I think we have certainly more visibility into some of the larger accounts and spending plans, just because of the range of engagement we have with them, than maybe the smaller accounts, which are a smaller part of our total business. With regard to what we see going on, it's steady demand. As we said, some of our clients are recovering from two years of COVID pandemic. So while they may not be as excited about what the next year holds, they're still recovering from two years of delayed spending. And so these projects are moving forward. And so, we continue to work with our customers on their planning not only for this year, but also for the first half of next year, which comprises the finish of our fiscal year. Mike Berry : And Krish, hey, on your last question, the way I would answer that is, we certainly look at different scenarios. You mentioned 10% down. No one on this call had said that that's what we think it would be. We've looked at our operating expenses, where we spend our money, where we would look to reallocate or reduce if we saw a different scenario than we're calling for the year. Also, hey, keep in mind one important note, which is the majority of the gross profit is still being generated by support, which we feel very good about. And cloud continues to be a bigger part of that. Based on the midpoint of the guidance by the end of the year, cloud will be about a little over 10% of the revenue and that of gross profit as well. So that provides a nice buffer. So we're looking at all those things as we go into the year, nothing certainly that we would pull the trigger on unless we saw different scenarios rolling out. Hopefully\u2026 Krish Sankar : Thanks a lot, George. Thanks Mike. Yes, that is super helpful. Thank you very much. Kris Newton : All right. Thank you, Krish. Next question. Operator : Your next question will come from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Victor Chiu : Hi, guys. This is Victor Chiu in for Simon. If there was some back of the napkin math, that the Public Cloud NRR of 151% this quarter seems to implies strong Public Cloud ARR contributions from new customer bookings in the quarter relative to renewal expansion contributions. Is that an accurate assumption? And if so, were there specific drivers behind that this quarter? And how should we think about this dynamic going forward if we assume NRR continues to trend down as it has over the last several quarters? George Kurian : Listen, we've said that dollar-based net retention rate would come down over time. I think we said we've kind of stabilized around 120%, but we feel really good about the book-of-business we're adding. It will bump around a bit. New cohorts certainly are showing strong expansion trajectory, but I don't read anything particular into our book-of-business, right? I think we have really strong growth across the cloud portfolio, and we are acquiring a good new set of customers, especially with our hyperscaler routes to market. So there's plenty of opportunity ahead. We're going to continue to balance expansion with net new customer additions. Victor Chiu : Okay. Okay. So -- but is it right to think that baked into your kind of outlook that new bookings kind of play a bigger role? Is that kind of correct? George Kurian : I mean, listen, I think that as the installed base and cloud gets to be a bigger and bigger number, the amount of new additions, they are very strong, will naturally become a smaller part of the total business. So we're not -- we don't feel badly about the new customer additions at all. It's just -- it's the law of large numbers catching up with you. Victor Chiu : Okay. Okay. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Victor. Next question. Operator : The next question will come from Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Nehal Chokshi : Yes. Thank you. Congrats on strong solid results and effectively the guidance raise here. George, you talked about some of your customer wins, and I believe this is one of the first times, if not the first time where you talked about data ONTAP enabling better AI workload data management and being a key portion of these wins. Can you double click into that and talk about what's inherent in ONTAP that enables to AI workload data management? George Kurian : Yes. First of all, it isn't the first time we have talked about AI. It's been a strong contributor to our business over many quarters now. We have three things that we're excited about. First is the technology underpinning AI works great on file-based data, image analysis, natural language processing. Those are all tied to analyzing files. The second is AI requires high-performance training infrastructure to make the algorithm smart. And so high-performance file storage, we are the market leader without question in that part of the market. And I think over the last year, the third point I'll raise is, we have done really good work over the last few years with NVIDIA to build reference designs that combine their technology software vendors and our infrastructure. So I'm super excited about the opportunities ahead in that part of the market. And as you saw from my prepared remarks, we cannot only address it on-prem, but uniquely address it on the cloud as well. Nehal Chokshi : Great. Thank you very much. Kris Newton : Thank you, Nehal. Next question. Operator : Your next question will come from Steven Fox with Cross Research. Please go ahead. Steve Fox : It's Steve Fox from Fox Advisors. One quick question from me. Can you just talk about the hybrid storage rates a little bit more? It looks like they grew double digit year-over-year. I'm not sure the last one that happened. And it sounded like that mix was happening in the prior quarter as well. How much more do you think you have to deal with that negative mix shift in the product sales, especially since you're starting to see a loosening up of NAND and DRAM? Thanks. George Kurian : Listen, I don't see hybrid flash strength as a negative. I just think that we offer a broad range of capabilities for customers in certain workloads. Hybrid flash is obviously the right answer, because it gives you the combination of large amounts of capacity at a really cost-effective price point and with caching technology, the ability to generate good enough performance for those use cases. So, we actually feel like having cloud all-flash arrays, capacity flash arrays and hybrid flash arrays is the right answer for customers. And we do that not just a file and block, but also increasingly an object. Steve Fox : Okay. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Steve. Next question. Operator : The next question will come from Tim Long with Barclays. Please go ahead. George Wang : Hey, guys. It's actually George Wang on behalf of Tim Long here. Congrats again on the quarter. So I have two questions. Firstly, just kind of holding on the cloud ops in terms of future tuck-in acquisitions, last time you guys talked about the folding in the first half just given kind of a valuation has come in rapidly for the private market companies, is there any sort of shift in the strategy in terms of maybe kind of pick up some private kind of near-term? George Kurian : Listen, we are disciplined acquirers. We have done well with the start to the year. That doesn't mean that we don't have more work to do to integrate the acquisitions we've already completed, especially both CloudCheckr and Instaclustr, right? So we're deeply involved in doing that work. That work should be wrapped up soon, right, at least the preponderant majority of that work. And we continue to monitor the landscape. We won't rule out doing things that they are massively advantaged, but we're also just trying to be balanced, disciplined acquirers so that we can make sure that the acquisitions we already have done are off to strong starts. George Wang : Great. So my follow-up is, just if you can unpack on the billings and the deferred both are kind of de-metrics. So when I look at the billings, so it decelerated by 3%, but that's probably the kind of FX you guys mentioned also from maybe some seasonality, some tough compare with versus quarter last year. But it's good to see deferred rev actually accelerated. So maybe you can unpack it a little bit, maybe talk about any update you saw from kind of software support renewal front? Mike Berry : Sure, George. So, hey, a couple of answers to that. So thanks for asking about billings. So keep in mind that it was 13% this quarter, but 18% on a constant currency basis. So it actually did accelerate quarter-over-quarter. I believe it was 16% last quarter. If I missed that, I apologize. What drove the billings growth mostly in Q4 of last year was, as you know, its revenue plus change in deferred. Most of that growth was from support. We had a very good support quarter in Q4. You saw that in the deferred revenue results. This quarter, it was nice. Support did well. Again, but really, it was cloud that drove a good bit of the billings growth. So the 13% as reported, cloud was about 7.5% of that. So it was a big driver. And a lot of that was what George talked about, us getting our feet under us again around CloudOps because that's where you'll end up doing subscription arrangements. So that is to compare on billings. Again, keep in mind, on an FX-adjusted basis, really strong billings quarter. George Wang : Okay, great. Thanks. Mike Berry : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks, George. Next question. Operator : The next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please, go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you. On the Public Cloud ARR, can you just parse through what was organic versus inorganic in the quarter? And last quarter, you had noted that you were expecting the trajectory to accelerate as you go through the course of the year. Is that still your view? Or do you expect that you sort of turned it around a little bit faster than you thought and that trajectory sort of maybe doesn't really accelerate from here? And I have a quick follow-up on gross margins. Mike Berry : Sure. So, hey, Wamsi, thanks for the question. So let's go through the ARR results in the quarter. So as we expected, Instaclustr came in right around $34 million, $35 million. And as we talked about, we expected to see good growth through the year, a little bit of acceleration in the second half. That's still where we are. So organic, I would -- I'm going to define that as everything except for Instaclustr because we had CloudCheckr in Q4, grew by $45 million and then Instaclustr was about $34 million to $35 million. That gets you to the $585 million. That's about a 9% growth quarter-on-quarter. We would expect Q2 to be, call it, between 10% and 11% growth on the $584 million and then the second half, right around 11%. So a little bit more, not much. It's certainly nowhere near -- well, maybe it's an old hockey stick where they weren't curved at all. But -- so a little bit of growth but not much, and that gets us to about the $800 million midpoint. So we feel really good about the rest of the year and how we need to grow that on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Wamsi Mohan : Okay. That's really helpful color, Mike. And then on gross margin, your fiscal 2Q gross margin guide, it's roughly flat quarter-on-quarter, but you are getting significant positive revenue leverage and 5% sequential at the midpoint. You got a positive mix from federal potentially. So what would you say are some of the key offsets outside of FX, or do you see the opportunity to potentially deliver some upside to those gross margin numbers? Thank you. Mike Berry : Yes. So thanks for the question. The big mover there is at that kind of quarter-on-quarter basis, keep in mind, hey, the USPS had a really good Q1. That's much more of a programmatic spend now versus a big bump that you used to see in Q2. We expect premiums to continue to be relatively consistent. And then while, again, we expect the memory prices to help, that's really a second half of the year, because we have to work through some of the inventory that we very appropriately put on the balance sheet before. So we feel good about that number. We'll see. And here's a big thing, mix really matters on gross margin, not only within the product, but also within those products in terms of entry level versus some of the higher ones. So there's a lot of moving parts. We feel good about it. Again, we expect the second half to see that product margin increase as we go through the year. Wamsi Mohan : Thank you so much. Kris Newton : Thank you, Wamsi. Next question. Operator : The last question will come from Jason Ader with William Blair. Please go ahead. Jason Ader : Yes, thanks. Thanks for squeezing me in. I guess, George, I wanted to ask you about the environment that we're in right now in terms of whether it's had an impact on demand for Spot relative to the last couple of years. Like have you seen any acceleration in interest? Maybe it's not actual ARR yet, but it's pipeline. It's just -- I know that a lot of customers are scrutinizing cloud costs right now. And it seems like Spot is really a perfect type of tool for them in this type of climate. George Kurian : Yes. Clearly, the Spot portfolio, which helps with both resource constraints in terms of talent with automation as well as the raw cost of cloud spend and kind of keeping track of where you're spending in the cloud is perfectly set up for this environment. We are off to a good start to the year with our Spot portfolio. We intend to widen and broaden customer engagement in line with the pattern that you just appropriately identified. Jason Ader : Okay. So I guess is that -- does that mean that you have seen an acceleration in interest? I guess, I didn't catch the some of comment. George Kurian : Listen, customers are appropriately scrutinizing their cloud spend. And I think as they begin to understand that we have a tool set to help with them, we're seeing good proof-of-concept, good trials going on in the Spot portfolio. Jason Ader : Okay. Great. Thank you. Kris Newton : All right. I'll turn it back over to George. George Kurian : Thanks, Kris. In summary, Q1 was a great start to the year, setting company records for Q1 billings, revenue, gross margin dollars, operating income and EPS. Despite the uncertain macro, the enterprise spending environment has remained steady, driven by priority investments in digital and cloud transformation. Our ability to address the challenges created by these initiatives with a broad portfolio drives our growing relevance with organizations globally. We will continue to maintain our focus on our top priority, while driving disciplined execution and operational management to deliver increasing shareholder value. Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Newton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kris Newton : Hi, everyone, thanks for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian, and CFO, Mike Berry. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com. During today\u2019s call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for third quarter and fiscal year 2023, our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability, and shareholder returns, our alignment with industry megatrends and expectations regarding the future growth in the number of cloud customers and their usage of cloud services, our ability to deliver innovation and focus on our strategic growth opportunities while optimizing our operating costs, and our ability to drive sustained growth in both our Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud segments in a turbulent macroeconomic environment, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially for a variety of reasons, including macroeconomic and market conditions such as inflation, rising interest rates and foreign exchange volatility, the continuing impact and uneven recovery of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the resulting supply chain disruptions, and the IT capital spending environment, including the focus on optimization of cloud spending, as well as our ability to keep pace with the rapid industry, technological and market trends and changes in the markets in which we operate, execute our evolved cloud strategy and introduce and gain market acceptance for our products and services, and manage our gross profit margins and generate greater cash flow. Please also refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, and available on our website, specifically our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q including in the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Risk Factors sections. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are posted on our website. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to George. George Kurian : Thanks, Kris and welcome everyone to our Q2 FY 2023 earnings call. Coming off a strong Q1, our team delivered a solid quarter, with all-time highs for Q2 billings, revenue, gross profit dollars, operating income, and EPS. We remain focused on disciplined operational management and the execution of our strategy, which is tightly aligned with customer priorities. On today\u2019s call, I will walk through four topics; one, we delivered a good quarter in a dynamic environment. However, we are disappointed with the deceleration of growth in our cloud services. Our conviction in the cloud opportunity and our ability to execute against it is unwavering. Two, we are aligned with the durable, megatrends of data-driven digital and cloud transformations. We continue to deliver innovation that furthers our already strong position. Three, we believe strongly in the opportunity ahead, but have slightly tempered our revenue outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year, due to near-term macro headwinds. Four, we understand the imperative to deliver shareholder value in a slowing environment and will focus on our strategic growth opportunities, while continually optimizing our operating costs. Let's start with the first point, our performance in the quarter. Q2 public cloud segment revenue increased 63% year-over-year to $142 million and dollar-based net revenue retention rate remained healthy at 140%. However, Public Cloud ARR of $603 million fell short of our expectations. As our cloud partners discussed on their earnings calls, growth has slowed as customers look to optimize cloud spending. This macro-related optimization caused some slowing of growth in our cloud storage services as well. Additionally, we had a few customers with very large project-based workloads like chip design, that came to their natural conclusion, resulting in capacity reductions in those environments. We expect these customers to kick off new projects early next calendar year, as the number of cloud customers and their usage of our cloud services grows, the impact of this type of workload will be smoothed over a much broader customer base. In our cloud operations portfolio, Spot is benefiting from the same desire to optimize cloud spending that was a headwind to our cloud storage services. Spot's value proposition is a strong engine for new logo acquisition and Q2 saw an acceleration of new Spot customer additions from Q1. As we've discussed on past calls, we continue to refine our approach to cloud insights and are seeing early positive signs, with the growth of new Cloud Insights customers in Q2. We continue to see healthy growth of new-to-NetApp customers and of existing NetApp enterprise customers adopting our cloud services and those customers are growing in scale as well. The number of customers with greater than $1 million in ARR has more than doubled from Q1 last year. Our public cloud services are highly differentiated and create customer preference for NetApp. We have a multiyear advantage over our traditional competitors in this critical market, positioning us well to deliver sustained growth. Compared to Q2 a year ago, Hybrid Cloud revenue grew 3% and our all-flash array business increased 2% to an annualized revenue run rate of $3.1 billion. Adjusting for the significant FX headwinds, Hybrid Cloud grew 8% and all-flash grew 7% in constant currency. All flash penetration of our installed base grew to 33% of installed systems. Our lower cost, capacity-oriented all-flash arrays and FAS hybrid flash arrays, both performed well. Onto the second point, our alignment to the industry megatrends and our continued innovation. The world is moving faster than ever, raising data-driven digital and cloud transformations to business necessities. NetApp helps meet these objectives with a modern approach to hybrid multi-cloud infrastructure and data management that we term the evolved cloud. We provide customers the ability to leverage data across their entire estate with simplicity, security, and sustainability, which increases our relevance and value to our customers. We believe strongly in the sizeable, durable, and growing opportunity created by these megatrends. As many of you know, we bring significant value to customers running VMware environments on-premises. With a series of announcements made in conjunction with VMware, we are now able to bring that same value to customers in the cloud. Our native cloud storage service integrated with VMware, helps customers quickly, easily, and cost effectively migrate enterprise workloads to the cloud and accelerate modern application development using Kubernetes. We are the only certified and supported third-party cloud storage solution for VMware Cloud, which creates significant new opportunity for us. As those VMware environments move to the cloud, we can capture the data that resides on competitors\u2019 on-premises systems. At the start of November, we introduced BlueXP, the next big step in fulfilling our vision to give customers the simplicity, security, savings, and sustainability needed for an evolved cloud. It delivers true hybrid, multi-cloud operations by bringing storage and data services together in a single, unified control plane. BlueXP is a highly differentiated solution that enables customers to deploy, discover, manage, and optimize not only infrastructure and data, but supporting business processes across multiple clouds and on-premises environments. In addition to bringing forward technical capabilities, we are helping customers achieve their environmental goals by creating energy efficient products. We have added power and temperature reporting in Cloud Insights to give customers a real-time view into energy expenditure and our carbon footprint reports provide a reasonable estimate for the carbon impact of their NetApp systems. We enhanced our storage efficiency with a 4 :1 efficiency guarantee for SAN workloads to help customers minimize their storage footprint and lower energy usage. We not only help customers practice sound environmental stewardship, we practice it ourselves. I am proud to announce that EcoVadis, the leading evidence-based ESG rating agency, awarded NetApp a gold ranking, placing us within the top 7% of evaluated companies. Now the third point, the macro environment and our business outlook. As we moved through the quarter, we saw increased budget scrutiny, requiring higher level approvals, which resulted in smaller deal sizes, longer selling cycles, and some deals moving out of the quarter. In Q2, we felt this most acutely in the Americas hi-tech and service provider sectors. We see no change to our underlying opportunity and are confident in our position. However, current economic realities and unprecedented FX headwinds are and will continue to impact IT spending, causing us to temper our revenue expectations for the second half. And finally, point four, driving shareholder value. In response to the slowing top line, we are being agile and taking action to lower operating expenses. Already, we have implemented a broad-based hiring freeze, and are reducing discretionary spending, as well as further optimizing our real estate footprint. We will remain disciplined as we continue to shift resources away from lower yield activities to our biggest opportunities. In closing, we are clearly aligned with our customers' strategic priorities and remain confident in our long-term opportunity, despite the current external headwinds. By focusing on what we can control, we will aggressively seek to maximize the near-term return on our product and services portfolio, while leveraging our leadership position in all-flash, cloud storage, and cloud infrastructure optimization. I would like to thank the entire NetApp team for delivering a strong first half. In a challenging environment, we remain focused on innovation, execution, and operational discipline. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mike. Mike Berry : Thank you, George. Good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we go through the financial details, I think it would be valuable to walk you through the key themes for today\u2019s discussion. Number one, as George highlighted, we delivered a strong Q2 in a dynamic environment, with all-time Q2 company highs for billings, revenue, gross profit dollars, operating income and EPS. Number two, we have adjusted our outlook for the second half of the fiscal year due to an increasingly challenging macroeconomic environment and unprecedented FX headwinds. Number three, as we navigate through the current macro environment, we are laser focused on driving operating margins and free cash flow generation. As George noted, we have taken actions to reduce our full year expense envelope and will remain fluid in assessing further opportunities to take costs out of the business. Number four, as a result of these cost savings measures, the entirety of the Op margin and EPS guidance revision for the full year is being driven by the incremental one to two points from the deepening currency costs we have seen, since our Q1 call; and number five, we continue to expect to generate greater than $1.4 billion in operating cash flow and $1.1 billion in free cash flow for the full year. From a capital allocation perspective, we will continue to pause Cloud Operations acquisitions for the remainder of fiscal '23. We now plan to return more than 100% of fiscal '23 Free Cash Flow to investors through dividends and incremental share repurchases. Now to the details. As a reminder, I\u2019ll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. Q2 billings were $1.6 billion, up 3% year-over-year. Revenue came in at $1.66 billion, up 6% year-over-year. Adjusting for the 540 basis point headwind from FX, billings and revenue would have been up 9% and 12% year-over-year, respectively. Even with the challenging Q2, our cloud portfolio continues to positively impact the overall growth profile of NetApp, delivering 3.5 of the six points in revenue growth. Hybrid Cloud segment revenue of $1.52 billion was up 3% year-over-year. Product revenue of $837 million increased 3% year-over-year. Total Q2 recurring support revenue of $607 million increased 3% year-over-year, highlighting the health of our installed base. Public Cloud ARR exited Q2 at $603 million, up 55% year-over-year. Public Cloud revenue recognized in the quarter was $142 million, up 63% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. Recurring support and Public Cloud revenue of $749 million was up 11% year-over-year, or 16% in constant currency, constituting 45% of total revenue. We ended Q2 with $4.1 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 5% year-over-year, or 10% in constant currency. Q2 marks the 19th consecutive quarter of year-over-year deferred revenue growth, which is the best leading indicator for recurring revenue growth. Total gross margin was 66.3%, in line with our guidance. Total Hybrid Cloud gross margin was 66% in Q2, including a two-point year-over-year headwind from FX. Within our Hybrid Cloud segment, product gross margin was 50%, including a three-point year-over-year headwind from FX. Our growing recurring support business continues to be very profitable, with gross margin of 93%. Public Cloud gross margin of 68% was accretive to the corporate average for the eighth consecutive quarter. We remain confident in our long-term Public Cloud gross margin goal of 75% to 80%, as the business scales and an increasing percentage of our Public Cloud revenue is driven by cloud and software solutions. Q2 highlighted the strong leverage in our business model, with operating margin of 24%, including two-points of FX headwinds. EPS of $1.48 came in nicely ahead of guidance and included a $0.21 year-over-year FX headwind. Cash flow from operations was $214 million and free cash flow was $137 million. Q2 included our annual repatriation tax payment and continued cash outflows for certain inventory and premiums for constrained trailing edge analog parts. Additionally, collections were lower than expected due to a backend loaded quarter for invoicing linearity that you see in the higher accounts receivable balance. Our component purchasing strategy allows us to meet as much customer demand as possible, but remains a clear headwind to cash flow and gross margins. We are seeing signs of relief in supply availability. The timing of a full supply recovery remains uncertain, however, as our inventory levels start to normalize, it will be a tailwind to free cash flow as we go through the second half of fiscal '23. During Q2, we repurchased $150 million in stock and paid out $108 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $258 million to shareholders, representing 188% of free cash flow. Share count of 220 million was down 4% year-over-year. We closed Q2 with $3 billion in cash and short-term investments. Now to guidance. As George discussed, we have seen softening in the macro backdrop, with customers taking a decidedly cautious approach to spending. Additionally, currency headwinds have only continued to increase. We now expect fiscal '23 revenue to grow 2% to 4% year-over-year, which includes five points of FX headwind versus the four-point headwind assumed in our prior guidance. We now expect to exit fiscal '23 with Public Cloud ARR of approximately $700 million, which equates to our Public Cloud segment driving three-points of total company revenue growth for the full year. Three drivers are impacting the near-term growth rate of Cloud ARR. Number one, in this macro environment, we project continued optimization of storage services, as we help our customers manage their spending, which benefits Spot, but will offset some incremental near-term storage services ARR. Number two, we expect that project-based workloads will grow in both number and scale, but as they ramp, it will take some time to materialize into sizable ARR; and number three, we continue to tighten up the Cloud Insights sales motion, but we don\u2019t expect this meaningful cross-sell opportunity to materialize until we head into fiscal '24. In fiscal '23, we continue to expect gross margin to range between 66% and 67%, as elevated component costs and FX headwinds weigh on product margins. As you know, the vast majority of our bill of materials is procured in US dollars. We are optimistic that supply constraints will ease further in the second half of our fiscal year, reducing our dependence on procuring cost at significant premiums. We should also see a benefit from declining NAND prices in Q4. While the timing is uncertain, we remain confident that our structural product margins will normalize back to the mid-50s in the fullness of time. For the full year, we expect operating margin of approximately 23%, which now includes approximately two points of FX headwind and EPS of $5.30 to $5.50, which now includes more than $0.70 of currency impacts. It\u2019s important to reiterate that we are offsetting the full year revenue adjustment with an extremely disciplined approach to our spending envelope. As a result, the entirety of the Op margin and EPS guidance revision for the full year is being driven by the incremental one to two points from the deepening currency costs we have seen since our Q1 call. We continue to expect to generate greater than $1.4 billion in operating cash flow and $1.1 billion in free cash flow for the full year. From a capital allocation perspective, we will continue to pause cloud operations acquisitions for the remainder of Fiscal 2023, as we sharpen our portfolio focus by refining the Cloud Insight value proposition and sales motion, accelerating the integration of Spot and CloudCheckr into a single FinOps suite, and driving the successful integration of Instaclustr. As I said earlier, we now plan to return more than 100% of fiscal 2023 free cash flow to investors through dividends and incremental share repurchases. Now on to Q3 guidance. We expect Q3 net revenues to range between $1.525 billion and $1.675 billion, which at the midpoint implies a 1% decrease year-over-year, or 4% growth in constant currency. We expect consolidated gross margin to be approximately 67% and operating margin to range between 22% and 23%. We anticipate our tax rate to be between 21% to 22%. And we expect earnings per share for Q3 to range between $1.25 and $1.35 per share. Assumed in our Q3 guidance is net interest income of $5 million and a share count of approximately 220 million. In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for their continued commitment in such a dynamic environment. I\u2019ll now hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris? Kris Newton : Thanks Mike. Operator, let\u2019s begin the Q&A. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Amit Daryani with Evercore. Please go ahead. Pardon, Amit, your line might be muted. Unidentified Analyst : Can you hear me? Kris Newton : Yeah, we can hear now. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. So this is Abdulla [ph] speaking in for Amit. So I think your guys' cloud ARR expectation is coming down by $100 million versus prior expectations. And I just wanted to ask whether you guys could perhaps touch on the softness there? Is this more on compute, storage or analytics? And maybe if there's one cloud provider where the ramps are more challenged versus not? I would appreciate any details here. Thank you. George Kurian : I think we expect to see the continuation of some of the trends that we saw in Q2, which is the consumption oriented cloud offerings in our portfolio, which are cloud storage services were most impacted by customers wanting to reduce their spending. It could involve either them reducing the amount of capacity they use on our offerings or us proactively helping them migrate some of their workloads from a high-performance tier to a more cost-effective tier, so that they will continue to see value and benefit with us. That's one. Second, we saw in Q2 some project-based workloads, for example, large-scale semiconductor design that came to its natural conclusion. We anticipate some of those workloads coming back in the early part of next calendar year, but we are being cautious about that. And then finally, with our Cloud Insights product, we have continued to work to sharpen the focus on the use case of the products. We saw some early success in terms of new customer wins -- new to Cloud Insights customer wins. But we're being cautious about the future growth rate of that product until we see further evidence of success. So I think those were the three. I did not see anything materially different between the different cloud providers. Clearly, our relationship with Microsoft is the largest of the three, given that we've worked with them for the longest, and so they saw the biggest impact this quarter. A \u2013 Kris Newton : Thank you. Next question please. Operator : Our next question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead. Q \u2013 Mehdi Hosseini : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Two follow-ups. George, if I just take your guidance commentary, you suggest that all-flash array revenues should show Q-over-Q and year-over-year decline in January quarter? A \u2013 George Kurian : We don't -- we didn't guide anything specific in terms of all-flash array revenue. We have guided at the total company level. We're being cautious about our outlook given what we saw in the quarter and the continued macroeconomic environment. We are not guiding any specific product category maybe. Q \u2013 Mehdi Hosseini : Just that's what I walked away with. Is that a realistic assumption for all-flash array revenues were to decline? A \u2013 Kris Newton : We're not guiding down to the product line, Mehdi. Sorry, that we can't help you with that. Q \u2013 Mehdi Hosseini : Yeah. That's fine. At least I tried. Just -- and then a follow-up to your comment about the chip design. There's obviously product migration. They are expected to introduce new products for AI application. You also suggested that, that should help you with a rebound in the cloud data services. And I want to better understand whether your underlying assumption, do you think that product transition is going to ramp in early calendar year. Is it -- is your guide on cloud data services completely derisked given this transition. Sometimes these transitions take longer. And I'm just wondering what are the key assumptions there? A \u2013 George Kurian : I think with our cloud outlook, we've been cautious to address three topics, right? One is consumption services on the cloud are being impacted by customers reducing spend either by optimizing the performance level that they use or the total capacity they use in our cloud storage services. That will happen for a period of time and then we will see build back. We don't see that yet in the outlook. I think with regard to project-based workloads, listen, there are lots of different customers with different projects. I think in this case; we saw a few large projects come off our environment. And we've been cautious about how many of those come back in terms of our outlook. It will take time for them to come back as new projects and new chip designs. We are the only option in the public cloud for semiconductor chip design technologies to be verified as a cloud service. So, we expect, over time, more and more customers will use our cloud services but that will take time. And then I think in our CloudOps portfolio, as I said, we are pleased with the work that we've done so far. There's still more work to be done. And so we're being appropriately cautious about how fast that product portfolio, especially Cloud Insights grows in the second half of this year. Mehdi Hosseini : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead. David Vogt : Great. Thanks guys for taking my question. Hi George, hi Mike. Maybe just a big picture question on macro and linearity and how you thought about the quarter as it progressed because obviously, you did a good job of cutting costs, managing the business to the economic backdrop. But all-flash arrays were relatively weaker in the quarter, suggesting that obviously, you probably knew early in the quarter that customers were looking for more maybe cost conscious or cost-effective solutions. And you mentioned a lot of decisions were picked up to the CTO level or the CFO level. So, can you, kind of, discuss what you saw as the quarter progressed from a demand perspective? Was there a pivot point or was it just sort of a gradual bleed as we walk through each of the months? And how did it relate to, let's say, 90 days ago when we had this conversation? Thanks. George Kurian : I think it got progressively worse through the quarter. I think you see us being appropriately cautious in our guide as a result as well. I think that the rate increases getting compounded at a very fast clip certainly impacted customers' business confidence, and that got the range of customers that were affected with their business confidence grew through the quarter and the depth of the impact on spending grew. I don't think we saw any particularly meaningful shifts between product mix in the quarter. Hybrid flash has performed well for a few quarters now and all-flash has been -- as a percentage of our total mix has been more steady than as a growing percentage of our mix. So, I think -- I don't think that our view of the product portfolio affected as much as the view of the total business opportunity available in customers. I'll let Mike add any color. Mike Berry : Yes. Thanks, George. So David. Per George's comments, when we saw linearity in the quarter, month one was relatively consistent with what we've seen in, I'll call it, non-Q4 quarters. What we really saw was month two push into month three. And typically, we will see, call it, mid 40% of transactions and invoices in month three. That pushed to almost 60% this quarter. So, what you saw was in the second month of the quarter really started to push into the third month. And that's what we saw that really back-end linearity that I spoke about in my prepared remarks. David Vogt : Got it. And maybe just a quick follow-up for you, Mike. Just maybe on the currency headwinds, that incremental point or two. I know your business is primarily denominated in dollars. But can you kind of help us understand that transition from negative three to negative four to negative five, the US dollar has weakened a bit as of late. Just kind of want to get a better understanding kind of what's under the surface there and what's kind of driving that incremental headwind from an FX perspective? Thanks. Mike Berry : Yes. Sure, David, happy to. So, the significant foreign currencies we have like most international companies, it's euro, GBP, yen and Aussie dollar. And what we saw, again, across most of those is August and September was when the dollar was the strongest. So, that's when the most significant impact hit. That stayed largely through October. Now, what we saw after our quarter ended, is, hey, it got a little bit better in November, the dollar weakened a little bit. Yes, we'll see if that holds. Everything we've put in front of you, we have used FX rates as of the end of October. So, it says a little bit better, that will be good. But making our living betting on FX rates, we're not going to try that. So we use October rates for the rest of the year. David Vogt : Yes, that's helpful. End of the mouth is great. Perfect. Thanks, Mike. Thanks, George. Mike Berry : Thank you, David. Operator : Our next question will come from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Angela Jin : Hi. This is Angela Jin on for Samik Chatterjee. And my first question. So, I think in your prepared remarks, you mentioned that, customer weakness was concentrated in Americas hi-tech and service provider sectors. Can we just dive more into the dynamics of each of your customer vertical/segments. Were there certain ones that held up better, enterprise versus SMB, for example? And what types of specific behaviors or patterns that you see in each vertical? George Kurian : We don't have any specific vertical that is a material contribution to our revenue. Let me start there. I think the -- what we saw through the quarter was, public sector did well, both in the Americas and internationally. I thought that our European team performed exceptionally well to deliver a strong result in the face of increasing headwinds. And in our outlook for the international markets, we are appropriately cautious about Germany, where our team did phenomenally well in Q2, but there's just growing pressure economically. I think with regard to the North American market, the midsized enterprise segment team did a good job. We saw good results there. We're cautious about the potential in that segment, given their historic vulnerability to recession and macro exposure, but our team did well in Q2. I think the larger enterprise in those specific verticals were the ones where we saw the most substantive change in spending, and we expect them to be cautious go forward. Last year, from a year-on-year compare, last year public -- the high tech and service provider and the large enterprise segment did well for us. So this is a year-on-year compare, as well that we are working through. Angela Jin : Got it. And then for my follow-up, with the cloud ARR target lowered to $700 million, looking ahead to the out year, I'm not asking for you to predict how deep or long a potential downturn could be. But how are you thinking about risk to that $2 billion cloud ARR target by fiscal year '26. And what gives you confidence that you can accelerate ARR in those out years? Mike Berry : Hey Angela, it's Mike. So, as we both talked about, look, we still feel really good about the cloud business, both Cloud Storage and CloudOps. We have some things to work through this year. So even though Q2 was not where we would like, we still feel really good about the future. We will update our views of fiscal 2024 and the $2 billion when we give you guidance for next year. So we'll ask you to wait until we update our fiscal 2024 numbers in a couple of quarters. George Kurian : I think where we are focused on at the moment with our cloud business is to make sure that we are a good partner to our customers so that we can optimize their spend where they need help doing that. We are going to be continuing to accelerate our focus on selling more of our cloud products to our installed base where today it's about 15% of our Hybrid Cloud customers have our cloud products. And we have grown the number of cloud customers and the number of them that are buying more than one cloud service. So there's lots of opportunity ahead. We're focused on blocking and tackling and executing on the opportunities in front of us. Angela Jin : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Krish Sankar : Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them. I'll ask both of them upfront to either George or Mike. Thanks for the color on the cloud customer scenario. I'm kind of curious like one of your competitors just two weeks ago mentioned the storage demand is still pretty strong from cloud customers. I'm kind of curious, is the weakness you're seeing NetApp customer specific, or is there any share loss due to competitive threats? That's the first question. And then the follow-up is on the cloud ARR from $800 million to $700 million, yet we spoke about a high retention rate. So is the challenge now signing new customers with ANF? This is the ramp of AWS FSx? Any color there would be helpful on the ARR cut? Thank you. George Kurian : I think with regard to what we saw in the quarter was really we have unique cloud services, which are native, first party cloud services. Those are consumption offerings that we give customers. They were the ones most impacted. None of our competitors have native first-party consumption cloud services. They offer it through the marketplace. The marketplace business for us stayed relatively consistent. And so that is what you would expect. The subscription business is less susceptible to near-term changes in usage than the consumption business. And so the benefits of consumption being you can turn it on and off also shows up when customers want to optimize spend. We want to be a good partner to the customers that want to do that. And so we are working with our hyperscaler partners to give them access to more options to be more cost effective with their spend. Spot, which is the compute optimization platform actually did well in the quarter. So while the storage consumption was impacted by spend, as I noted in my remarks, Spot was a -- which is a vehicle to optimize computing spend did very well in the quarter. And so we continue to help our customers through that journey. With regard to growth opportunities, listen, as I said, we felt very good about the number of customer adds. We felt very good about the amount of cross-selling we are starting to see dollar-based net retention rate has been strong, and so several good things in our cloud business. Krish Sankar : And on the ARR side? Mike Berry : So on the ARR point, so there's been a couple of questions about the $800 million down to the $700 million. So when we looked at that, originally, when we had given the $800 million, we expect it to be, call it, somewhere around $650 million as of the end of Q2. Taking a look at the second half now, we expect to grow about $100 million. That's all organic because we don't have any acquisitions baked in. And we expect that to continue to grow across cloud storage, specifically ANF, FSx and GCP, we all expect to see some good growth. We have tried to be conservative or cautious, I will say, around the consumption business because we do expect that to come back in the second half. We're just not really sure if it's going to be Q3 or Q4. So we feel really good about the $700 million, still a significant growth in that business. But stepping it down a little bit based on the Q2 results and also take a step back a little bit on Cloud Insights. So that's the -- I'll call it, Krish, the product view of the rest of the year. Krish Sankar : Got it. Thanks a lot George. Thanks a lot Mike. A \u2013 George Kurian : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Q \u2013 Sidney Ho : Thanks for taking my question. Maybe a couple more on the public cloud side. So on the reported quarter, your public cloud revenue on an annualized basis was lower than your ARR exiting last quarter. Is it fair to say that there were some cancellations and maybe some restructuring of some of the deals based on the three dynamics that you guys talked about earlier. And if so, how do you feel comfortable about the future ARR would not be reduced from the churn level? And maybe I'll just throw in the next question here. If you look at your revised ARR for the $700 million, if I exclude the inorganic growth and then make some certain assumptions about dollar-based net retention, you still need quite a bit of ARR coming from new customers. So in terms of new customers, which offerings are you seeing the most traction at this point? Thank you. A \u2013 Mike Berry : Hey, Sidney, it's Mike. So let me do the first one. So great question. So we finished Q1 at $584 million in ARR. If you simply take -- divide that by four, you get about $146 million that you'd expect to recognize in revenue. The revenue recognized in the quarter was $142 million. And the nuance here is that typically, you can make -- you can do that calculation, it's going to flow very nicely because of the things that we talked about in terms of some of the consumption being reduced during the quarter, some of the project-based initiatives, especially the larger chip design wins. Those happened during the quarter. Thus, we did lose some revenue that was in the ARR as of the beginning of the quarter. So that's the nuance. We don't expect to see that happen in the future. It's a great question, but it was largely due to that. The third part is the back-ended linearity on some of the subscription business that follows the NetApp, I'll call it, core business as well. So it's really those three things attributed to that revenue coming in lower than simply taking the ARR divided by four. Q \u2013 Sidney Ho : Great. And in terms of the new customers -- ARR from new customers? A \u2013 George Kurian : Listen, we had a good quarter in terms of new customer additions. We have two major vehicles for new customer additions. The first being the native cloud services that we help our cloud provider partners, Amazon, Microsoft and Google sell for us. Those continue to be good vehicles for new customer additions. And then Spark has continued to be a strong vehicle for new customer additions. So I feel good about the pace of net new customers. Q \u2013 Sidney Ho : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question will come from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Q \u2013 Victor Chiu : This is Victor Chiu in for Simon Leopold. You noted several customers that concluded several large projects and then drove capacity reductions. Can you help clarify what changed versus your expectations exactly because the way that you kind of described at the conclusions were kind of natural and then so we assumed it would have been somewhat expected. So, either did they conclude earlier? I think you mentioned there was some chip design kind of timing-related issues. Can you just help us clarify why this dynamic was not expected? George Kurian : Listen, I think we have seen in the past projects get concluded in a quarter and other projects get started up within the same quarter or by other customers within the quarter. This time, we saw some particularly large projects that concluded in the quarter where the start of the next project is beyond the finish of the quarter and further out than we would like. So, I think that was the nature of what happened in the quarter. I think the -- would honestly want to get better visibility. We are working on that. I think this is when we have another partner selling the service to the end customer. Our sales teams are working to get better visibility into the end customers kind of priorities and spending time lines. So that's on us. We can do better on that, and I promise that. Victor Chiu : Okay. And then just quickly, regarding your commentary on macro headwinds, are you observing explicit behavioral trends or having explicit discussions with customers that makes you confident that the slowing is specific to the macro environment versus a more secular shift like accelerating workload migrations to the public cloud? George Kurian : I think we are closely engaged with a large number of the enterprise customers through our direct sales force in the midsized enterprise market, as you know, we go to market with the channel providers. In terms of the customer behavior we saw in the quarter, it is very reflective of a typical macro cycle, more approvals for deals, smaller deal sizes, projects being broken up into phases rather than one large purchase and some deals moving out of the quarter. That did not mean that other customers did not start projects with us and move them forward. We know that those projects are -- that we did not lose share to somebody else because we are in ongoing dialogue around the other phases of the projects that are yet to come online. Victor Chiu : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. I just wanted to get a sense of whether we could get what the size of Hi-tech and service provider is as a percentage of the cloud revenue or just kind of any vertical concentration that we should be mindful of? And then maybe last quarter, you had given kind of the storage services as a percentage of cloud ARR. If we could just have an update there, that would be helpful as well. Thanks, George Kurian : Yes. Listen, Meta, we're not going to break out specific verticals. I would just say that we saw a broad-based -- hi-tech is quite a broad segment, and we saw a fairly conservative posture across that segment. Service provider could -- is also broadly defined. It could be telco. It could be hosting provider. It could be some form of cloud providers. So, these are broader categories than a very specific definition. And we saw a fairly conservative postures across most of those customers. Mike Berry : Amy [ph], it's Mike. On your second question, so two data points for you. Cloud storage continues to be almost exactly 60% of the total and that includes, as of the end of Q2, Instaclustr and CloudCheckr which are in CloudOps. So there you see the great growth we've seen in cloud storage because overall, as a total number has stayed right around 60%. The other important number is we've talked about consumption versus subscription. As of the end of Q2, it's pretty close to 50-50, a little bit a couple of percentage points higher for consumption. We do expect by the end of the year with that $700 million for that to get much closer to 60%, because that's where we expect the growth across ANF, GCP and FSx, those products as well. So those are the two data points we gave you that break down that cloud ARR number. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks, so much. Mike Berry : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead. Ananda Baruah : Hi, thanks guys for taking the question. Actually two clarifications, if I could. Mike, just the remarks you made a couple of times in the prepared comments about and this is really the clarification. FX driving sort of some portion of the guide down or whatever that context was. Could you clarify that that? And then I have a quick follow-up clarification as well. Mike Berry : Sure, Ananda. Happy to. So that was in reference to on the Q1 call, we had given -- this is directly related to EPS. We've given $5.50 as the midpoint. Since that time, because of the continued strengthening of the dollar and the weakening of the FX situation, the $5.40 is actually above what that number would have been on an FX-adjusted basis, that's about $5.37. The point there being, hey, we're seeing even in the second half with the lower outlook around revenue, we're doing all we can around costs and other efficiencies to ensure that we continue to still drive that EPS number consistent with the number we gave you last time on the call. Ananda Baruah : I got it. That's super helpful. And then, the second clarification is, to one of the questions, you mentioned, you gave some context around timing of pickup and something along -- well, it was sort of -- that was sort of the gist of it. But I think, Mike, the comments you made, where you expect demand to come back in the second half, though you weren't sure it was Q3 or Q4. Could you clarify that? And is it -- is it fiscal Q3, Q4, or is it calendar '23 Q3, Q4 in addition to the clarification. Thanks. Mike Berry : Sure. So I've been trained and I only talk about fiscal year, calendar years. So this was second half fiscal, and that was directly related to the cloud ARR growth. So we finished at $603 million. We've guided end of year to $700 million. We are not going to guide Q3. We feel good about the second half because again, these are some of those -- these large project-based as well as consumption. When does that flow in? Is it in our fiscal Q3 or Q4? We feel confident about the second half. There's a little bit of nuance around whether it's three or four, hence, we're only doing the end of the year. Ananda Baruah : That's super helpful. And so, was that the same, like, that anecdotally, you guys are experiencing, and George, feel free to jump in on this too, anecdotally, you guys are -- you're experiencing a little bit of a sideways here, call it, a pause. You anticipate that it's going to last, I guess, like in period of max six months, eight months, let's say starts slowing mid-quarter, could last an additional six months But you do expect then pickup in some context after that. Anecdotally, is that the gist of what you guys are communicating? Mike Berry : Well, keep in mind, Ananda, all this is related to the cloud ARR. This is not the Hybrid Cloud. And this is more of just us talking about when we expect it to come back in the second half. And again, because of the large project base, that's really the nuance on this more than anything versus us calling, hey, we expect to see things pick up after April. Ananda Baruah : Got it, got it, got it. Okay, cool. Thanks guys. Appreciate it. Mike Berry : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Jim Suva : Thank you. Good afternoon. George, on your outlook and Mike, on your outlook, you mentioned about slowing economic comments, which is understood. Any thoughts around inventory digestion, is there a sense that there's inventory digestion out there. And if so, how long or any double ordering, or is it just purely economic pausing and elongation of cycles? George Kurian : We did not see any order cancellations or any of those things. As we have mentioned repeatedly, we have good line of sight into our customer\u2019s spending priorities and behaviors and are directly engaged with the largest of them. I think as we saw in this quarter, and we continue to be cautious about looking at the second half of the year. These are clearly related to IT budget revisions, right, where they are reducing deal sizes or scrutinizing projects and things, we'll defer a portion of that project to a subsequent quarter or a subsequent part of the calendar year. So we have good visibility into the activities in our customers, and we did not see cancellations of orders because of prior orders or double ordering. Jim Suva : Great. Thanks. But on the inventory digestion, any thoughts of -- were there any inventory that's still being digested that may allow corporate or service providers to prolong these revisions, or is any concern about inventory out there? George Kurian : Typically, during macro situations like these, we have seen customers sweat their assets. And so what we mean by that is they will drive a system to a higher level of utilization and so that they can defer either capacity augmentation or system upgrades for a period of time. Now that's not forever, right? Storage is consumed because data keeps growing. And so there's always that trade-off. We certainly see some of that behavior going on. Jim, I think, certainly in our service provider segment, we see that. And in some of the hi-tech verticals, we saw that as well. Jim Suva : Great. Thank you so much for the details and clarifications. George Kurian : Yeah. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Tim Long with Barclays. Please go ahead. George Wang : It's actually George Wang on for Tim Long. I have two questions. Firstly, George, maybe you can elaborate on the current state of deal integration in terms of Spot, Instaclustr. And any thought process behind the following deal until FY 2024? George Kurian : Listen, we have a good portfolio of technologies already. And what we are really focused on is sharpening the use cases that are best suited to the current macro environment and making those use cases easy for the customers to adopt, expand and renew, right? And that operational focus is our highest priority. There are some -- there's work to be done to integrate the CloudCheckr capabilities into the Spot suite so that it becomes one broader offering rather than two parallel offerings. We have made good progress along the way, but there's more work to be done. In Instaclustr, there are two unique value adds that we bring. One is the integration of our cloud storage services and Spot services into Instaclustr. And the second is the fact that it is a truly open-source data services platform. We have the first of those two being worked. And so we feel like there's a lot of value we already have in our portfolio. There's work to be completed, and we want to keep our teams focused on that work on the technology side. On the go-to-market side, we also have more broad enablement and training for our sales teams to be able to position Spot and Instaclustr and CloudCheckr into the account. So we feel good about the work we're doing. We got to finish it before we look at other things. Q \u2013 George Wang : Okay. Cool. Yeah, a quick follow-up is on the cost cuts. Maybe you can elaborate on the kind of disaggregate just components for the cost cuts, whether that's sales and marketing, the SG&A or kind of some of the R&D? Any color would be appreciated. A \u2013 Mike Berry : Hey, George, it's Mike. And just I want to make sure your question was the -- what are we looking at for cost reductions in the second half? Was that the question? Q \u2013 George Wang : Yes. A \u2013 Mike Berry : Perfect. Thank you. So there's several that I think you're going to see flow through the P&L. I'm going to start all the way at the top, which is we do expect to finally see some relief from our significant expenditures related to premiums. The supply chain is getting a little bit better. It gets better every day. So that's going to help the second half. In addition, NAND pricing will help us as well. Now we do have a little bit of inventory to work through. And you'll see that still in Q3, but we expect by Q4, you'll see that as well. On the OpEx side, we're -- George talked about and we've already done a headcount freeze. We're taking a look at all discretionary spending, including travel, programs, outside services, just like everybody else who has embraced the hybrid work environment. We'll take a hard look at our facilities costs as well. So we've already started down the path on several of those as I talked about, hey, we'll continue to look at those as we go into the second half. So there's numerous areas for us to focus on. In addition, keep in mind, too, that in OpEx, there's a good bit of that cost structure related to incentive comp and commissions. And certainly, those will come down in the second half as well. Q \u2013 George Wang : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Q \u2013 Nehal Chokshi : Yeah. Thanks. So -- the total revenue guidance is lowered by 400 basis points that characterizes 100 basis points due to incremental FX, another 100 basis points due to lower PCS ARR target. And then the remaining 200 basis points either due to weaker billings results on a constant currency basis during the quarter, or is it a weaker billings result that has started to transpire during the third quarter, again, on a constant currency basis? A \u2013 Mike Berry : So for the second half, Nehal, that is mostly related to product revenue, which would be largely booked and recognized in the quarter. So it's -- there's -- backlog is largely at the normal rates, the seasonal normal rates that we would expect. So that is going to be systems in the second half, I think, is the third part of your question. Nehal Chokshi : Excellent. Okay. And then dollar-based net revenue retention rate declined quite significantly, 192 to 140. Is this largely because of the project-related stuff? George Kurian : Dollar-based net revenue retention was 150 last quarter, and it's now 140. So, step down as the base of customers expand, and we did see some churn in our consumption business, as we noted on our call, so we don't see that as materially different than what we would expect. Mike Berry : And to George's point, Nehal, we've been calling that for several quarters, which is add that ARR number gets bigger, that dollar-based net retention percentage will come down. We like to call it the 120, 130, where we think it will land, but we have been calling that percentage to continue to decline as that number increases. Nehal Chokshi : That you have. Okay. And then just finally, Mike, the PCS GM did come down both Q-on-Q and year-over-year. Why is that? George Kurian : The PCS gross margin came down because of the revenue scale relative to the infrastructure that we have deployed. Note that the consumption business, some elements of those are based on our deployed systems, right, in the cloud provider environments. And when they have less scale, you see less utilization, you see less gross margin. Mike Berry : It came down from 69.7% to 68.3%, so down slightly. And to George's point, that's largely due to scale. We continue to feel good, as I mentioned in my notes about the 75% to 80% as we drive that scale. Nehal Chokshi : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you. I appreciate the fiscal year guide. But George, you were talking earlier about IT budgets and some caution around that. I was wondering if you could share some color on what you're hearing from customers more around calendar 2023 IT budgets? And what's your view on how you expect the storage market to grow in 2023 and your growth relative to that? And I have a follow-up. George Kurian : I think with regard to 2023, we're being cautious we aren\u2019t guiding next fiscal year, but we are being cautious about the start to calendar year 2023. We have seen typically in these macro situations that new budget outlays to start a calendar year probably take longer than typical. So, we've been cautious about the start of the new calendar year. With regard to the storage market overall, I think it's going to be paced by new workload deployments. I think there will be customers that will be forced to upgrade systems because their existing systems are coming to either end of useful life or end of they're just out of capacity or performance. But I think the majority will prioritize new workload deployments and/or system consolidation for cost and energy benefit use cases. We continue to see -- while the cloud migrations are slowing down a bit, we continue to see that as a long-term trend that customers are going to take on for a whole bunch of reasons. And so I think cloud will outpace on-prem in the broader market. And in the on-prem world, we see NAND helping flash be a bigger part of the mix going forward. Our capacity flash products had a good quarter, our hybrid flash products had a good quarter, they are typical about where customers are cost conscious. Wamsi Mohan : Okay. That's helpful, George. And just a follow-up on your last comment about the NAND market. Every few years, you see the significant dislocation in pricing and this one is quite severe. You guys noted the benefit that you will recognize in gross margin terms. But can you just remind us on how you're thinking about the impact to revenues based on the NAND price decline? Are you expecting a deceleration in AFA revenues, or are you expecting elasticity of demand to offset that? Thank you. George Kurian : Customers' budget in dollars, the current macro environment has been spending less dollars, but they'll probably shift the mix to AFAs, if there's more value in the offering, right? So we see them budget in dollars, Wamsi. Wamsi Mohan : Okay. But in aggregate terms, would you say that the customer budgets would be up or down like in full in aggregate, whether it's cloud on-prem, all put together? George Kurian : I think overall, year-on-year, I think '23, we expect to be moderated and down relative to '22, certainly at the start of the year. '22 had a good start to the year. And so our start of the new calendar year, which is baked into our outlook for the second half of fiscal year, we think people are going to be more cautious overall, Wamsi. Wamsi Mohan : Okay. Thank you so much, George. George Kurian : Yes, thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much for taking my question. I was just wondering what you're hearing from customers on your Keystone offering. I think, as a service offerings, they are becoming a bit more attractive in an economic downturn. So I'm wondering what kind of traction you're seeing there? George Kurian : It's early, but good traction. We are focused with a few channel partners who are enabled on selling Keystone. We've had good customer wins, good momentum in terms of our offerings. We brought new innovation to market in the last quarter, both a unified control plane so that you can use either a Keystone-based consumption offering in your environment or our public cloud offerings, and you can move workloads and licenses across those. So a good amount of innovation. And you're correct, we'll continue to see opportunities to help customers around whatever their kind of buying model is in this environment. Shannon Cross : Great and thanks. And I look forward to seeing you on Thursday at our conference. Mike Berry : I as well look forward to seeing on Thursday. Operator : Our final question will come from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Kyle McNealy : Hey good afternoon. Thanks very much for the question. You touched on this a bit earlier, but not directly. But does the budget scrutiny that you're seeing right now from some subset of customers' impact their decisions for provisioning the mix that they're provisioning of all-flash versus hybrid arrays at least for new projects. And I know you mentioned that our all-flash portfolio has leading cost efficiency, but do you expect the mindset to change on how much customers are willing to embrace more all-flash? Will the pockets of slowdown that you're seeing potentially pull everything back and the mix stays relatively on the same trajectory? Thanks. George Kurian : I think -- thank you for the question. We didn't see customer\u2019s sort of reevaluating technical decisions about what type of infrastructure to buy. I think that allowed the technical team to choose what was the most value, and they make decisions based on the relative cost effectiveness of disk versus flash. I think what we saw was an approval level going up for the same deal what would have been approved by a director, now got taken up to VP what was approved by VP, probably goes up to a CTO. That is what elongated deal cycles in the quarter and/or people shrinking how much they wanted to buy at one time and phasing projects into multiple phases. Kyle McNealy : Okay. Thanks very much. That\u2019s helpful. Kris Newton : All right. Thank you, Kyle. I'm going to give it back to George for a couple of closing thoughts. George Kurian : While there are near-term economic challenges for every company, we know that our opportunity ahead is substantial, durable and growing. The fundamentals of our business are strong and the value we bring customers is undeniable. Our strategic growth opportunities all-flash arrays, cloud storage and cloud infrastructure optimization are tightly aligned to customers' top priority and represent the potential for long-term sustained and profitable growth. We will continue to be disciplined stewards of the business, focusing on our strategic growth opportunities while continually optimizing our operating costs to drive shareholder value. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Newton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kris Newton : Hi everyone. Thanks for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian, and CFO, Mike Berry. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com. During today\u2019s call we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, such as our guidance for fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023; our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability, and shareholder returns; our alignment with the secular growth trends of data-driven digital and cloud transformations; our expectations regarding the future growth in the number of cloud customers, their usage of cloud services and the resulting impact on our Public Cloud and Hybrid Cloud segments; our ability to deliver innovation, sharpen our execution and focus on our strategic growth opportunities while optimizing our operating costs; and our ability to strengthen our position, rebalance our sales and marketing efforts and drive sustained growth in both our Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud segments in a turbulent macroeconomic environment, all of which involve risk and uncertainty. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. Actual results may differ materially for a variety of reasons, including macroeconomic and market conditions such as the IT capital spending environment, including the focus on optimization of cloud spending; inflation, rising interest rates and foreign exchange volatility; and the continuing impact and uneven recovery of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the resulting supply chain disruptions; as well as our ability to keep pace with the rapid industry, technological and market trends and changes in the markets in which we operate, execute our evolved cloud strategy and introduce and gain market acceptance for our products and services, maintain our customer, partner, supplier and contract manufacturer relationships on favorable terms and conditions, manage material cybersecurity and other security breaches, and manage our gross profit margins and generate greater cash flow. Please also refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC, and available on our website, specifically our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q including in the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Risk Factors sections. During the call all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are posted on our website. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to George. George Kurian : Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. In Q3, we executed well on the elements under our control in the face of a weakening IT spending environment and continued cloud cost optimization. Disciplined operational management yielded operating margin and EPS that exceeded expectations, despite revenue coming in at the low end of our guidance. We are delivering on our commitments and responding to the dynamic environment. We adjusted our cost structure, introduced a portfolio of capacity-flash arrays to support cost sensitive customers, and continue to work with our customers to help them optimize their cloud spending. On today\u2019s call, I will discuss our Q3 results in the context of the current environment and our plans to sharpen our execution to accelerate near-term results and enhance our long-term position. We continued to see increased budget scrutiny, requiring higher level approvals, which resulted in smaller deal sizes, longer selling cycles, and some deals pushing out. We are feeling this most acutely in large enterprise and the Americas tech and service provider sectors. Customers are looking to stretch their budget dollars, sweating assets, shifting spend to hybrid flash and capacity flash arrays from higher-cost performance flash arrays and, as our cloud partners have described, optimizing cloud spending. We saw signs of a softening environment early in fiscal year \u201823 and took swift action to control costs, with increased scrutiny of program spending, a hiring slowdown in Q2, and a hiring freeze in Q3. At the start of Q4, we implemented a workforce reduction of approximately 8%. Decisions that impact our employees are always difficult. I take great pride in fostering the NetApp culture and am committed to using this difficult action to refocus our team, guided by the values and mission of the Company. Our hybrid flash and QLC-based all-flash arrays continue to perform well, benefiting from customers\u2019 price sensitivity in this challenging macro. The shift from high-performance all-flash arrays to lower cost solutions, coupled with the lower spending environment, especially among large enterprise, and U.S. tech and service provider customers who are large consumers of flash, created headwinds to our product and all-flash array revenues. In Q3, our all-flash array business decreased 12% from Q3 a year ago to an annualized revenue run rate of $2.8 billion. Public Cloud ARR of $605 million did not meet our expectations, driven by a shortfall in cloud storage as a result of the same factors we experienced last quarter. Spending optimization and the winding down of project-based workloads like chip design, EDA, and HPC were headwinds again in Q3. We have a sizable base of public cloud customers, with a number of large customers who have grown rapidly over the past year and are now optimizing. Their cost optimizations mask the growth of other customers. We continue to add new customers and churn has remained consistently low. Overall, the CloudOps portfolio performed to plan. Cloud Insights has stabilized, and Spot continues to grow nicely, benefiting from the cost optimization trend. Our dollar-based net revenue retention rate decreased to 120% but is still within healthy industry norms. We are confident that we remain well positioned to take advantage of the secular growth trends of data-driven digital and cloud transformations. We are aligned to customers\u2019 top priorities and have demonstrated success in controlling the elements within our control. Building on that solid foundation, we are sharpening our execution to accelerate near-term results while strengthening our position for when the spending environment rebounds. We have three areas of focus : First, we will remain prudent stewards of the business and will continue to tightly manage the elements within our control. Second, we are reinvigorating efforts across the Company in support of our storage business. Third, we are building a more focused approach to our Public Cloud business. Starting with the first area of focus, remaining prudent stewards of the business and managing the elements within our control. We will maintain our focus on cost controls so that expenses do not grow ahead of revenue. We will achieve this by maintaining our scrutiny on program spending and hiring, as well as focusing our investments on the products that represent the biggest opportunity. We\u2019ve made difficult decisions to reduce investment in products with smaller revenue potential like Astra Data Store and SolidFire. The results of this focus are visible in our ability to maintain our free cash flow, operating margin, and EPS guidance despite lower revenue. On to the second focus area, reinvigorating our storage business. As we moved rapidly to embrace cloud, we lost some momentum in our Hybrid Cloud business. We are taking decisive action to strengthen our position and performance by better addressing the areas of market growth, delivering more customer value, and realigning our go-to-market activities to better address this opportunity. We were slow to fully embrace the customer desire for lower-cost, capacity-oriented all-flash systems. At the start of Q4, we rectified that situation with the introduction of the AFF C-Series, the most comprehensive, industry-leading portfolio of QLC-based all-flash arrays that addresses a wide range of workloads and price points. These products will help customers manage through a cost sensitive environment while, at the same time, supporting their pursuit of sustainability targets. Initial response has been very positive, and we are already quoting deals for customers. The AFF C-Series will drive AFA revenue and support product gross margin as customers rotate from lower margin hybrid flash to all-flash systems. In addition to expanding our product portfolio, we\u2019ve introduced a number of innovations to improve the customer experience and bring predictability to their investment process. In Q3, we released BlueXP, a unified control plane that helps decrease resource waste, complexity, and the risk of managing diverse environments. As a part of our sustainability commitment, we\u2019re previewing a new dashboard in BlueXP to help customers understand their data center carbon footprint across environments. Early in Q4, we introduced NetApp Advance, a best-in-class portfolio of programs and guarantees, which is already helping us win new customers and drive revenue. We are rebalancing our sales and marketing efforts to better address the significant storage market opportunity, including aligning compensation plans to drive sales of our reinvigorated storage portfolio. We believe that these actions will enable us to drive product revenue growth and regain share in the all-flash array market. Finally, our third area of focus, building a more focused approach to cloud. While we are reinvigorating our storage business, we have no intention of taking our foot off the pedal in Public Cloud. It represents a huge growth opportunity for us with a gross margin profile that is accretive to the business. Additionally, our Public Cloud Services are highly differentiated, with a multiyear advantage over our traditional competitors, and create customer preference for NetApp. We have sharpened the focus in our CloudOps portfolio and have taken actions that could have future revenue and ARR implications. We believe that our CloudOps services will continue to deliver stable, steady growth over the long term. Our customer success team has made good progress in driving utilization of our CloudOps services, but we need to do more with our cloud storage and data services. Additionally, we recognize that we have not been using our go-to-market resources to their best effect here. In addition to refocusing our sales team on the reinvigorated storage portfolio, we are identifying ways to most effectively align our sales resources to the buying centers and consumption models for all our solutions. Our cloud storage business is predominately consumption-based and largely driven by our hyperscaler partners. These factors, coupled with the current cloud cost-optimization environment have impacted our ability to forecast ARR. However, as we grow the business, the impact from a subset of customers will be mitigated, smoothing its growth and improving predictability. I want to underscore my confidence in this opportunity. The migration of enterprise applications, like SAP and VMware, to the cloud, as well as cloud-native applications, like artificial intelligence, create a massive market in which we can grow. We believe strongly that Public Cloud services can be a multibillion-dollar ARR business for us. However, achieving that target will take longer than we initially planned due to the industry-wide slowdown in cloud spending and our recent performance. In closing, we have seen tangible success from our efforts to manage the elements within our control in a challenging environment. Despite our lowered revenue outlook, we have preserved free cash flow and EPS expectations. In the first three fiscal quarters of this year, we have returned over $1 billion to shareholders and reduced share count by 4%. We are sharpening our execution to accelerate near-term results and enhance our position for the long-term. We are taking these steps now, so that, as we begin FY24, we are in a new, more focused operating model to attack the opportunity ahead, drive growth, and deliver shareholder value. Before turning the call over to Mike, I want to give my thanks to the NetApp team for their operational discipline and rapid response to set us up for better results. I have seen first-hand how hard they are working to navigate the challenging environment and I really appreciate their efforts. Mike Berry : Thank you, George. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we go through the financial details, I think it would be valuable to reiterate the key themes for today\u2019s discussion that George highlighted. Number one, despite the temporary headwinds to revenue, our disciplined operational management yielded op margin and EPS above the high-end of guidance. Number two, the macro backdrop and demand environment continue to be major headwinds. The weakening IT spending environment was most pronounced in our large enterprise and U.S. technology and service provider customers and materially impacted our all-flash revenue in Q3, while significant cloud optimization across all three major hyperscalers continued to weigh heavily on ARR growth. Although the U.S. dollar weakened slightly during Q3, FX continues to be a material headwind to our financial results on a year-over-year basis. Number three, as we navigate through this fluid demand environment, we remain laser focused on driving operating margins and free cash flow generation. Towards this end, we took swift action in Q3 to control costs through increased program spending scrutiny and a hiring freeze. And at the start of Q4, we implemented a reduction in force of approximately 8%. In addition to adjusting our own cost structure, we also introduced C-Series, a portfolio of QLC capacity-flash arrays to support cost sensitive datacenter customers, and we continued to work with our cloud customers to help optimize their spending. And number four, as a result of our disciplined cost management, we are reiterating our full-year EPS guide of $5.30 to $5.50. We are also confident in our free cash flow target of $1.1 billion, adjusting for the restructuring and one-time cash tax payment in Q4. From a capital allocation perspective, we remain committed to returning more than 100% of fiscal \u201823 free cash flow to investors through dividends and share repurchases. Now to the details. As a reminder, I\u2019ll be referring to non-GAAP numbers unless otherwise noted. Q3 billings were $1.57 billion, down 11% year-over-year. Revenue came in at $1.53 billion, down 5% year-over-year. Adjusting for the 340 basis-point headwind from FX, billings and revenue would have been down 7% and 2% year-over-year, respectively. Even with the challenging Q3, our cloud portfolio continues to positively impact the overall revenue growth profile of NetApp. Hybrid Cloud segment revenue of $1.38 billion was down 9% year-over-year. Product revenue of $682 million decreased 19% year-over-year, as customers took a decidedly cautious approach to capital spending. Total Q3 recurring support revenue of $616 million increased 5% year-over-year, highlighting the health of our installed base. Public Cloud ARR exited Q3 at $605 million, up 29% year-over-year. Public Cloud revenue recognized in the quarter was $150 million, up 36% year-over-year and 6% sequentially. As highlighted by our three major hyperscaler partners, customers continue to optimize their cloud spend as organizations are exercising caution, given the macroeconomic uncertainty. While the timing of the recovery remains unclear, we are confident the secular trends of AI, machine learning, IoT and high-performance computing, along with the migration of enterprise apps like VMware & SAP, will drive long-term growth in cloud storage consumption. Recurring support and Public Cloud revenue of $766 million was up 10% year-over-year, constituting 50% of total revenue. We ended Q3 with $4.2 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 6% year-over-year. Q3 marks the 20th consecutive quarter of year-over-year deferred revenue growth, which is the best leading indicator for recurring revenue growth. Total gross margin was 67% in Q3, in line with our guidance. Total Hybrid Cloud gross margin was also 67% in Q3. Within our Hybrid Cloud segment, product gross margin was 46.5%, including a 2-point year-over-year headwind from FX. As noted, our large enterprise and U.S. tech and service provider customers have continued to reduce CapEx spend as they right-size their spending envelops. These customers are the most forward leaning technology adopters and the biggest consumers of all-flash systems in the economy, and their pause in CapEx spending has had a material impact on our total revenue, all-flash mix and product margins. And while the supply chain component premiums and NAND pricing notably improved in Q3, we had to work through higher-cost inventory during the quarter. We expect the improving supply chain and NAND pricing to be a tailwind to product margin in Q4 and fiscal \u201824. Our growing recurring support business continues to be very profitable, with gross margin of 93%. Public Cloud gross margin of 69% was accretive to the corporate average for the ninth consecutive quarter. We remain confident in our long-term Public Cloud gross margin goal of 75% to 80%, as the business scales and an increasing percentage of our Public Cloud revenue is driven by cloud and software solutions. While revenue came in at the low-end of guidance, Q3 highlighted our operational discipline and cost controls, with operating margin of 24%, including 2-points of FX headwinds. EPS of $1.37 came in above the high-end of guidance and included $0.14 of year-over-year FX headwind. Cash flow from operations was $377 million and free cash flow was $319 million. Inventory turns increased to 12 in Q3, up from 9 in Q2, as supply chain challenges eased in the quarter, enabling us to take down inventory by nearly $70 million sequentially. During Q3, we repurchased $200 million in stock and paid out $108 million in cash dividends. In total, we returned $308 million to shareholders, representing 97% of free cash flow. Share count of 219 million was down 4% year-over-year. We closed Q3 with $3.1 billion in cash and short-term investments, up $108 million sequentially. Now to guidance. As George discussed, we have seen continued softening in the macro backdrop, with customers taking a decidedly cautious approach to spending. We now expect fiscal \u201923 revenue to be roughly flat year-over-year, which includes 3 to 4 percentage points of FX headwind. In fiscal \u201823, we continue to expect gross margin to range between 66% and 67%, as elevated component costs and FX headwinds weigh on product margins. While the timing is uncertain, we remain confident that our structural product margins will normalize back to the mid-50s in the fullness of time, particularly when you factor in our new C-Series portfolio, which will largely displace lower margin hybrid spinning disk systems in our product mix. Given our disciplined cost controls, we are raising our fiscal \u201823 operating margin guidance. We now expect op margin to range between 23% and 24%, which includes approximately 2 points of FX headwind. Last quarter, we committed to protecting both, EPS and free cash flow during this uncertain macro environment. Today, we are reiterating our full-year EPS guide of $5.30 to $5.50, which includes $0.54 of currency impacts. We also continue to expect to generate $1.1 billion in free cash flow, excluding one-time items. From a capital allocation perspective, we remain committed to returning more than 100% of fiscal \u201923 free cash flow to investors through dividends and share repurchases. Now on to Q4 guidance. We expect Q4 net revenues to range between $1.475 billion and $1.625 billion which, at the midpoint, implies an 8% decrease year-over-year, or a 6% decrease in constant currency. In this macro environment, we expect customers to continue to optimize their cloud spend at our three major hyperscaler partners. As a result, we expect cloud revenue and ARR to be approximately flat sequentially in Q4. Please note, as we head into fiscal \u201824, we plan to anchor our cloud segment guidance on revenue dollars, instead of ARR. To be clear, we will continue to disclose cloud ARR as a key metric as we go through the year. We expect consolidated gross margin to be approximately 67%. As we head into Q4, we are forecasting a material reduction in component premiums, decreasing NAND costs, and engineering product efficiencies. As such, we are confident that product margins will rise in Q4. These trends also position us nicely heading into fiscal \u201824 to drive leverage through our business model, particularly as customers begin to reengage on all-flash capacity buildouts and customers mix shift away from hybrid spinning disk systems to new QLC all-flash solutions. While the exact timing is unclear, large enterprise and U.S. tech and service provider customers are the largest consumers of data and storage in the global economy and our all-flash ONTAP systems are structurally linked to their data growth cross cycle. In Q4, we expect operating margin to range between 23% and 24%. We anticipate our tax-rate to be approximately 21%. We are forecasting earnings per share for Q4 to range between $1.30 and $1.40 per share. Assumed in our Q4 guidance is net interest income of $7.5 million and a share count of approximately 218 million. In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for their continued commitment in such an uncertain economic environment. I\u2019ll now hand it back to Kris to open the call for Q&A. Kris? Kris Newton : Thanks Mike. Operator, let\u2019s begin the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Thanks for taking my question. I guess the first one I had was if I think about the delta and cloud ARR from $700 million last quarter that we were expecting to maybe $605 million range right now, how much of the delta or the drop, if you may, is due to macro issues versus something that might be more company-specific? Is there a way to parse that out? And then do you see the resumption of growth happening in '24 as you go forward? George Kurian : I think the broad themes that we saw were shared across all of the hyperscalers and across a broad range of customers. We continue to see good numbers of new customer additions to our cloud storage offerings. Even though the impact in the quarter from there being acquired is lower, we had -- we saw no changes to the churn in our cloud storage business, but we did see optimization, meaning movement of capacity from higher cost, more high-performance levels to lower cost, lower performance levels. And there was no predictable pattern in terms of what types of customers. As we noted last quarter, we also saw some reductions in spending from customers who wrapped up projects with us. So, I will just say this is part of normal cloud behavior and consumption. We feel good about the additions. We feel good about our engagement with customers. And we feel good about the fact that we continue to broaden the number of use cases and customer value propositions we can address that should benefit us moving forward with a more focused route-to-market approach for cloud as well. Amit Daryanani : Got it. And could I spend maybe 60 seconds on the gross margin dynamics into April quarter? I think you\u2019re essentially saying, I think, gross margins are flat, up 20 basis points sequentially, but that's despite the fact you have a little bit of revenue leverage. And then it sounds like NAND pricing and commodity pricing broadly is coming down. So, I would have thought gross margins could be up a bit more maybe in the April quarter. So maybe you can just talk about the puts and takes on the gross margin line, that'd be super helpful. Thank you. Mike Berry : Sure. Amit, it's Mike. So, I'll do both, Hybrid Cloud just in a little bit of cloud margins as well. So on Hybrid Cloud, what we really saw was if you go back to the two big drivers that we saw in the business, one is with our lower spending in U.S. strategic large enterprise. They are the largest purveyors of all-flash. So, we saw all-flash dollar and mix come down. In addition, we've talked about seeing lower capacity, i.e., folks buying less terabytes per system. That happened within both, flash and hybrid. So, those two added together brought our margins down in Q3. We didn't really see a benefit on NAND or premiums yet. This is hopefully the last time I'm going to say this on a call because we fully expect in Q4 that to finally start to realize in the P&L, we will see the benefits of a lot lower premiums. And finally, the lower cost NAND as we work through the inventory will roll through the P&L. So, we feel good about the gross margin projection in the April quarter being at least 50%. And then cloud margins, hey, it's really dependent more than anything on scale. We feel good about getting to the mid-70s as we scale that business, but we do need to drive higher revenue. So hopefully, that helps. Operator : The next question will come from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead. David Vogt : Maybe, George, I just want to go back to your comment that you mentioned that you lost some momentum in Hybrid Cloud. Just wanted to drill down on that comment. Can you maybe elaborate on a little bit more specifically, what did you mean by that? Obviously, it's a key driver of the business and an important cash flow engine, but just would love to get some more color on that. And then I have a follow-up. Thanks. George Kurian : I think there are three elements of that. I think the first, we have been a little bit later than we would have liked to introduce lower cost more value-oriented capacity flash arrays. We've corrected that. We feel really good about the early interest in our C-Series. The second was that we have moved resources to the more stable, steady growth parts of the market, like the commercial market and lower parts of the enterprise from the cyclical large enterprise segment. We haven't done as much as we need to, and we'll continue to do that heading forward. And the third is that from a compensation and goal alignment perspective, we're going to sharply focus certain parts of our field organization to drive our flash portfolio while aligning other parts of our field organization to focus on the cloud business. David Vogt : Got it. And then maybe just a follow-up to that is, so typically, what is the lead time, or how does the cycle -- or the sales cycle work from, let's say, start to traction for these initiatives? Should we expect sort of a recovery in, let's say, the second half of fiscal '24 in these particular markets driven by the strategy, or does it take a little bit longer or maybe shorter to see some tangible benefits? Thank you. George Kurian : I think, first of all, we are excited about the C-Series products. They will be available this quarter. I think the material impact of those product portfolios will be in the first half of next fiscal year. The large enterprise segment will continue to be a place of caution for us. I think that we will need -- we are working with our customers to understand their buying behavior. My sense is that -- and my hope is that they are back buying more aggressively than they have been in the second part of next fiscal year. So, we hope that -- the product portfolio is in the market this quarter. Commercial and lower-end parts of the enterprise should see some benefits from that in the first half of next fiscal year. But the large enterprise segment, we're a bit more cautious about. And your expectation is more accurate around second half of next fiscal year is our hope. Operator : Next question will come from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Please go ahead. Steven Fox : Just following up on those last comments around the commercial versus large enterprise. I guess, how do we think about just sort of a pivot back so that you prepared for the cycle? Like what are you looking for in order to maybe have the right resources ready for when the large enterprises do come back and you need to be prepared to service them in a more aggressive manner? And then, I had a follow-up. George Kurian : We are very closely engaged with these customers. We've known them for decades. I think the fundamental pattern is the improvements in their business prospects. So, as soon as they see that, they start the discussions with us on purchasing. Steven Fox : Okay. That's helpful. And then, just in terms of the benefits now with NAND and other component costs low, can you just talk about -- give us a sense for how much of your sales are benefiting from the low-cost NAND in this current quarter? And how much more there would be to go before you like at 100% of where NAND prices are? Thanks. Mike Berry : So this quarter, on the low cost NAND it's not a big number, Steve, in this quarter. We do expect that that will be a significant contributor going into fiscal '24. I would just say, take a step back on the margin side. There are two significant drivers to our optimism as we look at product margins in '24. One is the premiums. We've talked about that. It's about $50 million a quarter. It is a material improvement going into next year. NAND, as we all know, has come down materially every quarter since in the last three quarters. We're finally going to be able to realize in our P&L as we got -- as we move through the high-cost inventory. And then you talked about the mix, that will also benefit product margins going into next year. And then goodness, hopefully, FX also helped. So, I would add all four of those together when you look at product margins in fiscal '24. Operator : The next question will come from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : It sounds like you were impacted by both share and weaker demand in all-flash. Is that correct? And is the share loss because of product gap that you are now filling with AFFC? It just seems like a large decline coming just from the low end of the AFF market? So any color there would be helpful. And I have a follow-up. George Kurian : I think that our exposure to the large tech and service provider segments and our large market share in markets like Germany exposed us when those segments and countries slowed down in their purchasing behavior. I think that having a smaller number of QLC products also precluded us from participating in some purchasing activities, some RFPs in the past couple of quarters. And I think we are excited about the return to having the best lineup of flash, both performance and capacity flash. And we've got to see progress in terms of -- continued progress in our enterprise and commercial customers over the next few quarters to wait for the large enterprise purchasing to come back. Wamsi Mohan : And you're exiting this year with somewhat worsening momentum given the macro from down 2% constant currency in Q3 to guiding down 6% in Q4, despite sort of this new introduction of new products. Any early thoughts into fiscal '24? I know you commented on your -- the margin improvement and the confidence there, but anything on the revenue side that you can help us with would be super helpful. Thank you. George Kurian : Yes. I think, first of all, you have seen us be disciplined stewards of the business in good times and bad. You should expect us to continue to maintain operating expenses tightly managed until we see growth. Product margins, as Mike said, should have significant upside as we roll into fiscal year '24 as both mix shifts towards all-flash and component costs in all-flash come down as well as premiums go away. In terms of returning to growth, listen, I think that we will -- we are aligning our resources to be much more focused on our respective businesses. In the flash market, you should expect us to continue to track the progress of our flash market share. I think that, as I said, both enterprise and commercial segments should see growth while the large enterprise takes some more time to come back. And then, I think in terms of cloud, listen, I think consumption will continue to be a headwind for a period of time as our cloud provider partners have also said. That does not mean that we are going to not continue to accelerate new customer acquisition. And a more aligned go-to-market model for flash and for public cloud services, respectively, will help us do that, execute better against each of those opportunities. We'll tell you more when we guide fiscal year '24. Operator : The next question will come from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead. Mehdi Hosseini : It seems like April being the fourth quarter fiscal year helps with a little sequential bump in revenue, but should I expect a rather seasonal trend into Q1 fiscal year '24? And I have a follow-up. George Kurian : Listen, at this point, we are being appropriately conservative in our guidance. I think that we see the impact of a tough macro environment on customer spending. And both Mike and I are being appropriately prudent in our Q4 guide. We're not guiding Q1 at this point. We'll guide fiscal year '24 and Q1 when we do that. But at this point, I want to be prudent about what we see in the market. Mehdi Hosseini : Got it. And then for Mike, should I assume that the full impact of the headcount reduction is dialed into the April quarter, or would you be able to reduce the OpEx into July quarter? Mike Berry : Yes. Thanks, Mehdi, for the question. So, we'll get a portion of the restructuring, call it, 70% to 80% because of notifications and other things. So that is baked into our Q4 implied OpEx of about 675, which is down from our previous number of about 715. Most of that is restructuring and some incentive comp. And then, hey, the other thing -- again, we will guide Q1 when we get there. I just want to add two other things to George's great summary going into next year. We talked about product margins. We talked about OpEx. Keep in mind, too, that FX has been a material headwind for us this year, and we expect -- hope that that is at least flat. The other thing is, keep in mind, from a tax rate perspective, we've grown EPS even with a significantly higher tax rate. So, hey, lots of good things going into fiscal '24 that give us confidence in being able to drive the bottom line. Operator : The next question will come from Tim Long with Barclays. Please go ahead. Tim Long : Two questions, if I could. First, just curious on the flash C product. Could you talk a little bit about -- it sounds like you're expecting that'll cannibalize or replace some of the disk and hybrid-based systems. Any risk there that there is some impact on the higher performance flash? And what would that mean to margin structure or revenues? And then, I have a follow-up on the cloud after that. George Kurian : I think the capacity flash arrays that we recently announced have a workload profile and a performance profile that's distinct from the performance flash array. Performance flash are typically sub-millisecond kind of latency. In capacity flash, it's about 2 to 3 milliseconds. So, they are distinct use cases. Capacity flash will be an upsell on the hybrid flash array and will over time impact the percentage of our business mix that's hybrid flash. Tim Long : Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then on the cloud part and the recovery, two-parter. One, have you noticed any level of engagement? I mean, we've got the pushouts that's going around. But any different level of engagement by the big cloud players? And then, related to that, how have you guys progressed with transitioning ONTAP on-premise customers to also start taking some of your cloud-based services in their hybrid cloud deployments? Thank you. George Kurian : We continue to have great engagement with our cloud provider partners. As I mentioned, customer acquisition continues to be a good part of our cloud business. The impact in the quarter is limited because the initial deployments are small. So that's the first. Second, with regard to cross-selling multiple cloud services after the initial use case, we have done well, and I'm pleased with progress. In terms of the customers that we are engaged with on consumption, there is no churn difference, right? So, the pattern is they are reducing the performance level of the storage use case, but they're not churning off our service. So, I feel really good. Actually, I think it's the best part of being a partner is to help your clients use the right combination of services. And then, in terms of penetration of our installed base, while it's early, we continue to see that moving forward steadily. I think the penetration in our NetApp managed enterprise accounts is much higher than in our commercial segment. Operator : The next question will come from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : I guess I had two on the Public Cloud. And if I can just start with just the broader trends that you're seeing in relation to Public Cloud and the pressures around consumption and optimization. It does indicate that not every use case that the enterprises were leveraging were critical in the cloud. I mean how do you think about some of the addressable market that you were defining around the cloud storage and CloudOps? Just in relation to that, I guess, enterprises don't see everything as being critical in the cloud, and there's a lot more room for optimization as is being demonstrated during these budget cuts. And I have a follow-up. George Kurian : First of all, I think that the long-term trend towards cloud continues to be a strong trend. I think even if you look at the most recent data from analysts as well as from the cloud providers, the public cloud market growth is higher than data center infrastructure growth. So, that's one. I think second is we are learning the behavior patterns of different workload profiles in our customer base. I actually think the fact that customers can spin up and spin down environment is a benefit to the cloud model over the long term because the real cost of operating a cloud environment will then be lower than what you would see on premises. We are, for example, being able to understand -- and as we spread the consumption of our cloud services across a much larger customer base, the impact of any particular customers change in behavior will actually be much less than it is today. So, we remain bullish about the cloud opportunity. We're more sharply focusing our go-to-market resources to go after it and continuing to sharpen the customer success motion to allow our customers to benefit from the use of our technology more completely. Samik Chatterjee : Okay. And maybe on the same line, just digging a little bit deeper. Like, what are you seeing in relation to sort of the difference in engagement on Spot versus Cloud Insights? And when you have net revenue retention rates of around 120%, like how does that break down between Spot and the rest of the portfolio maybe seeing a bit more challenges? George Kurian : Spot has done well, and Cloud Insights has stabilized and met our internal targets. So, the shortfall was mostly from the cloud storage business. I think that in part, it's the opposite, right? When people are concerned about cost optimization, Spot is a perfect tool for that, and they had a good quarter. Operator : The next question will come from Krish Sankar with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Krish Sankar : The first one is it seems like despite the cloud optimization service being 40% of your portfolio, your cloud portfolio -- the magnitude of decline from Public Cloud service seems to be more than offsetting. Any improvement there? Second is, tell us how was the performance of this? And do you think at some point this year -- calendar year, it could get -- to be more than 50% of your cloud ARR? And then I have a follow-up. George Kurian : We continue to add new customers to our -- all of our cloud services, CloudOps and cloud storage. The impact of those customers in the first few quarters of they are being acquired is actually small because they typically find small deals, and they are testing out the services or they deploy a development and test environment rather than a production environment. Those customers were actually -- the benefits to our business from those customers was overrun by the reduction from some of the large customers who contracted their spending in the quarter. So, we feel good about new customer additions. Can we do more there? Surely, but I don't think that was a material issue in the quarter. Mike Berry : And if I could. It's Mike. We talked about, Krish, hey, cloud storage is about 60%. CloudOps is about 40%. We don't see that changing materially. It'll move around a little bit by quarter, but we expect that to remain relatively consistent over the next several quarters. Mehdi Hosseini : Got it. Got it. Super helpful, George and Mike. And then as a quick follow-up, George, kind of like what is your visibility today? Like, how many months\u2019 visibility do you have? And also to an earlier question, George, you mentioned that when a customer's business gets better, they'll start spending again. I mean, I just wanted to find, is it as simple as that, or do you have to look at other metrics like kind of how you said, deal sizes are smaller, maybe deal size gets larger, you don't need a CFO approval for purchases? Are there any other leading indicators to look into? Thank you. George Kurian : We do a whole lot of account level analysis, especially for our larger customers. We look at total wallet. We look at whether we are gaining share or losing share. We look at are we -- do we need to bring new business models to the customer. We have done well with our consumption business. Our Keystone offering, there are many customers that have chosen to use that over the past couple of quarters rather than go the CapEx route. So, we're heavily involved with customers, right? I'll just tell you that it's a daily conversation with customers. I'm just starting to sort of take the broader theme that, in general, what we see with the larger customers is that when their business outlook improves, they generally start to purchase. Some segments that typically go ahead of GDP and economic performance lead the market, and other parts of that large enterprise segment come along when GDP turns around. So look at the business cycle of those customers, that's probably the best leading indicator. Operator : The next question will come from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Please go ahead. Matt Sheerin : I had a question on the pricing environment. Are you seeing any incremental pricing pressure from competitors given the slower demand environment? And with the expectation of lower input costs, both on components and NAND give you an opportunity to be more aggressive on pricing, or is that not part of the playbook? George Kurian : I think it's always a competitive environment, and it continues to be a competitive environment in a tough demand environment. I don't see any player doing anything kind of out of the ordinary. I think that just like everyone else, we see the opportunity, especially with QLC-based flash arrays, to be competitive in the market. Operator : The next question will come from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Sidney Ho : You guys have seen a few down cycles in the past 10 years where you saw multiple quarters of overall revenue decline of 10% or more on a year-over-year basis. I think that was in 2016, 2020. Curious how you think this cycle will shake out. Maybe just help us compare and contrast with the previous cycles in terms of the depth and duration of the downturn. Maybe they're completely different. And then I have follow-up question. George Kurian : Listen, I think that we've got a different mix of business today than we did in the past. I think there's a growing percentage of our business from more recurring revenue business models like the cloud business. I think we have tried to move more of our resources to parts of the market that are less cyclical and that allow us to acquire new customers to broaden our customer base. I would say we've done a good job, not enough, but we've certainly seen good progress. And we will continue to pivot in that direction. I think the large customer segment behavior pattern is quite similar to what we've seen in the past. I think that 2016 is quite similar to what we see today. The only thing that I would point out is that the -- for many customers, 2020 was a very difficult year. And so, there's -- it hasn't been -- this downturn has not been presaged by many, many years of economic expansion. So, we're hopeful that customers will be back buying in a more predictable pattern than they have in the past. Sidney Ho : Okay. That's great. Maybe a quick follow-up here. Just on the earlier answer on the operating expenses. You talked about holding OpEx flat until you see growth. But to be clear, are you expecting OpEx to be down in the July quarter from the 675 level in the April quarter, which I know it's seasonally down for OpEx anyway for the July quarter? And you hold expenses at those levels going forward until revenue growth resumes? Is that how we should think about it? Mike Berry : Yes. Sidney, it's Mike. So, there's a couple of nuances, I'll try to keep this brief, is that in the Q4 number, we do have a portion of the restructuring benefit. We'll get all of that in Q1. The thing that will come back in Q1 is incentive compensation, hopefully will come back. You've seen this, Sidney, in the last -- you talked about some of the downturns. You've seen this coming out of it as well. So, on an absolute dollar perspective, it's probably up slightly Q4 to Q1 just based on that. But everything else from a controllable perspective, we will try to keep that as flat as we can outside of movements in incentive comp. Operator : The next question will come from Jim Suva with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Jim Suva : I have different questions, one for George and one for Mike. I'll ask them at the same time, and you all can answer them in any order. But George, in the past several years, you have gained significant market share, very significant. With the slowdown, I'm wondering if you're seeing any share shifts. Are you continuing to gain share, or are you seeing any competitive pricing get even more aggressive? I know it's a competitive market, but your past several years have spoken multiple leagues of share gains. And so, I'm just kind of wondering from that perspective. And then for Mike, can you comment on the FX? Are we looking at kind of maybe two more quarters and then a lapse or 3 or 4 more quarters because the FedEx -- I'm sorry, the FX headwinds are very severe, and you're still keeping your full year guidance, which is remarkable, but the FX, you simply can't, just discredit it because it was so material. So, any looks of when we start to lap that? Thank you. George Kurian : I think on the share part, our exposure to the large enterprise is bigger than some of our competitors. And so, I think in a down cycle, we will probably concede share given our exposure to those customers. I think the second is now that we have a more kind of full lineup of capacity flash arrays, I feel good that we can compete in all the segments of the flash market, which are key to driving share gains, and keep the hybrid flash segment where we have a strong offering moving forward. And then, I think, as I noted in my comments, we are going to better align our execution in the field so that we can more sharply focus on the storage market and more sharply focus on the cloud market in a more tailored go-to-market model for each. Mike Berry : And Jim, it's Mike. On your FX question, for a full year now, this is on revenue, we expect it to be about a 350 basis-point headwind for the full year, about 140 basis points in Q4 compared to 340 in Q3. I would expect that it would be almost zero, but slightly a headwind in Q1 and then lap in Q2. Operator : The next question will come from Jason Ader with William Blair. Please go ahead. Jason Ader : Hey George, are there any headwinds that you guys are seeing on the revenue side from NAND pricing coming down sharply on your AFA business? In other words, just street pricing because we know some of your competitors have kind of a cost-plus -- cost model -- margin model. George Kurian : I think that overall customers' budget in dollars, and so we segmented the market and the use cases quite distinctly for performance versus capacity flash. I don't think there's going to be material cannibalization between the two. I think it really comes down to customer budget dollars being available. Jason Ader : Got you. So is it -- is this different than what we saw back in, like, 2018, 2019 where NAND prices came down really drastically and it affected kind of revenue for the whole industry? George Kurian : I think that we've always seen customers buy in dollars, and they budget in dollars. So, I think if you ask me right now, I don't actually see the NAND pricing coming down being the real headwind. I really do think it\u2019s customers' budget and IT spending that's the more material area of focus for us. Operator : The next question will come from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Meta Marshall : On the CloudOps portfolio, you guys have spoken to kind of a more aligned or sharpened go-to-market motion. I just wanted to get a sense of some of the integrations of that product portfolio that was going to happen and just whether that's a part of that kind of refined go-to-market and where we are on that. And then the second kind of piece of that question is just on the cloud storage piece. You guys have had a little bit less of visibility into kind of that customer set, just getting a sense of, are some of these sharpening go-to-market motions kind of overlay sales? Just anything that's happening on the cloud storage to increase visibility there. Thanks. George Kurian : Yes. I think first, Meta, on the CloudOps piece, we brought together the sales teams for Instaclustr, CloudCheckr and Spot into one unified CloudOps selling motion. And we've seen good momentum with the integrated team. I think, particularly Spot and Instaclustr, there's good synergy in terms of customer buyer and buying motions that we hope to exploit over the next few quarters. It's too early to call it a success yet. In terms of the product portfolio, we brought some of the functionality of CloudCheckr into Spot already for compliance, and you should see us bringing more of those capabilities into Spot. With regard to cloud storage, listen, I think the most important work that we're doing is to be closely aligned with the hyperscalers, hyperscaler cloud providers and some of the key application motions that are going on, SAP or chip design or VMware. And I think that what we are going to do as we head into FY24 is even more closely align our hyperscaling -- hyperscale sales resources with those buying motions. I think that that will give us a better understanding of customer behavior. We've seen good adoption of our customer success capabilities in our subscription cloud storage business, but we are yet to see the full impact from doing so in the consumption cloud business. And that's work ahead of us. Operator : Next question will come from Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Shannon Cross : I'm wondering, how should we think about the impact of your 8% headcount reduction on your top line? I know you mentioned a couple of areas you've invested, but can you provide some more details on where the cuts were made? And how much of it was, I don't know, the proverbial back office versus revenue-focused headcount? And then, I have a follow-up. Thank you. George Kurian : I think that those cuts were -- are factored into our guidance for this quarter. And when we guide next year, you should expect us to factor those into the guidance. Broadly speaking, we focused our resources on the biggest market opportunities, and the places that we impacted were less significant contributors to revenue for us. I think in the cloud portfolio as well as in CloudOps, we've made some decisions that will have impact to ARR going forward. But I think that those are in the spirit of let's focus on the best markets and the best opportunities. Our guidance for the quarter envisages those changes. Mike, do you want to add anything? Mike Berry : No, no. I think that's a great answer. It's all baked in. And we did it across the board. We tried to focus where we didn't have productivity or revenue issues, as George said, a little bit of ARR. Outside of that, we feel good that we focused on the right areas. Shannon Cross : I guess, were there any cuts in Hybrid Cloud? And then my second question is, what drove the year-over-year increase in stock-based comp given all of the pressures you're seeing? Thank you. George Kurian : In Hybrid Cloud, as I noted in my comments, we impacted Astra Data Store. We are able to solve the Kubernetes use case better through a combination of Astra Control, which we continue to invest in, and ONTAP rather than a completely separate architecture like Astra Data Store. And then, we had a small business in SolidFire that we continue to sustain, but we don't plan to grow going forward. Mike Berry : Shannon, on your question on stock-based comp, every six months, we have to do a look back on ESPP program. And there was about an $11 million, I'll call it, catch-up entry in the quarter to take into account the lower price of those purchases. And you'll see that typically every six months when we do our ESPP, depending on the price movements of the stock during that period of time. Shannon Cross : So that catch-up is done now. And assuming your stock stays where it's at, there will be another catch-up? So you'll be at the $50 million or $60 million level going forward? Just to be clear. Mike Berry : So, it stays in the run rate. It won't drop down. And what happens in six months is dependent on where the stock price is at that purchase date. Operator : The next question will come from Nehal Chokshi with Northland. Please go ahead. Nehal Chokshi : What has been the year-over-year demand trend in the month of February relative to the January quarter? Has it worsened as implied by the guidance even with the C-Series now available? George Kurian : We're not going to comment about what's happening this quarter. I think broadly speaking, we're cautious, as you can see in our guidance, about the pattern of IT spending for the year. I think many parts of our business performed well, but the large enterprise, particularly in the Americas, high tech and service provider segments, and certain parts of Europe, particularly UK and Germany, have not performed as well. And we're concerned about how spend -- how robust spending will be there in the short term. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. And what's the postmortem on why you guys were late with the lower capacity product on all-flash arrays? George Kurian : We have hybrid flash arrays that serve those use cases. We believe that we could continue to support those use cases with hybrid flash. A few months ago, we -- a few quarters ago, we created a capacity flash product. We started to see strong pickup, but it was at the high end of our lineup, and we realized that we needed to introduce a full lineup. And that has taken us a little bit more time than we expected. So, I feel good about our lineup now. It is the most comprehensive in terms of functionality, use cases, guarantees and price and capacity points in the market. Operator : The next question will come from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead. Ananda Baruah : Hey George, just sort of circling back to your remarks about concentration with financial services and service provider. Do you feel the company has greater exposure to those end markets than your key competitors? And is there anything that you can do or that you're focused on to try to diversify that exposure? And then, I have a quick follow-up. Thanks. George Kurian : Listen, I don't want to comment about our competitors. I should let you ask them that question. I think what we have seen is that we are -- have got a large base of high-tech and service provider customers and large enterprise customers. They are demanding customers, and they are forward-leaning. And there's lots of benefits to having those customers. But when they are in a down cycle, it does impact our business. Over the years, we've done a few things to expand our business. I think, one, we continue to invest in the commercial segment. It's too early to call that a broad push, but we've seen good results. We've also brought in the number of enterprise customers. We sign up below the large enterprise. And perhaps most importantly, has been the push to grow our cloud business. Cloud has been the single most strongest vehicle for new customer issues for us, and I'm very pleased with that route-to-market that we've enabled over the past few years. Ananda Baruah : That's great context. And the quick follow-up is, both you and Mike, in your prepared remarks -- or Mike, I think, in his prepared remarks and yours in response to a question made reference to mix shift in all-flash in '24 -- sorry, not mix -- industry shift all-flash in '24. So, I was just wondering is that something that you guys see as being distinct from what current trend is. Do you see a break in the trend? And that's it. So, an amplification trend. Thanks. George Kurian : I think broadly speaking, as we have said in past cycles, when the price of NAND comes down, you see a mix shift towards a flash-based system. Disk-based systems costs have been more steady than sort of up and down like flash. So, that's the broad trend. In our case, we expect that shift to also benefit from the fact that we now have two complete lineups, high-performance flash, which will benefit from NAND and capacity flash, which will also benefit from NAND. Operator : Our last question will come from Kyle McNealy with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Kyle McNealy : Can you talk a little bit about the positive impact you expect to have from AI on the business? What's the positive impact? Where it will come from? Is it a higher mix of high-performance, low-latency all-flash? Is it sheer data growth or both those factors? And do you think we'll have to get past the near-term softer macro environment that you've been talking about through '23 until we see some kind of material new AI workload growth? Thanks. George Kurian : AI workloads continue to grow in parts of the market that are more resilient to commodity cycles. So for example, life sciences, certain elements of financial services, industries that are more countercyclical have done well, and we continue to see that moving forward. AI workloads, especially those that do image and audio analysis, for example, in life sciences, cancer detection or various types of diagnostic cases are perfectly suited to NetApp. I mean, we store a large number of files in a very high-performance system. And so, we are benefiting from those use cases today. And certainly, as the range of AI tool chain continues to grow, we expect that to be a more material contributor to our business going forward. Kris Newton : Thanks, Kyle. I'm going to pass it back to George for some closing comments. George Kurian : Thanks, Kris. Our strategy is aligned to the long-term secular growth trends of data-driven digital and cloud transformations. We address key long-term priorities for our customers with strong positions in each of our key markets and have demonstrated success in controlling the elements within our control. Over the course of our history, we have been through several challenging macroeconomic periods that we have used to sharpen our focus, attack new opportunities and emerge in a better position. We are committed to doing that again. You can expect us to remain prudent stewards of the business, tightly managing the elements within our control, reinvigorate efforts across the company in support of our storage business and build a more focused approach to our Public Cloud business. We'll give you updates on our progress in coming quarters. Thank you. Operator : This conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Newton, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kris Newton : Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian, and CFO, Mike Berry. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com. During today's call, we will make a number of forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, including, without limitation, our guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year 2024; our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability and shareholder returns; and other growth initiatives and strategies. These statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may cause our actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC and on our website, including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP, unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are available on our website. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to George. George Kurian : Thanks Kris. Welcome, everyone, to our fourth quarter FY 23 call. Our Q4 results reflect solid execution in the face of ongoing macroeconomic challenges. We delivered revenue above the midpoint of our guidance, with disciplined operational management yielding all-time high quarterly operating margin and EPS above expectations. For FY 23, we delivered record high annual operating margin and EPS, despite the slow demand environment and relatively flat revenue from FY 22. Even as customers are tightening their budgets in response to the macro, they are not stopping investments in applications and technologies that drive business productivity and growth. Digital transformation projects involving business analytics, AI, data security, and application modernization, both on premises and in the cloud remain top priorities for IT organizations. This drives our confidence in the health of our markets and future growth opportunity, despite the temporary macro headwinds. We are participating in the areas of priority spending with a modern approach to hybrid, multi-cloud infrastructure and data management. By providing customers with the ability to leverage data across their entire estate with simplicity, security, and sustainability, we increase our relevance and value. And we continue to introduce new innovations to deliver greater customer value, further strengthening our position. On our last call, I outlined our three areas of focus to sharpen our execution to better deliver results, while at the same time, positioning ourselves for long-term success. As a reminder, the focus areas are : remain prudent stewards of the business, tightly managing the elements within our control, reinvigorate efforts across the company in support of our storage systems business, and build a more focused approach to our Public Cloud business. As you can see from our Q4 and FY 2023 results, we have demonstrated success in managing the elements within our control and staying flexible to adapt to the ever changing environment. We remain committed to maintaining operational discipline as we move through FY 2024, adjusting as appropriate, to drive operating margin expansion and EPS growth while also continuing to invest for the long-term. Turning to our storage systems business. Q4 Hybrid Cloud segment revenue of $1.4 billion was down 8% year-over-year and up 4% sequentially. Our all-flash array business decreased 4% from Q4 a year ago to an annualized revenue run rate of $3.1 billion. Similar to Q3, headwinds from large enterprises weighed on our product and AFA revenue. As you\u2019ve seen, we are reinvigorating our storage portfolio, innovating to deliver greater customer value, reach new customers, and better address areas of priority spending and market growth. ONTAP AI and FlexPod AI are proven and tested reference architectures to help speed and simplify AI deployments. These solutions are designed around our all-flash arrays which are uniquely suited to meet the performance, multiprotocol, and data mobility demands of AI workloads. In Q4, we demonstrated industry leading performance in the GPU Direct benchmark, proof of our ability to enable customers to use the full power of GPU technology for AI. Our affinity to AI use cases doesn\u2019t stop at performance; ONTAP includes native data management tools that streamline workflows for data science teams and integrate multi-platform, multi-site, and multi-cloud data pipelines. With new performance and data management features planned in upcoming ONTAP releases, we expect to raise the bar again not just for performance but for total workflow solutions that help companies realize the benefits of AI faster and with better results. The new AFF C-series, our comprehensive portfolio of QLC-based all-flash arrays, began shipping late in Q4. We are very pleased with the initial customer response. In addition to lots of quoting activity, we closed a good number of deals in the fourth quarter. One of our early C-series wins was a $15 million deal at a large financial institution for business-critical workloads in its cloud-ready, service-level defined environment. We beat the competition with a solution that was significantly denser and more energy efficient. Following this highly successful launch, we introduced the NetApp ASA A-series early in Q1. The ASA is a new line of SAN-specific flash storage systems that deliver high levels of performance, scalability, data availability, efficiency, and cloud connectivity with up to 50% lower power consumption and associated carbon emissions than competitive offerings. The ASA complements our unified storage offerings to address block-only use cases, while avoiding the operational and data siloes of competitors' products. We are also innovating to improve the customer experience. In Q4, we introduced NetApp Advance, a portfolio of programs bringing predictability and adaptability, including the Storage Lifecycle Program for non-disruptive storage upgrades. At the start of Q1, we announced ONTAP One, a simple way to buy and consume all the native software capabilities of ONTAP. We\u2019re enhancing the value of these built-in capabilities with our Ransomware Recovery Guarantee, which leverages ONTAP\u2019s unique combination of key built-in security and ransomware protection features to detect, stop, and recover from ransomware attacks in real-time. In addition to delivering significant innovation, we have also rebalanced our go-to-market efforts, including focusing our broad sales organization on selling flash through compensation plans and reinstituting a specialist sales team for cloud. We believe these actions will allow the team to better address the large storage TAM. Entering FY 2024, I am confident that these actions will enable us to drive product revenue growth and regain share in the all-flash array market. We are seeing early, positive signs, but the full benefit of these changes will take time to develop and should be a driver for product revenue growth in the second half. While we are sharpening our attack on the storage market, we are not taking our eye off the Public Cloud opportunity. Public Cloud ARR of $620 million was up 23% year-over-year and ahead of our expectations, driven by strength in Public Cloud storage services. Our Public Cloud business in Q4 was backend loaded, resulting in softer revenue and lower DBNRR than our ARR results would indicate. Public Cloud revenue for Q4 was $151 million and DBNRR was 114%. Our Public Cloud Services are highly differentiated, with a multiyear advantage over our traditional competitors and they create customer preference for NetApp. The number of total cloud customers, customers using multiple of our Public Cloud services, and customers with greater than $500,000 of revenue in the quarter, all continue to grow nicely. While, like our cloud partners, we see continued cloud optimizations, some of the customers whose optimizations created significant headwinds for us in FY 2023 have kicked off new projects that we expect to scale over the next 18 months. We believe that our first-party storage services, branded and sold by our cloud partners, represent our biggest opportunity. We have aligned our sales specialist resources to our cloud partners\u2019 customer segmentation and go-to-market structure to tighten our alignment to and improve our execution against this opportunity. Over the course of FY 2024, we will scale our customer success team to further improve customer retention and expansion and develop a more focused cloud channel model. Cloud operations remains an important market for us, and we have dedicated go-to-market resources to address this opportunity. We have not wavered in our conviction that Public Cloud services has the potential to be a multibillion-dollar ARR business for us. While the shift to cloud is experiencing an industry-wide slowdown, the long-term trend in favor of cloud is unchanged. In conclusion, while FY 2023 was not the year we expected at its outset, our disciplined management enabled us to overcome a number of headwinds to deliver all-time high operating margin and EPS. The fundamentals of our business model are sound and our confidence in our strategy and the health of long-term opportunity is unchanged. We are entering fiscal year 2024 with substantially more innovation and a new, more focused operating model to attack the areas of priority spending. In this uncertain environment, we will remain agile and continue to be disciplined stewards of the business. We believe our actions will drive margin expansion and earnings growth while yielding top line growth in the back half of the year. Thank you to the NetApp team for their dedication and focus. I am pleased with our progress, but we recognize our work is not done. We look forward to building on this momentum and driving long-term value for our shareholders. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mike. Mike Berry : Thank you, George and good afternoon everyone. As George noted, we are laser focused on managing the elements within our control. Our focus enabled us to deliver strong P&L performance for the full year and Q4. Before getting into the details, let me quickly highlight the key themes of our results and expectations for fiscal year 2024. As a reminder, all numbers discussed are non-GAAP unless otherwise noted. We delivered record setting operating margin and EPS above our guidance range in both Q4 and fiscal year 2023. We will continue to prudently manage the business to position ourselves for long-term success while driving further operating margin expansion and EPS growth in fiscal year 2024. We are confident in the strength of our position and alignment to areas of priority spend. However, macro uncertainties and FX headwinds have pressured IT budgets and lowered spending. We believe these headwinds are temporary and that the spending environment will rebound in time. We reached our product gross margin target of mid-50s ahead of expectations. In fiscal year 2024, we expect to maintain product gross margin at this level and drive improvement to Public Cloud gross margin. In fiscal year 2023, we returned 148% of free cash flow to shareholders and reduced full year share count by 4% from the prior year. We plan to continue a strong policy of shareholder returns in fiscal year 2024. Now to the details. Fiscal year 2023 billings of $6.41 billion were down 4% from fiscal year 2022. Revenue of $6.36 billion was up 1% year-over-year. Adjusting for the headwind from FX, billings would have been down 1%, and revenue would have been up 4% year-over-year. Disciplined operational management yielded all-time fiscal year highs for operating margin and EPS. Operating margin was 24.2%, including a 150-basis point headwind from FX. EPS was $5.59 and included $0.57 of year over year FX headwind. Q4 billings of $1.67 billion were down 17% year-over-year, including roughly two points of FX headwind. Revenue came in above the midpoint of our guidance range at $1.58 billion, down 6% from last year or 4%, adjusting for FX. The uncertain macro negatively impacted revenue in both our Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud segments, as customers continue to exhibit caution in capital expenditures and look to optimize cloud spend. Hybrid Cloud revenue of $1.43 billion was down 8% year-over-year. Product revenue was $744 million and down 17% from Q4 last year. Support revenue of $598 million increased 1% year-over-year. Public Cloud ARR exited the year ahead of expectations at $620 million, up 23% year-over-year. Public Cloud revenue composed 10% of total revenue in Q4 and grew 26% year-over-year to $151 million. We exited fiscal year 2023 with $4.31 billion in deferred revenue, an increase of 2% year-over-year. Growth of deferred revenue is the best leading indicator for recurring revenue growth; Q4 marks the 21st consecutive quarter of year-over-year deferred revenue growth. Q4 consolidated gross margin was 69%, above our guidance. Total Hybrid Cloud gross margin was also 69%. Product gross margin was 55%, well ahead of guidance, driven by lower premiums, better mix, and lower FX headwinds. As we\u2019ve described on previous calls, we expect to retain all the benefit from the reduction in premiums and will be responsive to market pricing of commodity components. Our recurring support business continues to be highly profitable, with gross margin of 92%. Public Cloud gross margin was 66%. Q4 again highlighted the strength of our business model and our operational discipline with operating margin of 26%, an all-time quarterly high. EPS of $1.54 was comfortably above the high end of guidance and included $0.08 of year-over-year FX headwind. In Q4, cash flow from operations was $235 million and free cash flow was $196 million. Free cash flow for fiscal year 2023 of $868 million came in below expectations due to lower collections and timing of payments. As we noted on our last call, Q4 cash flow included certain one-time restructuring and tax payments, together totaling approximately $85 million. Inventory turns of 12 were steady from last quarter and last year. During Q4, we repurchased $150 million in stock and paid out $106 million in cash dividends. For the year, we repurchased a total of $850 million in stock and paid out $432 million in cash dividends, representing 148% of free cash flow. Q4 diluted share count of 217 million was down 5% year-over-year. We have approximately $400 million left on our current share repurchase authorization as of the end of fiscal year 2023 and today are announcing an additional authorization of $1 billion. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We closed the year with $3.07 billion in cash and short-term investments. Now, to guidance. Let me underscore our confidence in our strategy and the strength of our position in addressing key customer priorities, like business analytics, AI, data security, and application modernization. However, we expect the macro to remain challenged, with continued pressure on IT budgets and the demand environment. As a result, we expect fiscal year 2024 total revenue to be down in the low to mid-single-digits measured on a percentage basis. Public Cloud will continue to be a positive contributor with revenue growth expected in the mid-teens. Implied in our fiscal year 2024 revenue guidance is year-over-year growth in the second half driven by sales of recently introduced flash products and benefits from our go-to-market changes. While we are hopeful that the macroeconomy will improve in the second half of our fiscal year, our plans for fiscal year 2024 incorporate the environment we are seeing today and do not assume a material change to the economic or demand backdrop. We expect fiscal year 2024 consolidated gross margin to be roughly 70%. We believe that product margins will remain approximately 55%, supported by lower premiums and a rotation to higher margin, all-flash products. To take advantage of record low NAND prices, we have made strategic purchase commitments to lock in pricing for a large portion of our expected fiscal year 2024 SSD demand. This will help us maintain product gross margin levels when component prices rise in the future. We expect to see Public Cloud gross margin improvement in fiscal year 2024, driven by revenue scale and lower depreciation expense. We remain confident in our long-term Public Cloud gross margin target of 75% to 80%. We anticipate operating margins of approximately 25% and EPS of $5.65 to $5.85. Implied in this guidance is the expectation that we will hold operating expenses roughly flat versus fiscal year 2023. Fiscal year 2024 op ex includes benefits from the Q4 reduction in force, offset by annual merit increases, a reset of variable compensation, and incremental expenses to support our first in-person sales kick off and INSIGHT user conference since 2019. Operating expenses should be spread fairly evenly throughout the year. We expect a tax rate in the range of 21% to 22%. Operating cash flow will move in line with net income, although there will be some quarterly variance based on working capital. As we\u2019ve stated before, fiscal year 2023 should be the peak for CapEx with expenditures beginning to come down in fiscal year 2024. Our healthy cash flow generation enables us to continue our strong program of capital returns to shareholders. In fiscal year 2024, we intend to return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders in share buybacks and dividends. We plan to hold our quarterly dividend steady at $0.50 per share throughout fiscal year 2024, with the remainder of free cash going to share buybacks. We expect the timing of buybacks to be roughly similar to fiscal year 2023, and to reduce share count by at least 2% in fiscal year 2024. Now, on to Q1 guidance. We expect Q1 revenue to range between $1.325 billion and $1.475 billion, which at the midpoint implies a decline of 12% year-over-year. Remember that first half fiscal year 2023 revenue, most notably product revenue, benefited from elevated levels of backlog from supply chain constraints, impacting the year-over-year comparisons. We expect Q1 consolidated gross margin to be roughly 70% and operating margin to be approximately 20%. EPS should be in the range of $1 to $1.10. Q1 cash flow will be impacted by payments associated with SSD purchase commitments, partially offset by lower incentive compensation payments year-over-year related to our fiscal year 2023 performance. In closing, I want to echo George\u2019s appreciation of the NetApp team and their continued commitment in this uncertain environment. As I look forward into fiscal year 2024, I am confident in our strategy and our ability to continue to improve our execution and increase profitability. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Kris for Q&A. Kris Newton : Thanks Mike. Operator, let\u2019s begin the Q&A. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And our first question will come from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, guys. Thank you. This is Mike on behalf of Aaron. I just wanted to ask, you mentioned some customers have kicked off new projects following a period of digestion or optimization. I'm just curious, can you give us a sense of how many customers you put in this bucket versus ones that continue to be cautious or maybe are becoming incrementally more cautious, just trying to get a sense of how the demand environment has changed? Thanks. George Kurian : Broadly speaking, the Q4 demand environment was not substantially different from what we saw in Q3, and our plans for next year contemplate continuation of the same environment. We talked about in the cloud segment, some of the larger customers who had significantly optimized their landscape through the course of the prior quarters began to take on the projects that we anticipated them taking on. These projects take some time to ramp. We also saw strength in new customer additions and the number of customers that were using multiple products from NetApp, so all good signs for future revenue growth. That being said, customers on a broad basis, still cautious about spending and particularly in the large enterprise segment. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Samik Chatterjee of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Thanks for taking my question. I guess for the first one. If I sort of -- you reiterated a few times you're really not baking in any macro improvement to the guide, but you did highlight the opportunity to get back to revenue growth in the second half. Just wondering if you can help us think through both of those pieces, particularly when I sort of put them against each other, it does look like you're calling for more of a share gain than revenue rebound in the second half of the year, what sort of drives confidence in this sort of a sequential ramp in revenue through the year? And is there more to it than sort of share gain? And I have a quick follow-up. Thank you. George Kurian : I think broadly speaking, we are super excited about the recent portfolio introductions we've made. We've seen the benefits of improved focus in our field organization. It takes a few quarters to build. And I think if you look at the pattern of sequential linearity through next fiscal year, it is similar to what we have seen in more traditional years. I think FY 2023 was a bit anomalous. And so we feel good about the progress through the year. I think with regard to the macro, we are not -- we've built our plan assuming the macro stays the same. Clearly, if there's upside to the macro, that should be a benefit to us over the course of the year. Mike Berry : Hey, Samik, it's Mike. If I could just add on to that and want to underline the one point George made. When we talk about our guide for 2024, when we talk about linearity, that's -- and we define that as total revenue we expect in the first half versus the second half. That's much more at where we've been historically, which is about 48% and 52% in those halves. So, when you take a look at the year-over-year growth rates in 2024, just keep in mind that those were heavily influenced by the backlog last year. So when you normalize for that, it looks like a much more normal linearity in 2024. Samik Chatterjee : Okay, got it. On the cloud business, the growth expectations that you have for fiscal 2024. Can you just outline how you're thinking about sort of retention business versus new business wins? And also curious if you obviously highlighted the AI opportunity, but do you see that opportunity on the cloud revenue side as well? Thank you. George Kurian : Listen, I think, first of all, we are very pleased with new customer acquisition, the broadening of our workloads, clearly the performance, and the efficiency and multiprotocol capability of our storage is an advantage whether for AI workloads, whether they are on-premises or in Public Cloud. What we've seen in Public Cloud for AI is a lot of data science teams using the prebuilt tools that are available on the Public Cloud to calibrate and get their learning models of the curve quickly. And that's uniquely available with NetApp. I think with regard to our perspective for the full year, listen, cloud storage, especially the storage that's sold alongside the hyperscalers will be the primary driver of our business next year. I think if you look at the total dollars in any given year, the opportunity to expand existing customers is substantially larger than the amount that new customers contribute because they are just small, but we feel good about the pace of new customer acquisition. And now our installed base of cloud customers is very substantial. So, there's a good opportunity to cross-sell and upsell them more capabilities. Samik Chatterjee : Got it. Great. Thank you. Thanks for the color. Operator : The next question comes from Meta Marshall of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. Maybe first question, you noted starting to kind of -- noted seeing customers coming out of optimization periods and starting to add workloads. Just wanted to gain a sense of, are you seeing that more with larger or smaller customers or any particular types of workloads that they're starting to kind of add back? And then maybe second question, the Series-C customer that you noted winning in the quarter. Just any commentary on whether that was an existing customer? And just you noted efficiency and kind of energy efficiency being the reason for the sale, but just kind of how long that sales cycle was just any details there would be helpful. Thanks. George Kurian : Yes. So, let me get the two questions. The first one is what we've seen in the cloud environment is that customers are still progressing new workload deployment, meaning new applications, analytics environment, AIML environment and so on, right, and that has not slowed down. I think there was a period of time where customers were monitoring their environments and optimizing the infrastructure, but the new deployments continue. I think where we have seen people being more cautious is about migration of on-premises environments, for example, to Public Cloud, where they are benchmarking the total cost of each of those landscapes. We have a large and growing opportunity in public cloud on new workloads because of the capabilities and the certifications that we continue to bring. And so we're excited about that opportunity. I think with regard to the customer we mentioned, they were not using NetApp for the landscape that we won. We won -- we replaced a competitive environment, and we did so based on the new C-Series products that had a significant advantage over all the competitive products, both in terms of our traditional advantages around multiprotocol and all of the data management features, but we're also substantially more efficient from a power consumption and density standpoint. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : The next question comes from Steven Fox of Fox Advisors. Please go ahead. Steven Fox : Hi, good afternoon. Just one question for me. I don't think I'm alone in this, but the product gross margin surprised substantially the upside of seven, eight points of upside by my account. Can you just break down how that happened? And whether any of that is transitional? How much carries through the rest of the year in your full fiscal year plan? Thanks. Mike Berry : Sure. Hey, Steven, it's Mike. So, let's do the walk from Q3 to Q4, what we guided and where we ended up. So, Q3 product margins were about 46%. We guided approximately 50% largely with the full expectation that we would continue to get relief from premiums that we've talked a lot about. And my goal is to never mention the work premium is on another call going forward. That was about 500 basis point benefit to the quarter, and we expected that to be. The two things that were incremental is mix came in better than we expected. And by that, we mean the capacity per system came in a little bit better. If you remember, in Q3, we talked about that, that caused a little bit of a reduction in gross margins as well as a little bit better all-flash margin. And then FX helped a little bit quarter-on-quarter as well. So, that's the walk from 46% to 55%. As we look into next year, we're assuming that we can retain that 55%. There's a little bit of premium benefit left, but we're also going to make sure that we are flexible as the component pricing rolls through that we can be competitive in the market. And then in addition, we also talked about, hey, we've done some strategic purchase commitments to lock in a large portion of the NAND supply for fiscal 2024 at today's prices. So, we're excited about that, being able to not have to deal with that when in the likely event it starts to go up. As we all know, NAND pricing is at an all-time fall. So, that's the walk from Q3 to Q4, how we did a little bit better and our outlook into fiscal 2024. Steven Fox : Great, that\u2019s super helpful. Thank you. George Kurian : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Amit Daryanani of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Irvin Liu : Hi. Thank you. This is Irvin Liu on for Amit. I wanted to double-click on the drivers of a public cloud ARR outperformance during the quarter. I think you referenced cloud storage services strength. But can you talk about what you saw in data management and cloud optimization. Is there anything to call out for Spot just given the increased focus on optimizing cloud spend? And I also have a follow-up. George Kurian : The CloudOps business was relatively flat sequentially. There were new customer additions and some optimizations within existing customers. The majority of the growth rate sequentially from Q3 to Q4 was driven by cloud storage, especially the consumption business with our cloud provider partners. Irvin Liu : Got it. Thank you. And then about 11% of your revenue is public sector. From a debt ceiling perspective, I wanted to ask, are there direct impacts we should be thinking about as it relates to your federal government exposure. Is there a potential for a delay in your accounts payable, or any potential changes in how you view the budget environment looking through the back half of calendar 2023? Mike Berry : Yes. So, thanks for the question. At this point, we don't expect any meaningful change in that business from an AR perspective or from a bookings perspective. We'll certainly watch it. We would expect this thing to have to resolve itself in the relatively near-term. At this point, we don't expect any material impact from all those discussions. Irvin Liu : Got it. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Shannon Cross of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. George, can you take a step back and maybe talk a bit from a higher level on how conversations with customers are going with regard to AI. And I'm thinking not just like near-term, but I'm trying to understand or figure out because I think we all are, what the various roles IT hardware will play in the AI proliferation that we're seeing? So, I'm wondering, well, you've got training, so do you need fast storage, and then you move to inferencing, so it could be more traditional storage or -- is that not correct? I'm just -- I'm wondering, I know you're having probably a lot of conversations with customers that could be beneficial to us. Thank you. George Kurian : Yes. We have done exceptionally well in the analytics, AI, deep learning environments. We have both technology leadership across multi-protocol, high-performance, scale-out storage and multi-cloud, which are super important buckets of what customers need to drive these analytic applications. And we have done -- we've doubled our business this past year to a very significant amount. I think the key use cases are business problems around, for example, in financial services, sentiment analysis, recommendation engines, advanced recommendations engines and e-commerce, precision medicine, cross-department clinical AI solutions. And then even last quarter, we had a substantial win in a new form of metaverse around autonomous driving, right? So, these are advanced analytics engines that are being deployed on very large-scale data sets. They typically require file and object and cloud integration. And today's environments are not the advanced LLM model, the majority of the business we see today are really around re-platforming from Hadoop to more modern environments as well as the use of advanced neural networks. We see the impending onslaught of ChatGPT and tools like that, where customers will take the OpenAI or open source generative AI model, but then build it on top of their own data sets, which require the storage that we have. So, we're excited about the future, and we have real strong performance in our AI and analytics business today. Shannon Cross : Thank you. That was helpful. Mike, can you talk a bit about -- I know OpEx is supposed to be flatter -- you're planning on it being flat this year. But I'm wondering, you delayed some investments and you've had some cost cutting in that. I'm wondering, given the gross margin outperformance in the relative strength you're seeing or improvement you're seeing, is there room to maybe reaccelerate some of those investments? Or is it just too early to make that call? Mike Berry : Yes, Shannon. So, I'd say we actually have accelerated some of those investments. We've talked about doing CONVERGE, which is our sales conference in person as well as INSIGHT. That's the first time in three years. We do a very good job. I give the team a lot of credit for reallocating dollars internally to really -- to reallocate to growth initiatives. You've seen us react very quickly from a product perspective in the last couple of months, C-Series and other things. So, I think at this point, we feel good about where we are from an OpEx perspective. We'll see how we get through the year. And when we talk about prudently managing the business for us, it is make sure we spend the money in the right areas, but we always want to make sure we're investing in growth. And that's what you have, and that's what we put in the guide for the year. Shannon Cross : Great. Thank you very much. Mike Berry : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. Please go ahead. Ananda Baruah : Hey, good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just picking up on Shannon's AI question, George, do you see an opportunity over time to have the product growth rate altered by AI on-prem. And actually, we just love maybe even a similar question for cloud software as well as this time? T hanks. George Kurian : I think the AI applications that drive business productivity are a topic of discussion in every CEO room around the globe because it is a key way to bring speed and operating efficiency to companies. And so many of the applications that we talked about help transform a company's business model. And so they will get prioritized in spending envelopes and we are really excited about our opportunity to capitalize on that. We have done the work not only to build high-performance storage, but in addition, build the integrations into all of the AI and data science tool chains that are common in the world and to enable a really flexible data pipeline that can start in the cloud where the tools are available, but then can be operated at a scale on the data in your data center. So, we're really excited about what the future holds and we're going to keep pushing forward. I see cloud and I see AI as two big opportunities for NetApp. We are super well positioned in both, and we look to take advantage of both of them going forward. Ananda Baruah : That's great. And I guess as a follow-up, can you just talk a little bit about the ability -- and I guess maybe even over what timeframe that the newer NAND technologies could have on share gains on-premise relative to HDD? Just how should we think about that dynamic and over what period of time? Thanks so much. George Kurian : I think the lower cost NAND technology that we've introduced in our products will become a bigger part of our business through the course of fiscal year 2024 and will be the biggest part of the flash storage growth rate in the industry over the next two or three years. These HDD replacement cycles are multiyear, right? I think if you saw the high-performance 15,000 HDD segment, it took multiple years to transition that footprint. And so 10,000, which is an even bigger part of the market will take many years to transition. But we're excited about our offerings, the start that we've had and the opportunity over the next many years. Ananda Baruah : Thanks a lot. Really appreciate it. Operator : The next question comes from Krish Sankar of Cowen. Please go ahead. Robert Mertens : Hello. This is Robert Mertens on for Krish. Thank you for taking my question. Congrats on the strong execution and guide with a targeted 2024 product margins of around 55%. Could you give a little bit more color on how the strategic purchases of SSDs plays into the target? And on the flip side, if there's any risk to competitors doing the same or headwinds if pricing declines, if there's any elasticity there? And then I have one follow-up. Mike Berry : Sure. It's Mike. So, let's take both of those. So, the guide of 55% assumes that's what we came out of Q4 with. There are some nice continued tailwinds going into next year. One is, of course, the continued shift to all-flash, which has higher margins. In addition to that, we do have a little bit of benefit from premium. So, we feel good about the 55% number. The strategic purchases really help, I'll call it hedge that number to lock the prices in that we have today. I would certainly assume given the lower price of NAND that other folks are doing similar exercises. And why we're at 55%, probably we want to make sure that we have some flexibility around pricing to your very point. So, to the extent that there are changes in the market pricing, we feel like we have that flexibility to stay within 55%, but still be able to get to our product revenue goals for the year. Robert Mertens : Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. And then just one more on the public cloud. Do you think the negative impact from cloud optimization efforts is behind us for the year? And would you mind sharing, just sort of which areas within your cloud portfolio are seeing the strongest growth? Thank you. George Kurian : I think it's premature to signal that cloud optimization is behind us. As we commented in our prepared remarks, I think that this customers will continue to manage their spend where that is on data center infrastructure or on public cloud. I think what we continue to see is the projects and applications that drive business performance especially core business growth are getting prioritized and invested. Those could be analytics, those could be AI, those could be digital manufacturing projects and on and on, right? I think where we have seen optimization and some amount of caution is in migration of enterprise workloads from data centers, the old lift and shift, I think people are taking a hard look at benchmarking both environments, whether it's public cloud or on-premises. So I think that's where we continue to see some optimization. In the plan for 2024, the real focus is on accelerating our hyperscaler storage. The storage that is sold alongside our cloud providers, it had a good quarter this quarter. We are uniquely positioned in the market, and we are serving a wider and wider range of applications with the strength of our technology. So, we're excited about that. Robert Mertens : Got it. Thank you for letting me ask the question. Operator : The next question comes from Tim Long of Barclays. Please go ahead. Tim Long : Thank you. Two, if I could as well, first, I was hoping you could talk a little bit, I think, last quarter, you talked about kind of increased focus given the large enterprises were a little bit more macro impacted, a little bit more focused on small and midsized businesses. Can you give us an update there on how that push into that customer class is going? And then second, if I could just come back to the QLC-based products. George, talking about it taking more share. I'm just curious how you think it's going to further proliferate your portfolio. So, are you going to start moving into different workloads, different use cases? How should we think about kind of progression of new products to help gain more share of all-flash and grow as a percent of your business? Thank you. George Kurian : Yes. So, maybe I can start with the portfolio. We've introduced three major expansions of our portfolio in the all-flash segment over the last four months to five months. We have capacity flash, the broadest, most feature-rich, most competitive capacity flash products in the industry. We've announced a set of entry flash products that are shipping, which brings our industry-leading software in an all-flash configuration at a price point that is perfect for midsized enterprises. And we introduced early this quarter and All SAN Array, which is a block-only storage configuration for customers that have large block storage environment and don't want to use unified storage for those offerings. So, major expansion to our product portfolio, the most significant expansion since we introduced our flash portfolio many years ago. So, I'm excited about that. That gives us opportunity to both expand wallet share in enterprise customers going after parts of the wallet that we used to not serve, but importantly, address the expanding opportunity within commercial customers. Our commercial segment has outperformed the enterprise segment throughout this fiscal year and again did so in Q4, representing the resilience of those customers to the macro spending environment. So, we feel good about that. We moved some resources within our spending envelope. We reprioritized some more resources to cover the commercial market for fiscal year 2024. Tim Long : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Nehal Chokshi of Northland Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Nehal Chokshi : Yes, thank you. Congrats on nice results. Your billings did decelerate quite a bit, the 15% year-over-year decline versus 7% year-over-year into Q3. So, given your guidance for analysts, it sounds like you do expect this billings to represent a low point in terms of the billings trends. Is that correct? And if so, why is that? Mike Berry : Yes. Hey, Nehal, it's Mike. So, if you take a look at Q4, so total revenue was down year-over-year by about 6%. Total billings were down by about 17%. When you take a look at the difference between billings and revenue, product revenue and product billings are basically the same because there is no change in deferred. What we saw in the second half, especially in Q4, is lower product bookings than correlated with less support bookings, specifically multiyear bookings that come with new sales. So, we do expect to see that come back as we go through next year. That's going to be the difference that you see in billings and revenue. So based on the guidance for the year, which is revenue down low to mid-single-digit percent, we do expect billings to be more flat to somewhere around plus or minus a couple of percentage points to do a little bit better than revenue, again, because of the contribution from support. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. Thank you very much. Mike Berry : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Simon Leopold of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to see if we could maybe unpack the public cloud business a little bit. In that last quarter, it seemed apparent that some of it was very much a recurring revenue stream and some of it was more sensitive and consumption-based. And I'd just like to get level set as to how to think of the composition of PCS as to what you would consider consumption-based and what you would consider truly recurring? Thank you. Mike Berry : Hey Simon, it's Mike. So, we'll do those two ways. We've given this detail in the past. So, cloud storage represents approximately 60% of the total cloud ARR. CloudOps represents about 40%. It stayed amazingly consistent through fiscal 2023. If you then look at what is consumption versus subscription, consumption is going to more than half of the business, and it's growing faster than subscription because the two products that are growing the fastest that George referenced, ANf and FSx, which are our first-party cloud storage products are consumption-based. So, you should expect to see that percentage of consumption continue to climb as we go through 2024. And then it doesn't mean that subscription is declining. It means that the consulting business is growing faster. And by consumption, we meant, hey, there is no starter end date. It's not an a or a multiyear subscription. It is a pay-go relationship. Simon Leopold : Thank you very much for that. Mike Berry : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from David Vogt of UBS. Please go ahead. David Vogt : Great. Thanks guys for squeezing me in. So, maybe this is a question for both George and Mike. When you think about sort of the product innovation engine and the new all-flash offerings versus sort of keeping your OpEx flat going forward, how should we think about sort of what you need to invest in the business as theoretically, there should be sort of a pretty steep growth rate in storage demand by some of your customers over the next couple of years? And then maybe as a quick follow-up. When you think about AI and what it means maybe for your business, how do you think about productivity gains and the uses of those productivity gains within NetApp. So does that flow through? Or is that reinvested into the business, whether it's go-to-market channels? I'm just trying to get a sense for how you think about what the benefit for AI would look like for you over the next couple of years as well? Thanks. George Kurian : Okay. Let me hit the sort of the broad picture, right, which is, listen, I think that we are disciplined managers of the business. We are balancing an uncertain macro with the strength of our product portfolio and the long-term opportunity. And I think what you'll see us is we continue to invest in the areas where we see the best returns so that we don't forgo the long-term health of the business. If we see the year outperform, we will certainly look at investing to further accelerate the business. But I think at this point in time, we want to be prudent in terms of managing the business just given the macro landscape. I think the second is, with regard to AI uses at NetApp, we have a broad range of users. We already use AI in our customer support and our product portfolio to help customers be able to have much reduced management requirements, right? So, we automate how data is managed in the system and automate self-healing of a system, as well as give customers intelligent chat bots, for example, so that they don't have to wait in queue for all of their basic questions. I think with regard to the big areas that we see opportunity is, is really in software development productivity. We have some exciting work already underway using some of these large language models and this profound opportunity for innovation there that we are leaning into. And you'll see the benefit of that in the ability to deliver more software to customers in a faster period of time. And I think those are some of the key areas of focus for us. Mike Berry : And David, it's Mike. If I could add one more from a go-to-market. We've talked a lot about building the customer success team, which adds productivity because we're able to shift renewals and cross-sells and upsells and then create capacity for our core sellers. So that's another initiative over the next couple of years. David Vogt : Great. Thanks George. Thanks Mike. Operator : The next question comes from Sidney Ho of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Sidney Ho : Great. Thank you. I have a cash flow question. So, I know Q1 is going to be impacted by all these strategic buys. But Mike, how are you thinking about free cash flow for the fiscal year, maybe the linearity of that? It sounds like you're expecting to return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders this year. At what point, do you think M&A will come back to be a priority? Thanks. Mike Berry : Yes. Hey, thanks Sidney, so let's start at the top. So, we ended the year fiscal 2023 with $1.1 billion of operating cash flow. We talked about the one-time items, which was the restructuring and the Danish tax case. So, we paid out about $85 million for those two items in the quarter. So, if you add those back, you had about $1.2 billion. We would expect going into next year, I would call that kind of the floor for cash flow going into next year. Working capital then will drive whether we can do a little bit better or not. We will have some lower cash outflow in Q1 because of the incentive compensation payments. So that will help Q1. The strategic buys will start a little bit in Q1 and then they'll build in Q2 and Q3. And that largely by the end of the year, it's not a big number. So, it's more of an intra-year impact. So, -- and again, we do expect cash flow plus or minus a couple of percent, Sidney to be pretty close to non-GAAP net income than it has been historically. As it relates to our capital allocation policy, hey, it's the continuation of what we talked about last March, two March's ago, with a little bit of a tweak, going into the year, we've always said that we've spent about 70% of our free cash flow on return to shareholders and reserve, call it, 30% for acquisitions. Going into fiscal 2024, we'll over-index on share buybacks, especially in the first half. It doesn't mean that we won't do any acquisitions. There's still a pipeline, we're still looking at them. But given where we are from an execution perspective and our focus on the business, we would rather reallocate that to share purchases -- repurchases, especially in the first half, and we'll see where it goes in the second half of the year. Sidney Ho : Okay, great. Thanks. Mike Berry : Thank you. Operator : Our last question will come from Louis Miscioscia of Daiwa Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Louis Miscioscia : Okay. Thank you, George. I think you had said earlier in your script that you're going to regain some all-flash array share. Maybe you could go into that in any more detail. Do you think that you did lose some share, but obviously, now with the new products coming out now in the second half that you're going to start to regain maybe if you could mention how much you think you might have lost and what you think you might be able to gain back? And then just a quick follow-up after that. George Kurian : Louis, first of all, if you look at the recent print from our competitors, I think we took share already in the current quarter. So, that's a good start to that dynamic. I think with regard to our overall kind of focus areas, we talked about expanding innovation to support our storage business. And so we've done a lot of product-led innovation into the market as well as broad innovation in storage life cycle management programs, the simplified licensing, the industry's most advanced and complete ransomware protection and recovery guarantees of lots of service innovations as well for our customers. We have aligned our go-to-market teams starting fiscal year 2024 to be laser focused on our flash portfolio. We think we've got a strong opportunity there. Last year, as I mentioned in our Q3 call, we had a compensation plan that was complex, having our frontline sales team sell a broad array of products, and that impacted execution. We have sharpened that starting FY 2024 per our commitment, and we have brought a much more focused approach to our cloud portfolio. So, I expect us to -- we have the strongest hybrid flash portfolio in the industry. We now have the broadest capacity flash portfolio in the industry and truly the only unified storage portfolio in the industry. Unified now includes block, file, object and cloud. And so we've redefined the landscape for unified to take it to the next level. So we're excited about the portfolio. We've got to execute, and we're focused on it. Louis Miscioscia : Okay. Then a very quick follow-up. On the guidance of down mid- to low single, what is the FX expectation for next year? I assume that you're giving guidance and actual -- what you expect revenues to perform, but I didn't know if you had an FX expectation in there. Mike Berry : Yes. Hey, Louis, it's Mike. Our expectation is it's not going to be a big impact at all, less than 1% based on where we sit today from a revenue perspective. So, we don't think FX is going to be a big hit. And that's a small benefit where we are. Who knows where FX rates go after all of the fund that we've had with the debt ceiling and other things. So, we don't think it's going to be a big driver next year. Louis Miscioscia : Okay. Best of luck on the new year. Mike Berry : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Louis. I'm going to pass it over to George for some closing remarks. George Kurian : Thanks Kris. Our focused execution yielded solid Q4 results, capping off fiscal year 2023 with record high annual operating margin and EPS, despite the slow demand environment. The fundamentals of our business model are sound and our confidence in our strategy and the health of long-term opportunity is unchanged. We will continue to prudently manage the elements within our control to drive margin expansion and improve profitability. I'm excited to enter FY 2024 with substantial new innovations and a more focused operating model to better address areas of priority spending within our customers. I look forward to updating you on our progress on next quarter's call. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation and you may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kris Newton : Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Mike Berry. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, including, without limitation, our guidance for the second quarter and fiscal year 2024; our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability and shareholder returns; and other growth initiatives and strategies. These statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may cause our actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC and on our website, including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP, unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to George. George Kurian : Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Q1 marks a solid start to FY '24 in what continues to be a challenging macroeconomic environment. We delivered revenue above the midpoint of guidance, while our operational discipline yielded operating margin and EPS above our guidance ranges. As I have outlined on previous calls, we are focused on : managing the elements within our control; reinvigorating efforts to drive better performance in our storage business; and building a more focused approach to our Public Cloud business. We are seeing positive early indicators from this plan to sharpen our execution, deliver growth, increase profitability, and further strengthen our position for long-term success. Looking at the results of the quarter, I am especially pleased with the reception to our recent product introductions. The AFF C-series has been the fastest ramping all-flash product launch in our history, with strong demand across all products in the family. Similarly, the AFF A150, our entry-level, high performance all-flash array, grew quickly in its first full quarter of shipping. Our Storage Lifecycle Program is also seeing good early uptake, driving longer-term commitments to NetApp as we help customers future-proof their environments with a world-class ownership experience. Building on this momentum, we introduced more storage innovation in Q1. We announced the ASA A-series, a family of SAN-specific all-flash arrays, supported by industry-leading data availability and efficiency guarantees. These systems are the only all-SAN storage arrays with virtual machine and application-granular data protection mechanisms. Complementing our unified storage offerings, they enable us to expand on the tens of thousands of customers who already use NetApp for block storage today and drive share gains in the $18 billion SAN market. In addition to delivering on our innovation agenda, we have implemented the go-to-market changes we outlined on the Q4 call, focusing our enterprise sellers on the flash opportunity and building a dedicated model for cloud. In May, we held our annual sales kickoff meeting, the first time we've gathered the global team in person since the pandemic. Everyone was energized by the innovation we're bringing to market and the objectives appropriately aligned to each team's strengths. Because many of the products we've introduced open new TAM for us, we are also including training to sharpen our attack on these opportunities. The changes have been well received, are already showing up in pipeline expansion, and should help drive top line growth in the second-half. Q1 Hybrid Cloud segment revenue of $1.3 billion was down 12% year-over-year. Our all-flash array business decreased 7% from Q1 a year ago to an annualized revenue run rate of $2.8 billion. The demand environment is unchanged from the last half of FY '23, with headwinds from enterprise continuing to weigh on product and AFA revenue. Additionally, as Mike will outline, the first-half of fiscal year '23 benefited from elevated backlog, impacting the year-over-year comparisons. In the past few quarters, every conversation I've had with customers and investors has touched on artificial intelligence. Generative AI is top of mind for everyone. While still in the early innings of this opportunity, AI is not a new topic for us. We have been a leader in storage for predictive AI and machine learning workloads since we introduced ONTAP AI, a joint NetApp and NVIDIA-proven architecture, in 2018. Today, hundreds of customers rely on NetApp's storage infrastructure and data management for their AI workloads, including some of the largest pharmaceutical, financial services and retail companies in the world. Effective predictive and generative AI projects depend on high quality, well-managed, unstructured data. The data pipeline and workflow typically involve data from multiple file and object sources across cloud and on premises. High performance, highly scalable hybrid cloud storage and data management is a core NetApp advantage and naturally positions us as a leader in this market and will continue to benefit us as the Gen AI market evolves. While early, we are already engaged with customers who are interested in fine-tuning large language models with their own data on-premises, as well as those who are leveraging the hyperscalers' Gen AI offerings on the public cloud together with the storage and data management capabilities of NetApp Cloud Volumes services. Accelerated by the rise of AI, data continues to grow in both volume and value. A company's data is its most valuable asset. Our robust cyber resilience portfolio helps customers ensure that they have the right enterprise data protection and security on-premises and in the cloud. With built-in features that protect and secure data and deliver rapid recovery based on AI and machine learning, our systems can proactively spot and counter malicious or anomalous actions. Our confidence in our industry-leading capabilities is underscored by the ransomware recovery guarantee we announced in Q1 and demonstrated by the fact that NetApp is the only enterprise storage vendor on the NSA's classified program components list. Now, turning to Public Cloud. I want to acknowledge our cloud results have not been where we want them to be and assure you we are taking definitive actions to hone our approach and get back on track. At the start of this year, we aligned our cloud sales specialists to our hyperscaler partners' go-to-market structures. Additionally, we are in the process of a strategic review to sharpen the focus of our cloud portfolio, expand on the success of first party services and improve subscription performance. We will have more details to share with you on our next call. That said, Public Cloud segment revenue in Q1 was $154 million, an increase of 17% year-over-year. Public Cloud DBNRR declined to 107%. Within these numbers, strength in first party and marketplace consumption services was masked by weakness in our subscription services. Let me emphasize that our strategic focus is on first party cloud storage services, and we continue to see customer expansion and deepening partnerships, as well as revenue and ARR growth in this part of the portfolio. Our expectations for FY '24 Public Cloud revenue are reflected in the guidance Mike will walk you through. First party storage services, branded and sold by our cloud partners, position us uniquely and represent our biggest opportunity. Our partnerships with the cloud providers are strong and delivering growth. Our close and long-standing relationship with Microsoft Azure continues to deliver solid growth. Likewise, our partnership with Google remains strong. And in the coming weeks, you can expect to hear exciting news about the expansion of our partnership. Our relationship with AWS is also yielding positive results. As expected, we are starting to win large enterprise deployments with FSx for NetApp ONTAP. We were chosen to be the cloud storage infrastructure for a global sportswear manufacturer's SAP HANA deployment. FSxN was the only storage service that could meet the company's mission-critical service level, availability, and recovery requirements. This is a large, long-term SAP project that will continue to develop and grow over the coming years, driving significant consumption of FSxN capacity. Once completed, it will be one of the largest SAP environments on AWS. In the face of the challenging macro, demand remains muted, and sales cycles remain elongated. Although customers continue to exhibit caution, they are moving forward with strategic initiatives, prioritizing investments in applications and technologies that drive business productivity and growth. Our modern approach to hybrid, multi-cloud infrastructure and data management enables IT organizations to leverage data across their entire estate simply, securely and sustainably. Customers turn to NetApp to help them increase the performance and reliability of their digital and cloud transformational projects. Looking forward, our priorities are clear. We will continue to tightly manage the elements within our control, reinvigorate efforts to drive better performance in the storage business, and continue to refine our Public Cloud business. Early results indicate we are on track to drive margin expansion and earnings growth year-over-year while yielding top-line growth in the back half of fiscal year '24. Before turning the call over to Mike, I want to thank the NetApp team for their continued focus. I also want to remind you we'll be hosting our INSIGHT user conference in person in Las Vegas this October. We hope to see you there. Mike Berry : Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. We executed a solid quarter in a challenging macro environment, hitting or exceeding all our guidance ranges. We are delivering on our commitments, evident in our solid Q1 results. Before I get into the financial details, let me walk you through the key themes for the quarter. As a reminder, all numbers discussed are non-GAAP unless otherwise noted. Our disciplined operational management and the strong customer acceptance of our innovation continues to pay off. We expect improved execution and new products will drive growth and operating margin expansion as we move through the second-half of the year. As expected, Q1 consolidated gross margin was strong. Product margin came in at 55%. Given our expectations for competitive dynamics and product mix, we remain confident in our projection that product margin will hold at these levels through the remainder of the fiscal year. Cash from operations was a first quarter all-time high. Operating cash flow benefited from the reduction of premiums, as well as lower component pricing and incentive compensation payouts. Over the course of fiscal year \u201824, cash flow should normalize, with operating cash flow tracking relatively in line with non-GAAP net income. We returned approximately 120% of free cash flow to stockholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, reducing Q1 fiscal \u201824 share count by almost 4% year-over-year. As we discussed during last quarter's call, we intend to return 100% of free cash flow this year. Now, to the details of the quarter. Q1 billings of $1.3 billion decreased 17% year-over-year. Revenue of $1.4 billion decreased 10% year-over-year. The challenging macro environment continued to pressure IT spending. However, as George pointed out, we are well aligned to customers' priority investments and remain confident our go-to-market changes and product innovations will drive growth in the second-half of fiscal year \u201824. Hybrid Cloud revenue of $1.3 billion was down 12% year-over-year. Product revenue of $590 million was down 25%. Remember that first-half fiscal year 2023 revenue, most notably product revenue, benefited from elevated levels of backlog, which impacts the year-over-year comparisons. Support revenue of $611 million grew 2% year-over-year. Public Cloud ARR grew 6% year-over-year to $619 million. Public Cloud revenue of $154 million increased 17% from Q1 a year ago. First party and marketplace services grew as customers continue to choose solutions based on NetApp technology for mission-critical and cloud native workloads. This growth was offset by underperformance in subscription services. As George noted earlier, Public Cloud did not meet our expectations for the quarter, and we are taking action to hone our approach and reaccelerate growth. Q1 consolidated gross margin of 71% came in above our guidance, up 400 basis points from a year ago, and again reaching an all-time company high. Product gross margin was 55%, in line with expectations. As we discussed on the Q4 call, we made strategic purchase commitments to lock-in record low NAND pricing and mitigate rising prices in the future. NAND prices continued to decline in Q1, and we are still positioned favorably versus the market. The potential for increased price competition is factored into our expectations and we remain confident in our ability to hold product gross margin consistent at this level through the year. Our recurring support business continues to be highly profitable with gross margin of 92%. Public cloud gross margin improved to 67% from 66% last quarter. As expected, operating expenses of $703 million were flat year-over-year and grew 4% from Q4'23. The sequential increase was driven by annual merit increases and a reset of incentive compensation, as well as expenses related to our in-person sales kick-off meeting. Q1 again highlighted the strength of our business model and disciplined operational execution with operating margin of 22%, ahead of expectations. EPS of $1.15 was also above the high end of our guidance. Operating cash flow was $453 million in Q1, an increase of 61% year-over-year, driven by lower supply chain payments and variable compensation, partially offset by lower collections. In Q1, DSO decreased to 41 and inventory turns improved to 13. Free cash flow increased 94% year-over-year to $418 million, helped by strong operating cash flow and lower CapEx. During the quarter, we returned $506 million to stockholders through shares repurchased and cash dividends, ending the quarter with approximately $600 million in net cash. We have approximately $1 billion remaining on our existing repurchase authorization. Our balance sheet remains healthy. Total deferred revenue as of the end of Q1 was $4.2 billion, up slightly from a year ago. We ended the quarter with approximately $3 billion in cash and short-term investments. Now turning to guidance. We are reiterating our guidance for the full-year. Our total revenue guide is unchanged, with revenue down low to mid-single-digits year-over-year, measured on a percentage basis. Based on our Q1 results and updated projections, we expect Public Cloud revenue growth to come in lower than initially expected primarily due to softness in our subscription services. This minor weakness is expected to be at least offset by strength in our Hybrid Cloud revenue. We continue to expect fiscal year '24 consolidated gross margin to be roughly 70%, operating margin to be approximately 25%, and EPS to be in the range of $5.65 to $5.85. We expect Q2 revenue to range between $1.455 billion and $1.605 billion, which at the midpoint implies a decline of 8% year-over-year. If FX rates stay at end-of-July levels, we would see nearly 2 points of FX tailwinds to revenue. As I called out earlier, first-half fiscal year \u201823 revenue benefited from elevated levels of backlog due to last year\u2019s supply chain constraints, which impacts the year-over-year comparisons. We expect Q2 consolidated gross margin to be roughly 70%, and operating margin to be approximately 24%. EPS should be in the range of $1.35 to $1.45. In closing, I want to thank our employees, customers and investors for their commitment and investment in NetApp. I am confident in our ability to help our customers successfully achieve their digital and cloud transformation goals. We are well aligned to priority IT investments and are committed to deliver sustainable, long-term value for our stockholders. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Kris to open the Q & A. Kris? Kris Newton : Thanks, Mike. Operator, let\u2019s begin the Q&A. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Sidney Ho : Great. Thanks for doing the call. So last quarter, you guys talked about spending for large enterprises were cautious, where obviously you guys are overexposed. That doesn't seem like that has changed that much. From your conversation with customers, do you have a sense when demand could start picking up, maybe based on utilization data or whatnot? First, just give us some historical context at what utilization rate level do you start seeing demand pick up, and do you think that will be quite any different this cycle? I mean, while you\u2019re at it talk about the trends in small and medium businesses as well? Thanks. George Kurian : Overall -- thank you for the question. Overall, the spending environment this past quarter was unchanged from what we saw in the second half of the prior fiscal year. Our mid-sized enterprise business across the globe and public sector did better than large enterprise. Within large enterprise, as we noted, the same verticals remained cautious in spending, service provider, high-tech and, to a lesser extent, financial services. With regard to their spending criterion, they are spending on strategic projects but are running infrastructure, broadly speaking, hotter than meaning at higher levels of utilization than they typically do and what we typically tell them is best practice. That is common in such macro environments, but it's not a long-term trend. I think we expect them as we progress through the fiscal year for them to start to expand investment because they cannot run systems that hard. As we noted in our prepared remarks and in prior calls, we do not expect the macro to change substantially to support our guidance for the year. Our guidance for the year reflects our confidence both in the changes that we made in go-to-market as well as in our product portfolio that we recently introduced. Sidney Ho : Okay, thank you. Operator : The next question is from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. I have two quick follow-ups. George, I want to go back to the big picture and revisit the topic of repatriation. How do you see generative AI strengthening this argument that there will be repatriation enterprises have better ownership of the data that, that would actually help with a faster adoption? Is there any update? Is there any feedback from the -- your conversation from your enterprise customers that you can share? And a quick follow-up. Can you provide a mix of a QLC NAND that you're procuring? And how do you see that changing towards the end of the calendar year? George Kurian : With regard to Gen AI projects, which we are already engaged in, in a number of customers, we see a mix of use cases. I would say there are three common patterns. One is unstructured data. The second is the need for consistent data management, both security and privacy are hot topics as well as the lineage of data so that they can keep track of which version of Gen AI model is the best and most accurate. And then the third is from a deployment architecture, we are seeing them engage in both on-prem discussions, as well as public cloud discussions. In public cloud, the advantages are much faster feature velocity, as well as prepackaged models available on the public cloud. With the on-prem environments, the major sensitivity is the data being kept in a restricted location. So we intend to benefit from both. I don't think that it is a meaningful driver of repatriation at this point in the discussion maybe. There we're seeing a mix of public cloud and on-prem environments. Mike Berry : And then, hey, Mehdi, it's Mike. On the QLC, we're not going to break-out specific numbers, but we would say we are procuring more of that. We started to see the pickup. We'll see how the rest of the year goes, but we do expect that to continue as a percentage as we go through fiscal '24. Mehdi Hosseini : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Joe Cardoso : Hey, thanks for the question. This is Joe Cardoso on for Samik. Just one question from me. You reported a strong gross margin performance in the quarter and I was just curious if you could quantify how much of the improvement were is it related to premium? The premium benefits, strategic purchases, et-cetera, that you've highlighted and how we should think about that tailwind as we progress through this year, including and excluding the expected price competition that you have embedded into the guide? And then just real quickly, a clarification on that last part, like are you guys actually seeing price competition currently from your competitors? Thanks. Mike Berry : Hey Joe, it's Mike. So, on your question, we've talked a lot about premiums and as we talked about last-time, we're super-excited and not have to talk about them anymore. So largely in Q1, all of those premiums have I would say gone away, not only from a P&L perspective, but cash. We talked about that number was anywhere typically between, call it, $30 million and $40 million a quarter, sometimes it bumped up to $50 million, so call it an average of about $40 million. That -- we got a good bit of that. We did not have to accrue in Q4 and then the rest hold to Q1. So it's 55% last quarter, 55% this quarter. And now premiums are fully out-of-the number. So as you look-forward, it's one of the reasons why we feel confident in the 55% guide. There -- hey, there has always been price competition. We see it in certain geographies or certain customers. We haven't seen any material change to that in our guide. We do expect that we will be -- we will need to be, call it, marginally more aggressive in certain situations, but certainly nothing significantly different than we are today. Joseph Cardoso : Thanks for the color. Mike Berry : Yes. Operator : The next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Michael Tsvetanov : Yes, thank you, guys. This is Michael on behalf of Aaron. I wanted to ask, your ARR in the quarter -- your ARR growth in the quarter slowed quite a bit. And I know you guys have pushed out your $2 billion sort of target, but I just wanted to take a step-back and I think about like to your first billion, what -- how would you describe the trajectory to getting there and maybe timing? If you can kind of just help us think about where we go from here? Thank you. George Kurian : Yes, I think first of all, our -- we have two models in which we serve customers; the consumption model, which is essentially a pay-as-you-go utility model; and then a subscription model, which is where the customer pays for a certain amount of capacity or managed units or capability and then renews that on an annual basis or a term basis. Then consumption part of our business has grown to about three quarters of our total business, roughly speaking. Of our cloud business, subscription is the quarter. And if you look at the last quarter's performance, the cloud storage and consumption businesses continue to perform well. They grew year-on-year. Their dollar-based net retention rate was at the industry average, industry norms. Subscription is where we saw a challenge, both a small part of cloud storage subscription as well as CloudOps and we are conducting a review and we'll get you an update at the next quarterly call about our plans for that part of our business. Michael Tsvetanov : Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And if I can just add one more. I just want to understand your all-flash business is down about 7%. And I can appreciate the macro backdrop there, but I'm wondering if you can just help me understand the share kind of trends? And maybe your best estimate where that's been this quarter? How it's changing? And kind of what your expectations are moving through the year? Thank you. George Kurian : I think first of all, the year-on-year compare for our flash product business is impacted by last year benefiting from elevated levels of backlog that we shipped in the comparable quarter last year. If you -- if you remove that backlog, flash actually grew year-on-year this quarter and we saw strong growth from our capacity flash products. We expect overall flash portfolio to grow as a percentage of our business through the course of the year. The first-quarter customers are still qualifying our capacity flash products, the C-Series. And so we weren't able to move all of our intended customer environments over to all-flash yet, but they are headed that way. And so we feel really good about both the go-to-market changes that are starting to reflect in pipeline expansion as well as in the flash product portfolio that we have. And you should see that reflected in growth in the second-half of the year. With regard to share gains, our expectation based on what the others have guided is that we have picked-up the second position in share in the market behind Dell. Operator : The next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Victor Chiu : Hi, this is Victor Chiu in for Simon Leopold. You guys noted that the product gross margin is expected to hold for the remainder of the year, but I think the latest industry forecasts and commentary from NAND manufacturers implies that the market experiences a sharp overcorrection next year. Can you help us understand how this impacts your expectations for the next fiscal year and whether you've secured any pricing agreements for flash media beyond this fiscal year? Mike Berry : Yes. Hey, Victor, it's Mike. So, hey, we haven't guided for fiscal '25, but let us walk you through that. As we talked about between pre-buys and price locks, we have secured a large portion of our NAND purchases for fiscal '24, not all of it, you never want to hedge the whole bucket, but we feel really good about that. In addition, some of those agreements do flow into fiscal '25, it's not a majority at this point. So where we stand today as we feel really good about where we are at \u201824, we have some of that rolling into '25 and we are certainly looking for about -- what should we do? We'll do a lot more work on that, call it, in the next 90-days and update you on the next call. As you know, it's a very changing market. We want to make sure it be prudent and think through that, but it is something that we are looking hard at. Victor Chiu : Okay, that's helpful. And just on the other side of the legacy part of the business, the last several quarters have seen pretty sharp declines in shipments of legacy spinning drives. I know historically, there has not very much correlation between storage media trends, the storage systems, but more recently, one of your competitors have asserted that there won't be any new spinning disk drives manufacturer in five years. Do you have any view on this commentary? Do you agree with this perspective and how do you see this impacting NetApp I guess over the long-run? George Kurian : Listen, I think we have the best spinning media and the best flash technologies in the market. I think that's reflected by the richness of our feature set, the flexibility of our operating system and increasingly the data security functionality that natively integrated into our offerings. I think that the outlines of what our competitors have talked about is a long-time. And so we give our customers choice and we'll continue to invest in a broad range of technologies that meet the right price performance points. When you cannot support a type of technology, like our competitors cannot, then you have to throw grenades and say that that technology doesn't exist because you frankly can't support it. Victor Chiu : Okay, so you think that that's extreme view that that the past legacy -- is that spinning drives will be gone in five years, that's extreme in your opinion? George Kurian : Five years is a long-time in technology as we've all learned. Victor Chiu : Yes. Okay, okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Asiya Merchant : Great, thank you for taking my question. In the past, I think you guided for some linearity on first-half versus second-half. So just wanted to clarify if that still holds for the remainder of this year? And just back on the public-cloud side of things. I know it's guiding to a little bit lower relative to prior expectations, due to the subscription weakness. How should we think about just the linearity? I mean, are we expecting these run-rates to kind of continue to have any more insight into how we should think about the growth rates for the rest of the year? Are we still looking at something -- are we still expecting from a year-on-year basis as the comps get easier in the back-half of fiscal '24 to have cloud revenues accelerate from this point? Thank you. George Kurian : Yes, thank you for the question. So, on the first question on linearity, based on the midpoint of guidance, we are still assuming about 48% revenue in the first-half and 52% in the second, pretty close to round in which is very consistent with what we did last quarter. So, no big change there. And that's very consistent with the linearity that we've shown historically. Also, our Q2 guide is up about 7% quarter-on-quarter, which is well within our historical linearity as well. On the cloud revenue number, so we're not going to update the guidance. We had originally thought and forecasted somewhere around, call it, mid-teens growth in that cloud revenue business. Even if as you look at the historical numbers, that cloud revenue, and we're not forecasting it, well, if it stays where it's at today, there would still be growth year-over-year because of the growth last year. So we have baked all of that into our full-year number, so we feel good about where we are on that guide. We'll see how the rest of the year goes. But at this point, we've reflected that in our full-year number. Asiya Merchant : Great, thank you. George Kurian : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Krish Sankar : Yes, hi, thanks for taking my question. I have two high-level questions in AI for George. Our understanding is that most of the benefit of storage, as we put all-flash unified file and object solution; A, is that assessment accurate or are you seeing hybrid HDD solutions being used in AI workloads today? And second, for unified cloud and object, can you speak about your product portfolio there and your competitive position, compared to other solutions like FlashBlade from Pure Storage and PowerScale from Dell. And also if unified filing object solutions are more expected of benefit from AI, it's a market share that's similar to market-share in other storage solutions like block and file? Thank you. George Kurian : Listen, I think that the first comment that I would make is AI primarily offerings today on unstructured data, whether it's predictive AI using unstructured data to analyze images or audio files or generative AI that analysis text on various types of document formats, unstructured data is the priority. Second, I think with regard to unified file and object, listen, we created unified storage and we have a really strong track-record in unified across file, block, object and cloud. And I think that is the new definition of unified rather than little systems that tried to say that they've got one protocol or the other. I think the third is when you talk about AI, it's a broad topic. And therefore, what customers typically have is versions of data that they used to trade different models. At the time that they are running the trading workload, they typically store it on a high-performance landscape like all-flash system. But they keep those models available so that they can go back and look at when they make changes to models and data sets and what the implications are for accuracy. And so the archival life cycle of that data is usually on disk or on cloud. And then I think the last point I would make is, listen, we are seeing clients use hybrid workflows. Public cloud is a strong place where a lot of the developers and data science teams are beginning their Workflows, either Vertex in and Google or Sagemaker in Amazon and our solutions on public cloud give us a strong position to start with the data science team at the start of these AI projects. Krish Sankar : Thank you, guys. Operator : The next question is from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead. David Vogt : Great, thanks. Hey, George. Hey Mike. I had some phone difficulties. So I apologize if you addressed this. On sort of the AI sort of strategy going forward versus like mass capacity storage, what are you hearing from your customers from the enterprise side in terms of what the priority looks like from an investment perspective? I know your mass capacity product is seeing some really strong traction out of the gate. But over the longer term, how do you think the mix between high-end, high-performance storage and mass capacity trends? And then maybe just on Public Cloud real quickly, I know this has been sort of a fits and starts business for you. When you think about how much of maybe an impact on your management bandwidth, how are you thinking about that business longer term now? I know you're talking about giving out updated outlook maybe next quarter. But do you still think it has the same opportunity to be a key driver for the business? Or is it maybe a little bit less of a longer-term opportunity today than you might have thought 90 days ago or even a year ago at this point? Thanks. George Kurian : Let me hit on those two points. I think the first is with regard to AI, again, as I mentioned, it's a broad life cycle of tasks. There are light portions of the life cycle that run on extremely high-performance systems. And then there are portions of the life cycle where the data sits on more fine-tuned capacity-oriented systems because you want to keep versions of your models available. And so I look at it like any type of workload, there's a portion of time where the workload has data that's hot and then there's a portion of its life cycle where you want to keep a copy of the data. With regard to the overall all-flash array outlook, listen, I think we have one quarter in. We are really pleased with the adoption of our capacity flash products. Overall, what I see is all-flash will grow at higher than our total storage business and will be a bigger part of our mix. Within all-flash, the capacity flash products will grow more quickly than the performance flash products because one is attacking the next tranche of upgrades and refreshes, which is the 10-K drive market while the high-performance products have already been in market for a long period of time. So I think that's how they break that out. With regard to cloud, I think that, listen, the opportunity is strong. We are excited about the growth of our cloud storage services all of the capabilities and the pace of customer adoption of those services. We have more exciting news to come with Google around the work we're doing with them, both with regard to the expansion of our offerings as well as new use cases in the Google Cloud that you'll hear more about in the next couple of weeks. And I think that our approach right now is to focus on the best parts of our cloud portfolio have a dedicated go-to-market model that has been well received by the hyperscalers. We're 1 quarter in. The cloud storage and consumption offerings performed well. We have work to do on the subscription side. We'll give you an update next quarter. Our overall view of cloud has not changed. David Vogt : Great, thanks guys. Operator : The next question is from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Please go ahead. Steven Fox : Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. I just wanted to follow-up on some of those last comments, George, especially on subscription. I guess I'm wondering, obviously, you want to grow faster in public cloud. But -- and the subscription business being down, it seems like it's consistent with the type of macro we're in. So I guess I'm trying to understand more specifically, given all the other stuff that's going on in terms of public cloud, in terms of refining the business, why the subscription business is especially disappointing here as opposed to maybe riding it out until you start to see an up cycle? Thanks. George Kurian : Yes. Listen, I think that we are not the only company in the world that had a subscription cloud software business that got impacted. When we saw the trends for optimization, you generally see the consumption part of the business get optimized quickly because you are on a pay-as-you-go contract. I think the subscription part usually gets affected at the time of a renewal of a subscription or a decision to expand or not expand a subscription. That doesn't excuse the fact that we wanted to do better in the subscription part of our business. I think we've got work to do to refine our portfolio, sharpen the value proposition, optimize pricing in certain cases to meet customers' expectations, and we'll give you an update on that. We're already working on those. We'll give you an update on that on the next call. Steven Fox : Great, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you. It sounds from your comments like you had at least 7 to 8 points of backlog-related headwind from last year in AFA. Can you help us think through is the magnitude sort of similar in fiscal 2Q? And for fiscal second-half on the Hybrid Cloud side, is it fair to think that there's going to be a 4 to 5 point acceleration in growth? And as you look at the estimates that the Street's modeling is kind of -- that's kind of what is implied. And I'm wondering if you could talk about what is the upside that you're seeing in hybrid that's offsetting the weakness in public, given your relative overall guidance didn't change? Thank you so much. Mike Berry : Hey, Wamsi, it's Mike. Thanks for the question. So let's go through the numbers. So yes, you're pretty close on the impact. It was about [Technical Difficulty] So last quarter, we talked about, if you adjust for the backlog benefit in the first half of fiscal '23 and you compared our growth this first-half with the second-half of last year when we declined about 5% or 6%, we expect the growth to be better than that, still slightly negative. That is about the same in Q1 and Q2, so Q2 has about the same impact. Based on the midpoint of guidance, we do expect Hybrid Cloud then to have growth in the second-half, the low-single-digit growth based on the guidance that we gave. And we're still comfortable with that based on the progress that we saw in Q1, especially related to C-Series. The focus that we have on the new products, as well as the go-to-market changes, we do expect those to bear more fruit as we go into the second-half, and that's based on what we've seen not only in pipelines and then also sales activity. So overall, yes, that would be accurate, and that's what gives us confidence as we go into the second-half of the year. Wamsi Mohan : Okay, great. Thank you so much. Operator : The next question is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Meta Marshall : Great, thanks. Maybe as a first question, you noted that the storage and consumption piece of the business you expected that, that was growing about market rate this quarter. I guess just is kind of the assumption there that essentially optimization has stabilized, and we are starting to see growth again? I just kind of want to get a sense of where you guys are in terms of what you -- if we're at kind of the bottom of optimization and seeing growth again or if we're still kind of in this bottom out period? And then as a second question, just if there's any kind of surprises in terms of customer types or workload types that have been more interested in C-Series than kind of initially expected? Thanks. George Kurian : On the first question, Meta, I think that what we saw was continued good pace of customer additions, which means that there are cloud projects and ongoing deployment of workloads on the cloud. We saw the pace of optimization slowdown as customers have basically done the easy stuff. And so now they probably are more cautious about what further to optimize. Within the latter bucket, the customers that have been optimizing, there are early signs of them starting to do new projects on our technology, but they haven't ramped those projects yet. So the benefit we saw within the quarter was new customers and new workloads as opposed to the ones that optimize reaccelerating spending. With regard to the second question, capacity flash, we were selling high-performance flash into use cases where capacity flash was a better product. Those were in two flavors. One would be more of a general purpose private cloud environment where customers don't care about the performance of a particular application, but generally want good performance. And so that was one and then smaller environments where we had the A150 product that was also introduced at a lower price point than any other flash product. Both of them saw strength. And I think we saw strength in the mid-market segment, broadly speaking, across all of our products. Meta Marshall : Great, thank you. Operator : The next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Yes. Thanks for taking my questions. I got caught off in the middle, so I apologize if this was addressed. But on the Public Cloud, can you just talk about what are the reasons that led to the miss of here? Was it macro or there any micro impact as well? And then when you talk about the initiatives you're taking, is it more around just aligning your specialists to the hyperscalers? Or are you taking any more incremental initiatives? Just love to understand macro versus micro impact? And then what are the initiatives you're specifically taking to address them? George Kurian : I think broadly speaking, if you look at our cloud business, roughly three-quarter is consumption and one-quarter is subscription. That mix has shifted in favor of consumption a meaningful amount over the last year as customers have preferred more of the marketplace and first-party offerings over some of our more traditional subscription type, bring your own license offerings. I think the impact that we saw was more pronounced in subscription rather than consumption. Consumption performed quite well. And so I would point out that it's in the one-quarter of the business in subscription. Then second, with regard to whether it was macro or micro, it was a mix of things. I think it was -- in some customers, clearly, it was related to budget constraints, where upon renewal, they said, listen, I want to use less of the product and only use it for the most mission-critical environment, some of our monitoring tools. In other cases, it was the customer not being ready to deploy the product and so we've taken a couple of actions. One action is to, as we said, conduct a review of our products, make sure we have the right products tailored to the right use cases that pricing is set up right, that the value share between us and the customers set up right, that is already underway. We've implemented some of those changes. We'll give you a more fulsome update. And then with regard to go-to-market, we've, as we noted, implemented both a dedicated cloud specialist organization aligned with the hyperscalers and also implemented customer success so that customers can get expertise from NetApp on how to use the products. It's early. We've seen some good evidence of progress, but there's more work to be done. Amit Daryanani : Got it. That's really helpful. And Mike, if I could just have you clarify Q1 free cash flow, I think, was much better than what I had expected and what you typically be in Q1, I think, as well. Can you just touch on maybe what drove that, if there was a bit of a pull-in or something with some of the stuff? And any view on fiscal year free cash flow, given the strong performance here? Mike Berry : Yes. Awesome. Thanks for the question on cash. Yes, there was -- it was quite a bit better than we thought. There was three moving parts. Amit, I would say you've seen billings come in lower in the last two quarters. So collections were down year-over-year. But what really drove the operating and free cash flow was the reduction in our supply chain spending. And that's not only premiums. It's the quantity of components that came down significantly. And then, of course, pricing came down as well. So that, if you think about the rest of the year, we should expect to continue to see some of that benefit not as big as in Q1 because that compares to Q1 of last year when we were still, I'll call it, bulking up on inventory because we expect the growth before things slowed down in the middle of the year. You know, the one-time benefit year-over-year, which unfortunately is we paid a good bit less in incentive compensation. So that helped drive it as well. And then lower CapEx helped drive free cash flow as well. And we did say, hey, the $239 million we spent last year, we expect to be the high and we expect that to continue to come down. As you look at the rest of the year, we do expect on a full-year basis it to track pretty close to non-GAAP net income, which guidance is somewhere around $1.2 billion. I do want to note, though, hey, folks in Q2 -- and this happens every year, keep in mind, it's the quarter we pay most of our taxes. So we pay almost $88 million in repatriation taxes and then we make our U.S. federal tax payment as well. So expect Q2 to be down from Q1, and it's been like that every year. And then in the back half, following more typical trends. So thanks for the question. Amit Daryanani : Thank you. Operator : And the final question today comes from Shannon Cross with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Shannon Cross : Thank you very much. I guess my first question, George, can you talk about ONTAP AI from a competitive standpoint? Are you seeing this as an ability basically to sell into your existing customer base you are using ONTAP and comfortable with it in that? Or is this something that, from a competitive differentiation standpoint, can actually drive switchers to NetApp's product set? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you. George Kurian : We sell ONTAP AI into data science teams and AI teams, whether they are in our installed base or net new accounts. They are -- it's a very verticalized selling model. So for example, in pharmaceuticals, we work with teams on rapid drug discovery, clinical data analysis so that they can apply really high-performance GPUs from NVIDIA with -- together with large-scale data storage from NetApp. We could also do the same thing. For example, in manufacturing, we are selling into advanced digital twin prototypes where they are optimizing manufacturing yield and sort of accelerating development. So I think those are the key areas that we have sort of net new budget, net new customer landscape. Our advantages are high performance, large scale advanced demo management, the best in the industry, and it's highly integrated into the data science toolkit of our customers. And then increasingly, we also now have the same versions of 2 chains running on all the leading public clouds, and you'll hear more about that in the next couple of weeks at the Google conference. Shannon Cross : Okay. And then I guess we've asked you about AI from sort of an opportunity standpoint. But how are you thinking about utilizing generative AI internally within NetApp to increase productivity, save costs and maybe, I don't know, improve customer experience? Thanks. George Kurian : We already use AI tools in three ways. One is to accelerate software development and to increase the pace at which we can deliver more innovation to customers. The second, to integrate AI into our products and services so that we can automatically detect, for example, ransomware attacks or impending risks from running systems harder than they should be or various other things and give customers proactive advice rather than reactive response. And then the third is across the range of our businesses, everything from marketing collateral, documentation, multilingual support as well as chatbots. In customer service, we have AI capabilities already being integrated. And Gen AI is the next version of that. So there are lots of exciting projects underway on that. Thank you, Shannon. Shannon Cross : Thank you. George Kurian : Let me close with a few comments. The strong customer reception to the substantial innovation we have brought to market has got in FY '24 to a solid start, despite the choppy macro backdrop. We are laser-focused on our FY '24 priorities to be prudent stewards of the business, tightly managing the elements within our control, to reinvigorate efforts to drive better performance in our storage systems business and to build a more focused approach to our Public Cloud business. Early results of this focus indicate we are on track to drive margin expansion and earnings growth while yielding top line growth in the back half of the year. I am absolutely delighted by the positive reception to our new products, the differentiation and continued growth of our first-party public cloud storage services and our exciting innovation road map. I hope to see you at INSIGHT and look forward to updating on our continued progress on next quarter's call. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kris Newton : Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Mike Berry. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, including, without limitation, our guidance for the third quarter and fiscal year 2024; our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability and shareholder returns; and other growth initiatives and strategies. These statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may cause our actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the documents we file from time to time with the SEC and on our website, including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP, unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are available on our website. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to George. George Kurian : Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Q2 improved on our solid start to FY 2024 in what continues to be a challenging macroeconomic environment. We delivered revenue above the midpoint of guidance while our operational discipline yielded company all-time highs for gross margin, operating margin, and EPS. We remain relentlessly focused on managing the elements within our control while driving better performance in our storage business and building a more focused approach to our Public Cloud business. We are seeing positive results from these actions, with increased profitability and a stronger position for delivering long-term growth. In Q2, we held our INSIGHT user conference where I witnessed the tangible excitement for the silo-free innovation, our unified data storage provides. It was invigorating to be with the thousands of attendees and hear stories of the extraordinary outcomes NetApp delivers for our customers. NetApp is at the forefront of the evolution of the storage industry, helping our customers turn disruption into opportunity with intelligent data infrastructure. Today\u2019s organizations need storage infrastructure that harnesses the power of public and hybrid clouds while keeping data secure and protected from ransomware attacks. They need infrastructure that supports dynamic workloads like AI, cloud-native, and open-source applications. And they need infrastructure that helps to create more sustainable data centers. Only NetApp delivers an entire architecture of unified data storage solutions based on one operating system, ONTAP, that supports any application, any data type, and spans on-premises and multiple cloud environments. This comprehensive architecture delivers unparalleled simplicity of management, simplicity of deployment, and consistency of automation, all unified by common APIs and a single control plane. We further elevate the customer experience with our BlueXP sustainability dashboard and NetApp Advance a common set of programs and guarantees that include Storage Life Cycle program, which removes the burden of upgrade cycles as well as storage efficiency, ransomware recovery and data availability guarantees. Intelligent data infrastructure combines unified data storage, integrated data services, and intelligent operations, so customers can operate with seamless flexibility to deploy new applications, unify their data for AI and simplify data protection in a world of limited IT resources, rapid data growth and increased cybersecurity threats. Looking at the results of the quarter, momentum from new products and the go-to-market changes we made at the start of the year drove 10% quarter-over-quarter growth in hybrid cloud segment revenue to $1.4 billion. Our all-flash array business benefited from the growth of the AFF C-Series increasing 14% from Q1 to an annualized revenue run rate of $3.2 billion. The AFF C-Series all-flash array continues to exceed our expectations, delivering new-to-NetApp customers and numerous wins over the competition. In the quarter, we successfully competed against an all-flash competitor with C-Series to win a $16 million deal at an Infrastructure-as-a-Service company. The customer was looking for new storage to host a broad variety of critical applications. Our ease of management for large storage environments, unique data resilience, common toolkit across all our storage systems and the right price performance ratio secured our win despite the competitor's attempt to use price once they realize their value proposition was insufficient. ONTAP One, our all-in-one software license that gives customers access to the industry's most comprehensive data management suite has laid the groundwork to future tech refresh and expansion opportunities. Building on the success of the C-Series, we introduced blocked optimized and AI-ready visions. The ASA C-Series family is a solution tailored to deliver high-performance and guaranteed high availability storage for critical applications, databases and VMware infrastructure, coupled with capacity flash to make enterprise-grade block storage more affordable and sustainable than ever. We added the AFF C-Series to the ONTAP AI architecture, lowering the overall cost of entry to scalable AI without sacrificing performance. Keystone, our Storage as a Service offering is also growing rapidly. In Q2, we added performance and availability guarantees to Keystone, expanding on the existing sustainability and storage efficiency guarantees, creating a comprehensive program to keep storage operations running optimally. We also announced NetApp storage on Equinix Metal, powered by Keystone, providing customers with a single subscription to a full stack of compute, networking and storage infrastructure with low-latency interconnection to all major public clouds. Turning to Public Cloud. As we said last quarter, our priority is growing first party cloud storage services. We aligned our cloud sales specialists to our hyperscaler partners\u2019 go-to-market structures at the start of the fiscal year and are seeing new customer additions and growth in those services. However, that growth has been masked by weakness in subscription services, which have declined to 23% of Public Cloud ARR. During the quarter, we engaged in a strategic review to sharpen the focus of our cloud portfolio. As a result, we will continue to prioritize cloud storage offerings delivered through the hyperscalers, while refocusing some services, such as Cloud Insights and Instaclustr, to complement and extend our hybrid cloud storage offerings, creating greater differentiation and additional value for customers. We will integrate other services that are sold as standalone subscriptions today, such as data protection, into the core functionality of Cloud Volumes. We will also carefully manage the transition of cloud storage subscription services to align to customer preference for consumption offerings. And, we have decided to exit the SaaS backup and virtual desktop services. We anticipate ARR headwinds of approximately $55 million from exited services and unrenewed subscriptions in the second half of fiscal year '24. Growth in first party and marketplace services are expected to partially offset this decline, positioning us to enter FY '25 with a more focused and much healthier business from which to grow. Now to the results of the quarter. Public Cloud segment revenue in Q2 was $154 million, flat from Q1 and up 8% year-over-year. Our first party and marketplace offerings are highly differentiated and are tightly aligned with customers\u2019 buying preferences. These services grew over 30% from Q2 a year ago. We continue to see customer expansion and deepening partnerships, as well as increases in customer count, capacity, revenue and ARR in this part of the portfolio. In Q2, we extended our partnership with Google with the introduction of Google Cloud NetApp Volumes. Now, we are not only the only vendor to have a natively integrated storage service in the public cloud, but we are natively integrated into all three of the leading hyperscale vendors. And we are not standing still with this advantage. Just two months after introducing the GCNV service, we announced the availability of a new lower-cost tier of Google Cloud NetApp Volumes, expanding the offering to address a greater range of workloads. These partnerships uniquely position and enable us to participate in the innovation and adoption of AI services in the public cloud. As examples, during Q2, we announced support for Google Cloud\u2019s Vertex AI with Google Cloud NetApp Volumes, as well as cross-protocol, hybrid cloud AI pipelines on Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP with support for SageMaker Studio notebooks. Our position with the hyperscalers also enables us to displace legacy on-premises competitors as customers migrate workloads to the cloud. A U.S.-based medical equipment company chose FSx for NetApp ONTAP to replace a competitor\u2019s SAN systems when they moved their database workloads to the cloud. This is the customer\u2019s first engagement with NetApp. Following a successful initial deployment, they are evaluating FSxN for workload consolidation and disaster recovery. Looking forward, our focus is clear and is delivering results. We expect the momentum we saw in Q2 to continue through FY '24, despite continued softness in the demand environment due to the challenging macro. Customers value our modern approach to hybrid, multi-cloud infrastructure, and data management which enables IT organizations to leverage data across their entire estate simply, securely, and sustainably. With recent innovations that enable us to address a broader set of markets more efficiently, I am confident that we are well positioned to deliver positive outcomes for customers and stockholders. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mike. Mike Berry : Thank you, George and good afternoon, everyone. Q2 was a very solid quarter in what continues to be a challenging macro environment with soft IT spend. Our relentless focus and consistent execution delivered results that met and exceeded our guidance ranges and drove record-setting non-GAAP profitability measures across consolidated gross margin, product gross margin, operating margin, and EPS. Before I get into the financial details, let me walk you through the key themes for the quarter. As a reminder, all numbers discussed are non-GAAP unless otherwise noted. Our modern, innovative solutions are resonating with customers and our disciplined operational management drove profitability margins to a record high. As we look ahead, we expect our industry leading solutions and unwavering focus to drive revenue growth and profitability in the second half of the fiscal year. Q2 consolidated gross margins of 72% were at an all-time high, driven by product gross margin of 61%, also at an all-time high. Gross margin leverage and the returns on our strategic investments drove record operating margins of 27% and record EPS of $1.58. During the quarter, we returned approximately $403 million to stockholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, reducing share count by 4% versus Q2 '23. Over the course of the year, we expect to return at least 100% of free cash flow to stockholders. Given our growth, profitability and working capital improvements, we expect operating cash flow for the full year to normalize and track relatively in-line with net income for the full year. Due to our solid execution and operational efficiencies, we outperformed the second quarter and expect our continued focus and discipline to deliver year-over-year revenue growth in the second half of the year. As a result, we are raising all our guidance measures for fiscal year '24. Now, to the details of the quarter. Q2 billings of $1.5 billion decreased 9% year-over-year, and revenue of $1.6 billion decreased 6% year-over-year, as IT budgets remain constrained in a challenging macro environment. Adjusting for the FX tailwind of 160-basis-points, billings and revenue would have decreased 11% and 8% year-over-year, respectively. Hybrid Cloud revenue of $1.4 billion decreased 7% year-over-year, and product revenue of $706 million decreased 16% year-over-year. As discussed last quarter, the first half of fiscal year '23 revenue, and most notably product revenue, benefited from elevated levels of backlog entering fiscal year '23. For the second half of fiscal year '24 year-over-year comparisons should be more apples-to-apples. Support revenue, an attach to our install base and indicative of the value of our products, grew 3% year-over-year to $623 million. We are pleased with the momentum of our product portfolio and our go-to-market initiatives implemented at the start of fiscal year '24. Public Cloud revenue increased 8% year-over-year to $154 million and was relatively flat from Q1 '24. As George noted, year-over-year growth was driven by hyperscaler first party and marketplace services, partially offset by continued declines in subscription services. Now, for our operating results. Q2 consolidated gross margin increased 580 basis points year-over-year to 72% and product gross margin increased 1,080 basis points year-over-year to 61%. Product gross margin benefited from three main factors : Number one, a mix shift to higher margin and higher capacity products. Number two, favorable COGs stemming from lower component costs and our strategic purchase agreements for NAND. Number three, price discipline in a cost sensitive, competitive pricing environment. I want to be very clear on this point : there were no unusual or one-time transactions that drove the higher product gross margin results. As we discussed in prior calls, we continue to make strategic purchase commitments to lock-in NAND pricing and mitigate margin pressure from rising prices in the future, as NAND prices largely bottomed out in Q2. Operating expenses of $706 million were flat year-over-year and grew $3 million quarter-over-quarter. Within a relatively consistent OpEx envelope, we will continue to reallocate investments to areas of higher opportunity to drive long-term growth. In Q2 operating margin increased 320 basis points year-over-year to 27%, which includes 80 basis points of FX tailwind. EPS grew 7% year-over-year to $1.58, which includes a $0.07 FX tailwind. These record results demonstrate the strength of our business model, product relevance and unwavering focus and execution. As expected, Q2 operating cash flow of $135 million was impacted by seasonally lower collections and repatriation tax payments. DSO was 46 and inventory turns were 15. More importantly, year-to-date operating cash flow of $588 million grew 19% year-over-year compared to a decline of 8% the same period a year ago. Free cash flow came in at $97 million, bringing the year-to-date amount to $515 million, up 46% year-over-year. During the quarter, we returned $403 million to stockholders through share repurchases and cash dividends, ending the quarter with approximately $230 million in net cash. Our balance sheet remains healthy. Total deferred revenue as of the end of Q2 was $4 billion. The slight decline year-over-year is driven by lower multi-year support and public cloud subscription billings. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.6 billion in cash and short-term investments. Now turning to guidance. Given the success of our product portfolio and consistent execution on operational improvements, we are raising our fiscal '24 guidance in still a soft IT spending environment. We now expect fiscal year '24 revenue to be down approximately 2% year-over-year, an improvement from our previous guidance. We expect to see continued strength in product and hyper-scaler first-party and marketplace services, as we work through minor headwinds from public cloud subscription services. Consolidated gross margins are expected to be approximately 71%. For the second half, we expect product gross margin to range between 58% to 60%, driven by continued mix shift to all-flash products and taking into account the current pricing environment and our commitment to maintain pricing flexibility. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 26% and EPS to be in the range of $6.05 to $6.25 with the assumption of net interest income of approximately $30 million and share count of 212 million. Operating cash flow is expected to move in-line with net income, although there will be some quarterly variance based on working capital. In Q3, we expect revenue to range between $1.51 billion and $1.67 billion, which at the midpoint implies an increase of 4% year-over-year. We expect Q3 consolidated gross margins to be roughly 71%, and operating margin to be approximately 28%. EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.64 to $1.74. In closing, I want to thank our customers, employees and investors once again for their steadfast commitment and investment in NetApp. I remain confident in our ability to manage the elements in our control and focus our key priorities to help customers successfully achieve their digital and cloud journeys. Our portfolio is well aligned to priority IT investments, and we are committed to delivering sustainable, long-term value for our stockholders. I'll now turn the call over to Kris to open the Q&A. Kris? Kris Newton : Thanks, Mike. Operator, we'll begin the Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead. Mehdi Hosseini : Thanks for taking my question. Two quick follow-up. Given the updated fiscal year '24 revenue guide, should we assume that the July product revenue of $590 million was essentially the bottom and you would continue to see a sequential improvement in the second half? And the second question has to do with and momentum with some of these higher margin, higher capacity to product. To what extent should we assume these market share has enabled you to ride out a tough IT spend environment? George Kurian : I'll take the second one, and then Mike can take the first, maybe. We feel very good about the momentum with our C-Series portfolio, we are able to serve customer workloads and use cases, particularly at time of soft IT spending where we are aligned to the value that we bring. And the software value of ONTAP is particularly useful in these all-flash configurations. We are also expanding the total addressable market with the all SAN Array configuration of the C-Series and of the high-performance flash products. So I'm excited about what the future holds for our flash business, and it is because of that momentum and the focus of our go-to-market that we've taken up our guide for the full year. Mike Berry : Thank you, George. Good afternoon, Mehdi. On your question on product revenue, certainly for fiscal '24 implied in the guidance is continued growth in \u2013 or growth in the second half for the product line. Total revenue growth averages about 4% for the second half. We have not guided for fiscal '25 yet, but we certainly would -- we feel good about going into '25 as it relates to our product portfolio and our operational improvements. Mehdi Hosseini : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thanks Mehdi. Next question. Operator : Thank you. Yes, ma'am. And our next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. A couple of questions. Just one, realizing that you're saying there's no major contributor to the gross margin upside. But just how do you see NAND prices increasing, just an outlook on how you see gross margins developing throughout the year and whether these are sustainable? And then just as a second question, do you attribute the more confident in the year to the early success that you're having with C-Series? Do you attribute it to signs you're seeing coming out of INSIGHT? Just what gives you more confidence on the year just given the dampened environment? Thanks. Mike Berry : Hi, Meta. This is Mike. I'll take the first one, and then George will take the second one. So the comment in the script was specifically related to no one-time transactions that drove the overachievement product margins. As we look forward through the rest of fiscal '24 and '25. And let's start with the second half of '24, we're currently guiding product gross margins between 58% and 60%. As we all know, we continue to benefit from the lowest component costs we've seen in many years. We have included some room in our guidance to be flexible in pricing as well as mix and capacity. And as we've all seen from the industry analyst reports, we do expect that component pricing has bottomed out in our Q2 and will rise as we go throughout the rest of '24. We do feel very good about our position for the rest of the fiscal year as it relates to purchase agreements that we have struck as well as prebuy. Similar to '24, we are looking to extend that into '25, and we'll continue to work with our suppliers as we go through the rest of the year. I'd also note that, hey, historically, we all know storage industry pricing evolves as component pricing changes, and we expect that trend to continue. So, all that being said, we feel good about the second half of '24, as we've included in our outlook. As we head into '25, we'll see how things progress as it relates to mix, pricing and component costs and will guide '25 when we get to our Q4 call. With that, I'll hand it to George. George Kurian : With regard to your question on the underlying factors that support our optimism in the guide. First of all, from a macro perspective, it's still a challenged macro with the soft demand environment. We saw incremental improvement in North America, but equally a deceleration in certain parts of Europe, mirroring the economic landscape in the public domain. I think within the large enterprise, we see a case-by-case situation in terms of demand and we continue to see a more robust product business in this commercial or mid-market customer base. So, no real fundamental change in the demand environment. With regard to the two underlying factors for confidence. One is, we are a much more focused go-to-market organization, and we are seeing the second consecutive quarter of pipeline and performance from the changes we made at the start of the fiscal year. And so I want to credit our go-to-market teams for their focus and the results that they have delivered this quarter, and that is one of the key contributors. The second is the really strong performance of our all-flash portfolio. We talked in the prepared remarks about a large competitive win against a purely flash competitor. And we see that across multiple segments where we are seeing competitive wins with our portfolio. So those are the two fundamental reasons : go-to-market focus and execution and confidence in our portfolio. Meta Marshall : Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question today comes from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Krish Sankar : Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Actually I have two questions for George. George, first one, kind of like what are the lead times for the storage products today? And what does that imply for your visibility when you look into calendar '24? And the second question is, curious whether on a storage content per customer, does it \u2013 have you seen any increase in it because of AI? Or do you think that will happen maybe at some point in the future? Or is there any way to put some time lines around it? George Kurian : With regard to lead times, we are at normal lead times for our portfolio, and we reached those normal lead times a few quarters ago. With regard to the question on storage demand for AI, listen, I think we have been in the AI business for predictive AI or industrial AI for five years. And there are large data sets that are built out to support training of those models and the implementation of those models across the enterprise. So we have a good and robust business there. We are starting to see early signs of trials and use cases with generative AI. Generative AI is particularly well suited for NetApp's capabilities because it operates on unstructured data, files, documents, video, audio and so on. And so we have large repositories of those and customers, and we are able to use that data set and add to that data set to support AI use cases. This quarter, we won a large AI implementation at a very large U.S. bank that was really focused on generative AI document summarization analysis and so on, and we are the infrastructure foundation for that. So it will take time for generative AI to become a demand driver. We are seeing early positive signs there. Krish Sankar : Thanks, George. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Please go ahead. Steven Fox : Hi. Good afternoon. I had two questions on the product business. So first of all, I'm not fully understanding what you're saying about the pricing environment. At one point you said, you maintained disciplined pricing and then at another point you would be flexible going forward with pricing. So can you sort of give us a sense for how challenging or not challenging it is to hold pricing in these gross margins? And the second one is related to the product gross margins. I'm just still trying to get a sense for how sustainable this last quarter and the guidance for the next quarter is in terms of product gross margins, even if we adjust for the changes in NAND pricing? Thanks. George Kurian : Listen, on pricing, we've been in this industry for a very long period of time. And while there will be people who are vendors who are aggressive in any particular transaction or other, depending on their own strategic reasons. Overall, we don't see fundamental changes in the pricing environment. Clearly, the room with lower component costs gives you an opportunity to do more in terms of pricing flexibility. But I think that our past quarter's gross margin results our demonstration of the fact that we've been able to maintain pricing discipline at a time where demand is soft, and it talks to both the differentiation of our product portfolio and the execution in our field teams. I'll have Mike talk a bit about your second question. Mike Berry : Thanks, George. And I'll refer to George's comments, Steve, when I talk about the sustainability. So as -- so we finished at 61% product margins in Q2. We guided a range of 50% to 60% in the back half. We feel very good about our component costs and the view of that for the rest of our fiscal '24. The reason why we guided slightly lower than Q2 from a margin perspective, that's exactly what George talked about, which is we feel really good about our pricing discipline in our products but we want to make sure and leave room to be flexible should we need that in the second half. That's the one part of the equation that we don't control as much as the cost. So hopefully, that helps. We would not have guided that range if we didn't feel good about it for the second half, Steve. Steven Fox : Yes. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Asiya Merchant with Citi. Please go ahead. Asiya Merchant : Great. Thank you. Maybe just a little bit on the macro. Clearly, you're executing really well. And should we -- should we expect slightly better than seasonal growth for you guys in the second half, just given the fact that you guys are ramping on a new product? And then just broadly on the macro, are we starting to see more adoption of flash across the customer base in general as people start to appreciate maybe more pricing being more attractive or is this something that was specific to NetApp just given the success that you're seeing in your C-Series? Thank you. George Kurian : I'll take the second, and Michael cover the first question. Thank you for the question. Listen, I think that with regard to customer adoption of flash-based technologies, they are -- we saw the high-performance landscape moved to flash several years ago, and there's been a steady movement of that footprint to flash. That is about 15% to 20% of the overall storage market, maybe 20%. The next tranche of use cases are more in the general purpose application footprint. These are in the process of migrating over multiple years. We are in the early innings of that migration. And so we feel very good about the position of our flash portfolio to attack that part of the market. It is essentially the 10K hard drive market that is about 30% to 40% of the hard drive market. So, you'll see that move over time. And so I'll let Mike talk to the first question you had. Mike Berry : Sure. On your question, Asiya, as it relates to linearity, we did see a nice quarter-on-quarter pickup in Q2 which was really driven by the factors that George discussed. And look at the midpoint of guidance for the year, we do expect it to be relatively consistent with the numbers we like to talk about, which is the 48% in the first half and 52% in the second. Again, keep in mind that the good bit of our revenue, thankfully comes from support, very predictable. Hopefully, we can do a little better, but that is -- the midpoint of guidance is pretty much right on linearity. Asiya Merchant : Great. Thank you. Mike Berry : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Yes, thank you so much. I was wondering, George, if you could comment a little bit on a public cloud revenue trajectory in fiscal '24, given some of the changes that you noted? And given those changes in CloudOps, how does that change your long-term revenue outlook for that business on a relative basis, I think before you were thinking 40% of total Public Cloud. Wondering where you're thinking that, that might shake out now in the long-term? George Kurian : So, let me provide some baseline before I jump into the strategy review takeaways and the implications. First, cloud is roughly 10% of total revenue. Subscription is 23% of cloud revenue, down from about 35% a year ago. So, it's a small percentage of the total cloud revenue and an even smaller percentage of the total company revenue. The mix of Cloud Storage and CloudOps is still relatively consistent approximately 60/40. We focused our strategy review on all elements of our cloud portfolio and had five key takeaways that I outlined in my prepared comments. Sharpening the focus on first-party and hyperscaler marketplace storage services. These performed very well in the second quarter and continue to be uniquely differentiated both to end customers of our on-premises solution and a vehicle to acquire net new customers alongside our cloud partners. We would carefully manage the transition of some of the storage subscriptions to our consumption offering as we roll out [1P] services, customers that used to buy storage subscriptions prefer to now go towards the 1P offering, and we'll manage that carefully. We will integrate some standalone services like data protection and privacy into our cloud storage offerings so that they bring more value to the base offering. And we'll refocus other services like Cloud Insights, which are subscription services and Instaclustr to differentiate NetApp in the cloud storage workload motions that we are focused on. We've decided to exit some standalone services like Virtual Desktop and SaaS Backup services. And all of this will lead to about a $55 million ARR headwind from these actions in the second half of fiscal year '24. The reduction in Public Cloud subscription services will be partially offset by the good growth of our consumption cloud storage services in particular. And so our plans for the second half of the year assumes that we will have a modest decline in cloud revenue. We're not going to guide it but we assume that. And we have built that into the guidance for the fiscal year '24, which we took up by approximately $100 million. We're not going to comment today on the outlook for the overall cloud business. We will talk to you when we update our long-term models to that effect. Wamsi Mohan : Okay. Thanks, George. And if I could, Mike, your margins were really, really strong, both sequentially and on an absolute basis. Wondering as we think about free cash flow margins, would all this EBIT margin improvement flow through into free cash flow margins? And secondarily, just on the EBIT margins, is there a way to dimension out of the three things that you noted, maybe rank order or order of magnitude so that we can get some sense around the confidence of sustainability, especially as it relates to commodity pricing, which you seem to indicate won't really matter too much sequentially. But just wondering what was the biggest sequential driver of that margin improvement? Thank you. Mike Berry : Sure. So on two questions there. First of all, on cash flow, and I'll do operating cash flow. We do expect for the year, I talked about it in the prepared remarks, operating cash flow to move relatively consistently with non-GAAP net income. So to your question, yes, as the income increases associated operating cash flow, short of any quarterly fluctuations in working capital. So all good there in terms of free cash flow margins largely moving with operating cash flow. And then on the second question, and I'll answer this on a sequential basis, not a year-over-year basis. As we look from Q1 to Q2, certainly, the mix shift was a significant impact. We did receive some benefit on costs as those older inventories are now completely gone. And then, of course, pricing discipline is in there as well. So I would rank from a sequential perspective, the order that I did in my prepared remarks in terms of mix shift, which is both product and capacity than favorable COGS and then pricing discipline. So hopefully, that helps. Wamsi Mohan : Yes, thanks. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Nehal Chokshi : Great. Thanks for taking my question. You guys mentioned 30% growth in first-party storage services. What's the NRR underlying that? George Kurian : We don't break those out. I think we feel very good about -- we have brought in the number of workloads that we serve. We have brought in the number of hyperscalers now with Google coming online. We have brought lower price points for Azure and Google, and we have brought higher price points for Amazon. So I feel really, really good about the momentum in our first-party cloud storage services. Nehal Chokshi : Maybe phrasing it in a different way, the driver of that growth is expansion or lands? George Kurian : The combination of both new customer adds and add new workload use cases within existing customers as well as expansions. Nehal Chokshi : Great. And then a follow-up, quick question. George, you talked about how you had a $16 million win with the C-Series. And you mentioned four drivers behind that. Much of those four drivers was really probably the biggest element of that win? George Kurian : Listen, I think we have a really strong operating system capability for performance and simplification at scale. Many of the other vendors that start simple run into real trouble when you try to build a large enterprise environment. And we have a really good portfolio to do that. I think that was probably the number one reason. And the number two reason is now that we have the C-Series, we have a price point to deliver to customers who used to not have it. Nehal Chokshi : Awesome. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Simon Leopold : Great. Thanks for taking the question. First, just a quick clarification. On the strategic review update, I just want to confirm, it sounds like you've concluded that review apart from sort of regular business kind of reviews. I just want to confirm that, that's the case. And then really, the element I'm trying to sort of tease out here is you've taken out $55 million of ARR, so roughly $15 million of revenue, yet your outlook is higher. What is informing the higher outlook? What's been the biggest surprise and the biggest delta contributing to the higher outlook? Thank you. George Kurian : So first of all, let me hit that in three parts, right? First, we have concluded the strategic review. We have a set of good decisions we've made that we need to now go implement that will result in a more focused cloud business and a healthier subscription base, albeit a smaller one that build off. We believe that these actions should allow us to get back to growth in fiscal year '25 of a healthier business mix in cloud. We always will do reviews of various aspects of our portfolio as ongoing parts of our business. But the focused strategic review, I would say, is mostly complete. I think the second is with regard to the confidence we have. Listen, we said that when we guided the second half of the year, we took up the overall guide by close to $100 million. That is mostly based on the momentum of our all-flash Hybrid Cloud storage portfolio. We've raised the second half guide by substantially more than we beat in the second quarter. And it also accounts for the fact that we will have some headwinds through the rest of fiscal year '24 in our cloud subscription business, which will only be partially offset by growth in our cloud consumption business. Simon Leopold : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question then comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Thanks for taking the question. A lot of those have been asked and answered. But I wanted to go back to some prior discussion around this notion of AI. And we hear a lot about like AI, large language models becoming smaller and implemented more maybe pervasively over time in traditional enterprise environments. We've even heard more about inferencing and how that might evolve in enterprises. I'm just curious, are you seeing at all any signs of that pulling either discussions or early signs of demand? And if so, is it a prerequisite that, that has to pull as all-flash storage with that kind of footprint. And the reason I ask is there's a lot of discussion about a lot of this existing infrastructure that's going to have to be upgraded to support these acceleration of AI in infrastructure? Sorry for the long-winded question. George Kurian : Yes. No problem. I'll address that in three steps. I think first is the use of smaller models as opposed to the very, very large model. Yes, that term is distillation. We do see that going on in customers, whereas they kind of run these different models, they begin to realize that you can get as effective an outcome with much faster results and a smaller number of parameters. For example, the demonstration, the live demonstration that we showed at NetApp INSIGHT actually was the distillation. We started with a much larger LLM and we brought it to a much smaller range of parameters because you get the same benefit. So that's going on. The second is with regard to training environment, which is the part of the data life cycle in AI where you aggregate a data set and you train the algorithm or the language model for better answers to be able to either predict a good outcome or generate a relevant outcome. You do need very high-performance storage because the GPUs that drive those algorithms need very, very fast parallel access to data. And with our unstructured data scale-out file system, we feel very well positioned for that. And then the third is with regard to inferencing, inferencing is the part of the data life cycle where you've taken a model and now you want to put it into production on our data set could be on a factory floor, could be in a distributed office. There it really depends on the data set and the use case what type of storage you need. You may need it for larger environments like shop floors, but you may not need super high-performance storage and compute for a very small office, like a claim\u2019s office, for example, in insurance. Aaron Rakers : That's very helpful. And as a quick follow-up, real quickly, who is your predominant competitor that you see on the block optimized C-level all-flash arrays or C-Series arrays? George Kurian : It's all -- the block market is a crowded market. We feel very good about our offerings in the mid-range, especially and the ability to offer a single solution with common automation, common administration, common life cycle management for both fire and block. And no other vendor in the market can do that. And so we feel very good. I think the large competitors are clearly Dell and HPE are in the mid-range and then you occasionally see some pure. Aaron Rakers : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I guess if I start with the Public Cloud strategic review that you discussed, just wanted to clarify, based on the changes you're making there, are there any cost implications other changes? I'm assuming that allows you to focus your go-to-market a bit more, but is there any sort of cost implication where you're enabling some cost take out there? And secondly, Mike, you mentioned sort of the 58% to 60% gross margin on the product revenue in the second half. When we think about, sort of, prebuys that you might do going into fiscal '25, how should we think about the trajectory of the gross margin into fiscal '25. Any levers that you have to offset sort of the flow-through of that to the operating margin that you're really reporting at a very strong level right now? Thank you. George Kurian : On the cost side, listen, I think we will, for the most part, just repurpose those resources to drive growth in our first-party cloud storage, we feel good about the demand environment there, and we want to continue to accelerate that. Whatever cost opportunities they are, it's been factored into the second half guidance that we gave you. Mike Berry : Okay. And then thanks for the question, Samik. On the question, especially going into fiscal '25 from the product margin, I'll go over a little bit my answer to Meta when he asked the same question. So as we've all seen from the analyst reports, we have -- we do expect that NAND is largely bottomed. We're at the loss component pricing we've been at in a while. We did a really nice job and kudos to the supply chain team for doing the prebuys and purchase agreements for '24. We will certainly look at those and continue to look at those in '25, but it has to make sense for both NetApp and our suppliers. So as we go into '21, there are certainly some levers. The big question there, Samik that I don't have an answer to is what does the market do and pricing do over the next six months. That's why we're going to wait, will guide the margin number when we guide for the full year because we really want to get through the next couple of quarters to see how component pricing goes, what we expect the mix to be. And then what happens from a pricing environment perspective. Samik Chatterjee : Okay. Thank you. George Kurian : On the cost side, listen, I think we will, for the most part, just repurpose those resources Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead. Ananda Baruah : Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, George, an inference related question, maybe two quick parts. Are you hearing any of your customers talk about legislation around inferencing, having an impact on their plans? And I guess, just generally speaking, any opinion you have on sort of what that ramp over what time period kind of looks like even. If just anecdotally would be helpful. I appreciate it. Thanks. George Kurian : Yes. I think, first of all, we are in the stages of generated AI. Predictive AI is quite mature and has very strong use cases. We have done really well in health care and life sciences in manufacturing, in parts of financial services, lots of use cases, right? And so I think that's mature. It requires good data sets and good data management to make it have the right outcome. With Generative AI, there is obviously a lot of discussion on both regulation as well as judicious use of the technology, everything from fairness to epic to privacy to all kind cybersecurity, all of those things. And I think it will take time. Where we are with most clients today is proof of concepts, right? They are trying to put their data sets together, they are trying to learn what these models, will help them do. And there are some use cases which are really easy to see the benefits from software development. It's very easy to see the benefits from, the more advanced ones where some of these concerns exist. They basically customers move cautiously. So it will take time. These are multiyear use case developments. And so we feel good about where we are at the moment, and we're just realistic that will lead time to build momentum. Ananda Baruah : Yes. Thanks for the context. That\u2019s helpful. Operator : Thank you. And our final question today comes from Sidney Ho with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Sidney Ho : Great. Apologize if you have already addressed this. On the macro level, are you seeing any major differences between demand from large enterprises, small leading businesses in federal. Any particular verticals you would point out that shows particular strength of weakness both on the Hybrid Cloud and the Public Cloud? Thanks George Kurian : The demand picture is still soft and mixed. Overall, we saw some improvements in the U.S., offset by some weakness in Europe. Nothing is not in the public domain. With regard to the customer time, large enterprise is still soft. Tech, for example, tech and service provider spending has not really come back. It is really a customer-by-customer situation versus a broad industry situation. With regard to the demand picture in midsized enterprise, our mid-sized enterprise business performed more robustly and secularly better than our large enterprise business. Public sector continues to be a work in progress. We saw some of the impact of the budget negotiations result in softer budgets for certain agencies. Our business performed well, particularly in the civilian agencies. Sidney Ho : Great. Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you, Sidney. I'm going to hand it back to George for some final comments. George Kurian : In closing, I want to thank the entire NetApp team for their strong execution and operational discipline in Q2, which drove revenue above the midpoint of our guidance and record gross margin, operating margin and EPS. Only NetApp delivers an entire architecture of unified data storage solutions, helping customers operate with seamless flexibility to deploy new applications, unifying their data for AI and simplify data protection in a world of limited IT sources, rapid data growth and increased cybersecurity threats. Innovation in our all-flash storage portfolio enables us to address a broader TAM and we continue to innovate and lead in Public Cloud storage services. Our go-to-market team is laser- focused on these positions of strength, enabling us to deliver strong results in the challenged macro landscape. Looking ahead, I'm confident that the momentum we saw in Q2 will continue through the remainder of fiscal year '24. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines, and have a wonderful day.",

Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to George. George Kurian : Thanks, Kris. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our Q3 FY 2024 call. I'm pleased to report, that we delivered exceptional performance across the board, despite an uncertain macro environment. Revenue was above the midpoint of our guidance, driven by the momentum of our expanded all-flash product portfolio. This strength coupled with continued operational discipline yielded company all-time highs for consolidated gross margin, operating margin, and EPS for the second consecutive quarter. Entering FY 2024, we laid out a plan to drive better performance in our Storage business and build a more focused approach to our Public Cloud business, while managing the elements within our control in an uncertain macroeconomy to further improve our profitability. These actions have delivered strong results to-date, support our raised outlook for the year. And enhance our position for the long-term. Only NetApp delivers a comprehensive architecture based on a single operating system, that supports any application or data type, spans on-premises and multiple cloud environments, and is available in traditional CapEx or as-a-service procurement models. Our unified data solutions, address some of the biggest priorities IT organizations face today, modernizing legacy infrastructure, improving resiliency against ransomware attacks, and building scalable, high performance data pipelines for AI workloads. The consistent operations, common management tools, integrated data services, and unique and proven capabilities for Hybrid Cloud of our unified storage architecture, provides customers the ability to simplify at scale and lower storage costs. Our silo-free approach to unified data storage is clearly resonating with customers, driving healthy demand for our products and services, and positioning us well to deliver long-term growth. Turning to the results of the quarter, we delivered robust year-over-year performance in our Hybrid Cloud segment with revenue growth of 6% and product revenue growth of 10%, driven by momentum from our newly introduced all-flash products and the go-to-market changes we made at the start of the year. Strong customer demand for our industry leading all-flash solutions drove all-flash growth of 21% year-over-year, to an all-time high annualized revenue run rate of $3.4 billion. In Q3, our all-flash business expanded to approximately 60% of Hybrid Cloud segment revenue. As Mike will detail, we expect a sustainable step-up in our baseline product gross margin going forward with the continued revenue shift to all-flash. The AFF C-Series all-flash arrays again exceeded our expectations, delivering new-to-NetApp customers and numerous wins over the competition. As customers modernize Legacy 10k Hard Disk Drives and Hybrid Flash environments, we are displacing competitors' installed bases with our All-Flash Solutions, driving share gains. Our newly introduced ASA families, of SAN-optimized, high-performance and capacity-oriented all-flash arrays also outperformed our expectations. We're excited about the enormous potential in the nearly $20 billion SAN market. Our modern all-flash SAN arrays, backed by industry-leading data availability and efficiency guarantees, are well-positioned to redefine the competitive landscape. In Q3, we had numerous competitive take-outs across a broad set of workloads and vertical markets as customers leveraged our C-Series and ASA products to modernize their legacy infrastructures and deploy new applications like Artificial Intelligence. We continue to see strong interest in our advanced portfolio of Ransomware Protection Solutions. We help customers, take proactive steps to protect, detect, and recover their data. Competitive Solutions focus only on data recovery, but NetApp keeps data protected and secured from the start with products designed to block cybersecurity risks and mitigate the high cost of downtime. ONTAP is the first Enterprise-Class Storage Solution validated by the NSA for the Commercial Solutions for Classified Program, demonstrating the strength of our state-of-the-art, data protection and cybersecurity solutions. We saw good momentum in AI, with dozens of customer wins in the quarter, including several large NVIDIA SuperPOD and BasePOD deployments. We help organizations in use cases that range from unifying their data in modern data lakes to deploying large model training environments, and to operationalize those models into production environments. To best take advantage of Generative AI capabilities, customers are looking to augment foundational models with their own data. Our high-performance, scalable unified data storage systems create intelligent data pipelines that allow customers to capture, aggregate and prepare their data for AI. NetApp delivers the data management capabilities for security, performance, and simplicity that enterprises require for their GenAI workflows. We continue to advance our position with the development of GenAI driven cloud and on-premises solutions in partnership with industry leaders. Demand for consumption options is also growing as some customers look to increase budget flexibility in an ongoing uncertain macro and higher interest rate environment. However, this is not a universal mandate. Our unified data storage solutions are available as CapEx, as-a-service, and cloud native offerings, providing customers with the widest range of buying options, enabling them to meet their budget requirements. Keystone, our Storage-as-a-Service offering, delivered another strong quarter, with revenue growing triple-digits from Q3 a year ago. Keystone is a great solution for customers who want a cloud-like operating model on premises. For customers who are ready to move to the cloud, we uniquely partner with the leading hyperscalers to deliver cloud-native storage services. Public Cloud segment revenue was $151 million, up 1% year-over-year. First party and hyperscaler marketplace storage services remain our priority and are growing rapidly, with the ARR of these services up more than 35% year-over-year. These offerings are highly differentiated and tightly aligned to customer buying preference. We continue to deepen our hyperscaler partnerships, and deliver growth in customer count, capacity, revenue and ARR with this part of the portfolio. As I outlined last quarter, we are taking action to sharpen our approach to our Public Cloud business. As a part of this plan, we exited two small services in the quarter. We also began the work of refocusing Cloud Insights and InstaClustr to complement and extend our hybrid cloud storage offerings and integrating some standalone services into the core functionality of Cloud Volumes to widen our competitive moat. In Q4, we anticipate approximately $20 million in ARR headwinds from unrenewed subscriptions. This will create minimal revenue impact and should be largely offset by growth in first-party and marketplace services. We will continue refining our focus in fiscal year 2025, building a stronger base from which to grow. Our hyperscaler partnerships and natively integrated storage services, position us to address the new and emerging GenAI opportunity in the cloud. A leading open-source developer of GenAI tools, datasets and models is leveraging AWS\u2019 FSx for NetApp ONTAP as a part of its offerings. The customer was looking for a high-performance and resilient file storage solution to train extensive AI/ML workloads. FSxN gave them a scalable solution with performant storage for intensive AI model training. As a fully managed service, FSxN removes operational burdens, allowing their DevOps teams to focus on business value activities. In summary, we entered the final quarter of fiscal year '24 in a much stronger position than we were at the start of the year despite the ongoing macro uncertainty, our modern approach to unified data storage, which spans data types, price points and hybrid multi-cloud environments is resonating in the market. We are successfully executing against our top priorities, growing in all flash and cloud storage services. We are well positioned with an expanded TAM, including block storage, and new market opportunities like AI to drive continued growth and share gains. We are moving to a higher product margin profile, supported by growth in all-flash products. And we will continue to maintain the operating discipline that has yielded record profitability. I'm very pleased with our momentum and very confident in our ability to deliver positive outcomes for customers and stockholders. Finally, I want to make you aware of our June 11, Investor Day, where we will provide an update on our long-term strategy and business model. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mike. Mike Berry : Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, all numbers I will discuss today are non-GAAP, unless otherwise noted. Our focus and strong execution again delivered record-setting results, reaching all-time highs across key profitability measures, including consolidated gross margin, product gross margin, operating margin, net income and EPS. Before I discuss the financial details, let me walk you through the key themes for the quarter. As George noted, we continue to see positive results from our new all-flash products and the go-to-market changes we implemented at the start of the fiscal year. The momentum from our industry-leading flash portfolio, coupled with our operational discipline, drove both top and bottom line growth in the quarter. Q3 consolidated gross margin of 73% and product gross margin of 63% and were both at all-time highs for the second consecutive quarter. Gross margin leverage and operating discipline drove operating margin of 30% and EPS of $1.94, both also setting company records for the second consecutive quarter. Q3 operating cash flow came in at $484 million, and free cash flow was $448 million. We expect operating cash flow for the full year to be at least $1.3 billion, tracking relatively in line with net income. The strong execution of our priorities of winning in flash and growing first-party cloud services are clearly paying off. Given our strong execution of results that met or beat our guidance ranges, while driving record-setting profitability measures for the second consecutive quarter, we are once again raising our full year revenue and EPS guidance. Looking ahead, we are even more confident in our position to drive long-term revenue growth and profitability. Now, to the details of the quarter. Q3 billings increased 7% year-over-year to $1.7 billion and revenue increased 5% year-over-year to $1.6 billion, driven by momentum in our all-flash array product families. Hybrid cloud revenue increased 6% year-over-year to $1.5 billion and product revenue increased 10% year-over-year to $747 million. Support revenue grew 2% year-over-year to $631 million. We are pleased with the success of moving the responsibility for the majority of our renewals to the customer success team implemented as a part of our go-to-market focus. Public cloud revenue grew 1% year-over-year to $151 million. As expected, growth was driven by our first party and marketplace cloud storage services offset by declines in subscription services. Now for our operating results. Q3 consolidated gross margin was 73%. Gross profit margin dollars increased 14% year-over-year to $1.2 billion driven by strong growth of product gross profit dollars. Q3 product gross margin of 63% was 250 basis points higher than the high-end of our guide, primarily driven by better-than-expected mix shift to all-flash products and pricing discipline in what remains a cost-sensitive environment. Operating expenses of $682 million increased 5% year-over-year and declined slightly from Q2 as expected. As a result of operating leverage and disciplined management, Q3 operating profit dollars increased 30% year-over-year to $485 million and operating margin increased 580 basis points from a year ago to 30%, a record for the second consecutive quarter. EPS grew 42% year-over-year to a record high of $1.94. Our tax rate was 18%, lower than expected due to an adjustment of our full year tax rate. Normalizing for a tax rate of 21.5%, EPS would still have been a record high of $1.86. Q3 operating cash flow of $484 million was up 28% year-over-year, and free cash flow was up 40% year-over-year, driven by solid billings and profitability. DSO was 45% and inventory turns were 14, both consistent with expectations. Year-to-date operating cash flow of $1.1 billion increased 23% year-over-year. During the quarter, we returned $203 million to stockholders through share repurchases and cash dividends, ending the quarter with approximately $526 million in net cash. Year-to-date, we have generated $963 million in free cash flow and returned more than 100% to stockholders. Our balance sheet remains healthy. Total deferred revenue as of the end of Q3 was $4.1 billion, down 2% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with approximately $2.9 billion in cash and short-term investments. Before moving to Q4 and fiscal 2024 guidance, I would like to spend a few minutes discussing our product gross margin expectations going forward. We have seen the price increases on NAND from suppliers, and these increases will impact all industry participants. The mix shift to our higher-margin all-flash products will partially offset the headwinds from these price increases going forward. As a result of our shift to all-flash, we expect product gross margin to expand to the upper 50% to 60% from our historical norm of approximately 55%. Please note, in any given quarter, commodity prices, product mix, and the pricing environment will cause product gross margin to fluctuate from this new baseline. That being said, I want to make sure to reiterate this point : even with the increase in commodity costs we fully expect our product gross margins to expand to the upper 50% to 60% level driven by the shift to our all-flash portfolio. Now let\u2019s turn to guidance. As George noted, we are pleased with the results of our focus and continued operational discipline. Given our better-than-expected results and our improved outlook for Q4, we are again raising our FY 2024 revenue guidance to a range of $6.185 to $6.335 billion, or $6.26 billion at the midpoint. We expect to see continued strength in all-flash products and Hyperscaler First Party and Marketplace Services. FY 2024 consolidated gross margin is expected to be in the range of 71% to 72%. Product gross margin is expected to be approximately 60%, driven by the continued favorable mix shift to all-flash products. Operating margin is expected to be approximately 27% and EPS to be in the range of $6.40 to $6.50, with the assumption of net interest income of approximately $40 million and share count of 212 million. Our full year tax rate is projected to be 20%. We expect operating cash flow for the full year to be at least, $1.3 billion. In Q4, we expect revenue to range between $1.585 billion and $1.735 billion, which at the midpoint of $1.66 billion implies an increase of 5% year-over-year. We expect Q4 consolidated gross margin to be roughly 71%, and product gross margin to be approximately 60%. Operating margin is projected to be in the range of 27% to 28%. Implied in this guidance, we expect operating expenses to increase from Q3 due mainly to higher incentive compensation, the timing of marketing programs and targeted investment to drive key product roadmap items. Our tax rate is expected to be 20% and EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.73 to $1.83. Also please note that our purchase commitments for NAND for FY 2025 demand will impact our cash flow and balance sheet in Q4, which is included in our updated cash flow forecast and will result in inventory turns to be in the eight to 10 times range. In closing, I want to thank our customers, partners, employees and stockholders for their unwavering commitment and investment in NetApp. We continue to prove our ability to manage the elements within our control and our solid top-line results demonstrate the value that customers realized from our products and services. Our innovative portfolio is well aligned to priority IT investments and we remain committed to delivering sustainable long-term value for our stockholders. I'll now turn the call over to Kris to open the Q&A. Kris? Kris Newton : Thanks, Mike. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Meta Marshall : Great. Thank you and congrats on the quarter. I guess, George, you went into a lot of detail just around what you're seeing on the AI side. I guess if you could just get a sense of when you're seeing the timing of maybe people making investments versus -- kind of the various stages of AI? And then maybe just as a follow-up question, just what you're seeing in terms of the competitive environment just in terms of kind of innovative thinking around AI solutions. Thanks. George Kurian : Thank you for your question. I think we're in the early phases of the GenAI opportunity. As you know, we have been in the AI market for a long time and have seen a lot of examples of proven use cases in predictive AI. We are starting to see the early phases of Generative AI. And what I mean by that is customers collecting and unifying their data and starting to augment the foundational models with their own data, so that it is more relevant to their business. We expect that to continue for several months or a year, and we think that the deployment of production models and the movement from training to inferencing, becomes more relevant as we head into next year. With regard to the work that we have seen, we had a really strong quarter in the flash business. And we\u2019ve got several eight-figure deals in Q3, one of the world's largest oil and gas companies build their AI supercomputer NetApp, one of the world's largest genomics company relying on our technology to speed up genomic analysis with NVIDIA and NetApp, one of the world's largest media companies is using us to drive some of the early phases of their Generative AI work. And we also have examples in the public cloud where one of the world's largest open source model providers is using NetApp's cloud technology to enable their customers to access and train their models. So we've got real many different examples of success. I think if you draw out our strength is scale and performance, super part certification, the fact that we can build a hybrid cloud data pipeline and the data management capabilities that we've had for many years that allow you to do things like model versioning, security for your mission-critical data and be able to deploy and connect data pipelines from production back into training. So I feel really good about our strength in the AI market. It's early around GenAI, and we are doing the work to expand our opportunity there. Meta Marshall : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Eddie Pellon : Hey guys, this is Eddie for Chris. Congrats on the great execution here. George, I think many people still underappreciate how file services is an AI beneficiary. For example, if you set up an AWS SageMaker account, developers can have plenty of file services options, including NetApp's FSX, so maybe talk about what differentiates FSX versus other file services, and what kind of customers you attract, what use cases is it used for? And if you can touch on how big ANF and FSX are within public cloud, that would be great. I do have another question, please. George Kurian : First of all, I think that unstructured data is the vast majority of the value in Generative AI. Generative AI really operates on documents and objects and videos and images and a variety of those data sets. And as you know, NetApp has a huge percentage of the enterprises unstructured data stored or systems. We help them in a few different ways. One way that we help them is if their data science team that's building AI training and building some of their models, wants to start in the public cloud, you can very quickly and easily take data from your enterprise environment securely into the public cloud and use it in the public cloud. Second, as you know, we have very high performance scale-out solutions like the one that we referred to on the call, we're one of the world's largest open source model providers is using our high-performance scale-out SSX solutions on Amazon to do model training. And then the third is in the enterprise itself, if the enterprise wants to scale that production environment, we have certifications with NVIDIA, for example, that allows them to quickly build a super part with us, train it and then deploy the trained models into production. So we feel very, very confident about the expanding opportunity in front of us. We've had several good wins and we are investing to expand our opportunity in this space. Eddie Pellon : That's very helpful, George. Thank you. And one for Mike quickly. Can you give a fresh, please our memory about how customer behavior has historically changed when NAND prices increase aggressively in short periods of time? Like do they usually reduce purchases of all flash arrays and go more to hybrids? Or is NAND a small percentage of the bill of materials today, because of a very low pricing, where a 50% increase in NAND prices, for example, will not meaningfully change the system price you guys charge customers. That's it for me. Thank you. Mike Berry : Yes. Eddie, there was a lot of questions in there. What we'd say is a couple of things. Remember, customers' budget based on dollars, and that's the way that they purchased. We haven't seen anything like in the last year in terms of really NAND prices declining as much as they did. More than anything, we think that, that has made SSD flash technology more affordable, all the benefits that you get around environmentals and economics as well as energy now make that a much better economic decision for them. So that's really the change that we've seen. Short-term -- other short-term changes really don't change the market that much because, again, these are long-term decisions companies are making. George Kurian : And just to add to that, SSDs are not 50%. They are less than 50% of our bill of materials or probably anybody else's bill of materials. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Joe Cardoso : Hey. Thanks for the question. This is Joe Cardoso on for Samik. So, first one for me. It seems like you continue to see strong momentum with the C-Series and the other new flash products that you guys have introduced and they even appear to be outperforming your expectation in each quarter. So just curious, if you could talk to how momentum for those products have tracked through 3Q and into 4Q to-date. It doesn't sound like you're seeing any signs of that momentum slowing down, but can you just confirm that. And do you expect that we're still very much in the early innings of these product cycles with your customers? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks. George Kurian : Yes. Maybe I can address that in three ways. I think the C-Series product cycle is to modernize both, traditional hybrid flash systems as well as deploy new private cloud environments, and we are seeing strong advantages there. That's the first use case. And you can see we do not see any end to that. The 10-K drive transition is a multiyear transition. We're in the early stages of that. On the private cloud side, I think some of the changes in licensing that some of the software vendors have, have renewed interest in our technology as a vehicle to give them -- give customers a path to the future. The second opportunity is the ASA product family. NetApp has had a long history in the block storage space, we've had tens of thousands of customers using our technology to serve block workloads, and we are in the early innings of bringing out a package solution that's focused solely on the block market. And we've been pleased with both of those use cases. And then the third area, of course, which is set for rapid expansion and growth is AI. And I feel really, really good with the focus on execution. Every time we've set a set of targets internally, we've been them and we've raised them externally. And so, we got strong momentum. We're going to stay focused and disciplined in our execution going forward. Joe Cardoso : Got it. I appreciate the color there, George. And then just as my second one, it appears the appetite from customers to consume storage more on a consumption basis is increasing based on our checks with the channel as well as comments from you and your peers. I know you touched on the driver being in some part due to this uneven macro that we're seeing. But are you seeing anything else as a driver there, like the maturity around the offerings or go-to-market motion. The reason I'm asking, it just feels like it wasn't too long ago when the opportunity here felt more theoretical and there was not as much appetite coming from the customers. So I would just be interested to hear, like has anything changed on that front? Thank you. George Kurian : I think there's probably two or three things. I think the maturity of the offerings. I think customers comfort around how they would procure cloud-like models. I think the second is the increase in interest rates that on the margin caused certain customers to think about CapEx versus OpEx. And then the third, of course, is the customers that are in transition from one environment to another. For example, when you're in a data center transition and you've got a portion of the life of a data center environment that needs to be continued, moving to an as-a-service model is a good transition point. We have offered as a service for many years. Clearly, the most flexible, the fastest and the easiest to build an elastic environment, is around true public cloud. We also have solutions with colocation providers like Equinix that allows the customer to get a full cloud-like opportunity in a colocation environment, connected to the Public Cloud and our Keystone service in the customers' data centers had another really strong quarter. We are up year-to-date almost more than triple-digits, including this past quarter. So we see strong momentum in that category. And we do not see a mandate for it, but it's a nice new way for us to address a set of customer buying preferences. Joe Cardoso : Great. You appreciate the questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question today comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. George, I just wanted to better understand the current competitive landscape for fiber storage market, especially given the AI application. And I have a follow-up. George Kurian : It's always big competitive. There are different vendors that come and go in the market. I think if you look at the installed base of unstructured data, that becomes the vehicle to build data pipelines for AI and ML applications, NetApp has a very strong position. And we have the only solutions that allow customers to build hybrid cloud pipelines to build solutions that are super scalable and high performance. But also have the security protection and data management that AI will need as these models get scaled. So I feel really good about our position and look forward to continuing to expand our presence in that market. Mehdi Hosseini : Maybe perhaps I could rephrase my question. Mike just, raised is product gross margin to 60%, which is pretty much what you're guiding for the January quarter. You're also increasing use of QLC. So should we anticipate some flexibility with pricing that QLC gives you, by remaining competitive with your competitors? Because I don't see gross margins already at work the new target is. So where do we go from here? George Kurian : Listen, I think that, first of all, the mix shift from hard drives to flash, in our business continues. And it's an important kind of underlying factor that gives us confidence that we are raising the structural baseline product gross margin, as Mike said, from the mid-50s, which has been a historic norm to the upper-50s and up to 60%. The mix shift is the most important lever in that equation. The second, of course, is the value of our ONTAP Software and the ongoing management of the commodity supply chain. I think all of those, factor in. I think that we are uniquely positioned with our operating system to benefit from using QLC in a broad bench of applications. Currently, only another one other vendor has QLC based all-flash arrays, and it gives us an opportunity to go target other vendors who don't have QLC support. So we feel really good about our solution. And I would tell you that AI and all of these enterprise applications are not just about price. They're about value, and we built a real good value for our customers over many years. Mehdi Hosseini : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Mike Cadiz : Hi, good afternoon. This is Mike Cadiz for Asiya at Citi. So my one question is, given ongoing -- in the AI field, given ongoing security and data sovereignty concerns by many companies, is there anything notable in the customer conversations regarding AI model placements, whether on-prem or in the cloud or any other architecture preferences that they may have? George Kurian : Listen, I think that data is the foundation on, which AI is built. And if you look at what enterprises are doing today, they are augmenting foundational models with their own data to bring the relevance of AI to their business and their organizational needs. As a result, issues like malicious injection of bad data into a data landscape can cause huge impacts on AI, the ability to maintain data security, privacy, and lineage is are all conversations that are happening regardless of the regulatory environment, and they will only get stronger as the regulations get enforced like you are seeing, for example, in the European Union. This gives the needs to have data management across the life cycle of AI extreme importance, and we are exceptionally well-positioned, having the capabilities to build secure, private environments in the public cloud, as well as in customers' data centers. Mike Cadiz : Okay, got it. Thank you very much. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Nehal Chokshi : Hey, thanks, and congrats on the strong results here. Mike, can you give us some early thoughts on fiscal year 2025. And what are the key things we should be thinking about when modeling fiscal year 2025 here? Mike Berry : Yes. Thank you for the question, Nehal. So when going into fiscal 2025, we've talked about it, hey, we feel really good about the momentum that we have in Q3 as well as the guidance that we built in Q4. We've talked about the momentum around C-Series. George talked about all the industry, trends that are also tailwinds for us. And when you look at all of the priorities that our customers are looking at, we feel like we're really well-positioned. We've given you a good view of where we think our product gross margins will land. The support business continues to be an important driver of profitability as well. And we will continue to be prudent around our investment to make sure that we drive growth. We want to do that. We want to make sure that we are disciplined in our spending. But hey, there are some things that we also need to do and want to do to be able to continue to drive the top line. I think we've done a lot of great work around cloud to be in a much better position for next year. George talked about the 35%-plus growth in cloud storage in first-party marketplace. And Eddie asked that question as well. In the quarter, cloud storage continues to grow as a percentage. It's now closer to 65% from a revenue perspective. So that's where the growth will be. And then, we will continue to do the right things around return of capital to shareholders. We always want to leave flexibility for investments, but we also want to make sure that we're mindful of our share count. So without trying to guide 2025, that's only the best Readers Digest version, I can give you. Nehal Chokshi : That's fantastic. If I may, how should we think about the support revenue? You're coming off 4 quarters of year-over-year product revenue declines now that you're back into year-over-year growth on the product revenue, how long do you expect the Support revenue start to cut back up basically? Mike Berry : Yes, great question. And we look at this a lot, obviously. So in the last two quarters, we've seen deferred revenue actually decline year-over-year. A couple of things to haul, keep in mind, that what you see on the balance sheet as a total deferred, it also includes cloud that has declined a little bit more than the Support business in the last two quarters. 90% plus Support will come off the balance sheet, so you can take a hard look at that. But what we've also seen is a different trend where instead of tech refreshes we've seen a lot of customers renew their Support for up to a year, and that has also helped continue to drive Support revenue. You don't see that as much in deferred. But the big driver will be growth in product revenue drives additional Support revenue with the multiyear Support. You'll see that in billings. You'll see that in deferred revenue. So we feel good about being able to get that growth in Support. I think it was 2% this year, hopefully, at least that and going forward, if product -- when product revenue grows, support revenue should follow. It will be a little bit of a lagging indicator a couple of quarters, but it will definitely follow because of the business model. Nehal Chokshi : Fantastic. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead. Ananda Baruah : Yes. Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the question. Yes. Congrats I mean congrats on a strong number of quarters here and really good ongoing execution. And I guess George, that's I guess what I'd like to ask, I guess the first question is -- and I'm sorry if you spoke to some of this, I was -- there's a few calls going on tonight. So I came on late. But to what degree the last couple of quarters or so, do you think that the strong product growth that you guys have put up. I'm going to try to actually parse to the degree that's possible. Is the result of new product features, kind of new products, things that customers are doing beginning to do sort of differently with their data? It sounds like not really a material GNA benefit yet, which makes sense. But if you could parse -- if there's any way to parse through those things, that would be helpful. And then, I guess the second part of the question is, I think I heard you make mention of you think there is like a tail to this going forward. And I mean is part of what you're saying is that you think the product demand sort of outlook begins to look a lot different as you go through calendar 2024 and then maybe even beyond? I know that's a lot, but I'd appreciate that. Thanks. George Kurian : Yes. Listen, I think, first of all, the macro has stayed relatively consistent the whole time. It is uncertain. It's not getting worse, but it is not the fundamental reason for the improvement in results. The second is the two biggest reasons for improving our results. One is product and the second is focus on go-to-market execution. Let me hit on, in terms of product, we brought the world's best operating system to two or three major new opportunities. We brought it to a price point in the all-flash market that we have not addressed before with the QLC flash offerings. We brought the world's best operating system to a block storage opportunity that multibillion dollars, multiple tens of billion dollars that we had never built a purpose-built block storage product for. And we are continuing to see an expanding range of AI opportunities as customers are doing both training as well as building context called retrieval augmented generation drag. And so all of those have driven improvements in our results. I think the other part of the equation would be to recognize the benefits that we've had from focus in our go-to-market. We have prioritized two areas; the hyperscaler marketplace and first-party cloud storage services in public cloud. And we have focused on our all-flash portfolio as the two major priorities, and we have had strong results in both of them, and I'm very pleased with the results. Ananda Baruah : That's great context. I appreciate that. And just a quick follow-up for Mike here. Mike, you talked about attach in some context. And I guess I just wanted to ask you with the operating margins already in the high 20s, philosophically, is there any reason why with everything you have going on with mix and attach over time, you couldn't touch 30% operating margin? Mike Berry : So we did this quarter, Ananda. Ananda Baruah : Sorry, it's funny. I haven't -- yes, I apologize. I have to with all the numbers I had you didn't -- that's a miss on me. So well, let me just ask you then, let's start there. Like I mean, should we just expect mix up then going forward? I mean, how are you thinking about like showing the margins in the P&L versus doing something else with the op income dollars as mix continues to work in your favor? Thanks. Mike Berry : Yes. And no apologies necessary. I know you folks are busy today. So hey, we're super excited about the 30% margin. And a lot of that. There's all 12,000 employees that helped us on that number. We've guided to 27% to 28% inQ4. What I would say is that we very much want to continue to be able to grow the business. And even as a CFO, I know, hey, we need to invest in some areas. There are some product investments that we need to make. We want to make sure that the go-to-market continues to have sales capacity. We've said it at the last Analyst Day, we'll say it again, which is we want to invest, but our goal is always to grow OpEx at a lower rate than revenue to drive the margins up. Where those go really depends, I think, on a couple of things. One is how well we can continue to grow product revenue, that's obviously a big piece. And that then drives storage, which was Nehal's question around -- I'm sorry, around which is a big piece. So we don't have a target in mind. And quite frankly, the other thing I just want to make sure and underline, this is both gross -- product gross margins and operating margins. Hey, we love the dollars more. And so our goal is to be able to drive dollars. That may mean that, hey, margins stay relatively consistent or they go up or down in a quarter. Our goal is to drive more revenue, more gross margin dollars, more operating that then goes to EPS. So I don't want to give you a target. Now we'll talk about this a little bit in June. There is that trade-off. Ananda Baruah : Thank you. That\u2019s super helpful. Thanks a lot, Mike. Mike Berry : Thanks, Ananda Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Irvin Liu : Hi. Thank you for the question. This is Irvin Liu on for Amit. George, you mentioned new customer wins resulting from the displacement of competitor 10K hard disk drive and hybrid deployments with C Series. But can you give us a sense on what the upsell opportunity looks like for some of your other product lines such as A series and public cloud services, particularly with these new customers. George Kurian : Listen, we always start with one environment, and then we can cross-sell other environments into the customer. I think what we have seen quite clearly in the market is that the idea of having multiple different operating systems and storage landscapes in our customer is causing cost, complexity and security vulnerabilities and the idea of going to one consistent architecture across multiple landscapes is clearly seeing resonance and customers. And I think that as we have got obviously both unified, as well as block focused offerings across high-performance AFF A Series, as well as more value-oriented C-Series products, we see opportunity to not only win one part of our customers' footprint, but over time, win all of their footprint. The work that we've done in public cloud allows us to penetrate accounts that we don't have a relationship with using the public cloud sales motion. And as we have shared many times, the number of new to NetApp customers in the public cloud sales motion is very strong, and we are excited about that. We continue to see good progress on that front even this past quarter. Irvin Liu : Thanks. I also had one follow-up. Just on the dip in your mix of U.S. public sector revenue. Was there anything to call out here just in terms of government IT spending? George Kurian : It's just normal seasonality. I think public sector actually was a strong number for us across the globe and nothing other than normal seasonality for us. Irvin Liu : Got it. That\u2019s all I had. Thank you. Kris Newton : All right. Thanks, Irvin.. I'm going to pass it back to George now for some closing comments. George Kurian : Thank you, Kris. Let me reiterate my strong confidence in our position to drive continued growth and profitability despite the uncertain macro. We've sharpened our focus, improved our execution and successfully introduced new products that expand our addressable market. Capacity flash, block storage and AI all represent enormous opportunities for us. We are performing well in these areas and expect continued growth. We have taken the actions needed to improve the health of our cloud business, creating our healthier business to drive growth in fiscal 2025. We are capitalizing on our share gain opportunity and we'll maintain the operating discipline that has yielded record profitability. Thank you for your time today, and I hope to see you at our June 11, Investor Day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kris Newton : Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Mike Berry. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, including, without limitation, our guidance for the first quarter and fiscal year 2025; our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability and shareholder returns; and other growth initiatives and strategies. These statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may cause our actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC and on our website, including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP, unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to George. George Kurian : Thank you, Kris. Welcome, everyone. We concluded FY '24 on a high note, demonstrating robust performance in the fourth quarter and building positive momentum as we step into FY '25. Our revenue for both Q4 and FY '24 exceeded the midpoint of our guidance, reflecting the strong growth of our expanded all-flash portfolio. Throughout FY '24, we maintained a high level of operational discipline, leading to company records for annual gross margin, operating margin, earnings per share, operating cash flow, and free cash flow. At the start of FY '24, we implemented a plan to enhance the performance of our storage business and build a more focused approach to the Public Cloud business, while managing the elements within our control in an uncertain macro environment. This plan has yielded tangible results, and our value proposition is resonating strongly in the marketplace. Customers are increasingly turning to NetApp to help them build intelligent data infrastructures and leverage the power of public and hybrid clouds for rapidly growing, data-intensive workloads like AI, cloud-native, open-source, and enterprise applications, while ensuring their data remains secure and protected from ransomware attacks. NetApp uniquely delivers a comprehensive and integrated portfolio of unified data storage solutions based on one operating system, ONTAP, supporting any application, any data type, and spanning on-premises and multiple cloud environments. We deliver unparalleled simplicity of data management, and infrastructure and application deployment with consistent automation, all unified by common APIs and a single control plane. In a world of limited IT resources, rapid data growth, and escalating cybersecurity threats, we empower customers with the flexibility to rapidly deploy new applications, unify their data for AI, simplify cloud integration, and strengthen data protection. Now to the results of the quarter. We delivered robust year-over-year performance in our Hybrid Cloud segment, with revenue growth of 6% and product revenue growth of 8%. Strong customer demand for our broad portfolio of modern all-flash arrays, particularly the C-series capacity flash and ASA block optimized flash, was again ahead of our expectations. This demand propelled our all-flash array annualized revenue run rate to an all-time high at $3.6 billion, up 17% year-over-year. Early in Q1 of FY '25, we unveiled our new all-flash A series unified data storage products, offering customers enhanced performance and effective density at a lower cost than the previous A series generation. These products set a new standard for enterprise storage, enabling customers to turbocharge workloads ranging from traditional enterprise applications to GenAI. The new AFF A-series, coupled with our highly successful C-series and TAM expanding ASA product, position us to further increase our share in the all-flash market. Keystone, our Storage-as-a-Service offering was also a highlight of the quarter. Keystone provides cloud like management for hybrid cloud resources in a single subscription with flexible multiyear contracts that align storage costs with business needs, enabling rapid response to changing capacity and performance requirements. We consistently hear from customers that our integrated service level assurance, with performance, availability, ransomware recovery, and sustainability guarantees, is our differentiator. This has enabled us to accelerate growth by displacing competitors' storage-as-a-service subscriptions, winning new Keystone subscriptions, and expanding existing ones. FY '24 total contract value sales of Keystone more than doubled from the prior year to almost $150 million. We expect this momentum to continue and that FY '25 will be another significant growth year for Keystone. A leading semiconductor manufacturer selected Keystone as the vehicle to consolidate its storage needs. Initially aiming to select one vendor for block and another for file, we established ourselves as their single global standard for both environments, displacing the incumbent for block storage. This multi-year eight-figure deal allowed the customer to reduce the complexity and improve the availability of their storage environment. AI is a top priority for organizations as they seek to accelerate innovation, revolutionize operations, drive competitive advantage, and deliver superior solutions to their customers. Data management is essential for enterprise AI. Customers choose NetApp to support them at every phase of the AI lifecycle due to our high performance all-flash storage complemented by comprehensive data management capabilities that support requirements from data preparation, model training and tuning, retrieval-augmented generation or RAG, and inferencing, as well as requirements for responsible AI including model and data versioning, data governance and privacy. We continue to strengthen our position in enterprise AI, focusing on making it easier for customers to derive value from their AI investments. In Q4, we introduced NetApp AIPod with C-series capacity flash systems, delivering a new level of cost and performance, rack space utilization, and sustainability. In conjunction with Cisco, we updated FlexPod AI reference architectures to support the NVIDIA AI Enterprise software platform, giving customers an end-to-end blueprint to efficiently design, deploy, and operate AI infrastructure. We were one of the first partners to complete the storage validation for NVIDIA OVX systems and at the start of Q1, we were the first to announce a full-stack OVX system. The NetApp AIPod with Lenovo ThinkSystem servers for NVIDIA OVX is optimized for GenAI and designed to support RAG. We announced much of this innovation at NVIDIA GTC, where we were honored to be recognized during the Keynote for our role in storing a significant portion of enterprises' unstructured data, which is the fuel for GenAI. Through our partnership with NVIDIA, we give customers the ability to talk directly to the large amount of existing data stored on NetApp on-premises and in the cloud, demonstrating the value of our installed base and this critical role we play in AI. We are the AI infrastructure of choice for one of the world's leading oil and gas companies. The company is developing its own large language model, using a high performance AI cluster with NetApp all-flash storage. They are now also building an AI Center of Excellence to support various departmental AI initiatives and have again selected NetApp storage for this part of their AI infrastructure, leveraging C-series to optimize price and performance. They are rapidly ramping up their AI infrastructure, building new models, and onboarding AI resources. They awarded us the deal over their AI server vendor because of our ability to remove to remove roadblocks in their AI workflows and accelerate the time to value from their AI investments. Public Cloud segment revenue was $152 million, up 1% year-over-year. First-party and hyperscaler marketplace storage services remain our priority and are growing rapidly, increasing more than 30% year-over-year and driving cloud storage services to two-thirds of total Public Cloud ARR. These offerings are highly differentiated and closely aligned with customers' purchase preferences. In Q4, we had a good number of takeouts of competitors' on-premises infrastructure with cloud storage services based on NetApp ONTAP technology, which helped drive our best quarter for cloud storage services with each of our hyperscaler partners. We are well ahead of the competition in cloud storage services and we are innovating to further extend our leadership position. In Q4, we further increased the performance of Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP, addressing an even broader set of performance intensive workloads. We also introduced a new service level for Google Cloud NetApp Volumes giving customers more granular control to match the capacity and performance needs of their cloud workloads. We were proud to receive Google Cloud's Technology Partner of the Year for Infrastructure, Storage for the second consecutive year. Reflecting on FY '24, I want to thank the NetApp team for their work to strengthen our position. We have a stronger, more complete all-flash portfolio are addressing a wider set of cloud storage workloads, and have a robust go-to-market plan, better positioning us to win across the board and in new markets like AI. Without question, our modern approach to unified data storage, spanning data types, price points, and hybrid multi-cloud environments is resonating in the market, giving us solid momentum as we enter the new fiscal year. Looking ahead to FY '25, we are cautiously optimistic on the macro environment. The backdrop is better now than it was at the start of FY '24. We will remain laser focused on our top priorities while continuing to raise the bar on execution and maintaining our operational discipline. NetApp is leading the evolution of the storage industry, helping our customers make their data infrastructure intelligent for the age of AI. I am confident that this leadership, coupled with the strong momentum we've built through FY '24 positions us for continued growth and share gains. I encourage you to attend or tune into our June 11th Investor Day to learn more about our long term strategy. Visit our investor relations website for more information. I'll now turn the call over to Mike. Mike Berry : Thank you, George, and good afternoon, everyone. As George noted, we are laser focused on managing the elements within our control. This focus enabled us to deliver strong P&L performance for Q4 and the full year. Before getting into the details, let me quickly highlight the key themes. As a reminder, all numbers discussed are non-GAAP unless otherwise noted. We delivered solid revenue growth in Q4, driven by our all-flash and cloud storage portfolio, which have strong momentum as we head into fiscal year '25. For Q4, our all-flash array revenue achieved a $3.6 billion annualized run rate, growing 17% year-on-year. Flash now accounts for approximately 60% of hybrid cloud revenue. Keystone, our Storage-as-a-Service offering delivered another strong quarter and a strong year, with revenue growth up triple-digits year-over-year in fiscal year '24. And first-party and marketplace cloud storage, the largest part of our cloud business grew double-digits quarter-over-quarter and over 30% year-over-year in Q4. Our operating profit margin was a record for a Q4 and operating cash flow was an all-time record. For the full year fiscal '24, product gross margins reached a record high of 60%, representing around 1,000 basis points of year-over-year improvement, driven by product mix, lower SSD costs and a normalizing supply chain environment. We have an increasing share of total revenue derived from higher margin and recurring revenue sources, which we expect to continue into fiscal '25. In fiscal '24, we generated $1.53 billion in free cash flow, a 76% year-over-year increase compared to fiscal year of '23, and an all-time high. And we returned 86% of fiscal '24 free cash flow to shareholders, through $900 million of share repurchases and around $400 million of dividends. Our share repurchases resulted in a reduction of full year diluted share count by approximately 3% from the prior year. We plan to continue a strong policy of shareholder returns in fiscal '25 and are announcing today an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.50 to $0.52. Furthermore, today, we are announcing an increase to our share repurchase authorization by another $1 billion. Now to the details of Q4. Revenue came in slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range at $1.67 billion, up 6% year-over-year and up 4% quarter-over-quarter. Q4 billings of $1.81 billion were up 8% year-over-year. This marks our second straight quarter of year-over-year revenue and billings growth. Q4 Hybrid Cloud revenue of $1.52 billion was up 6% year-over-year. Product revenue was $806 million and up 8% year-over-year. Support revenue of $623 million increased 4% year-over-year. Public Cloud ARR exited the year at $630 million, up 2% year-over-year and up $22 million from Q3. Public Cloud revenue composed 9% of total revenue in Q4 and grew 1% year-over-year to $152 million. We exited fiscal '24 with $4.23 billion in deferred revenue, a decrease of 2% year-over-year, consistent with the year-over-year decrease in Q3. Q4 consolidated gross margin was approximately 71.5%. Total Hybrid Cloud gross margin was 72%. Product gross margin was 61%, a 130 basis points ahead of our prior guidance, driven by better mix and continued growth in our C-series products. Our recurring support business continues to be highly profitable, with gross margin of 92%. Public Cloud gross margin increased 290 basis points both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year to 68%. Q4 again highlighted the strength of our business model and our operational discipline with operating margin of 28%, the highest for a Q4 in the history of NetApp and the second only to last quarter's 30% operating margin. EPS of $1.80 was $0.02 ahead of guidance of $1.78, predominantly driven by better gross margins. As a reminder, we had a one-time improvement in our tax rate in Q3 that normalized towards our usual low 20% range in Q4, which was contemplated in our prior guidance. In Q4, cash flow from operations was $613 million and free cash flow was $567 million. These cash flow metrics came in above our expectations in Q4 due to higher customer collections, lower tax payments, and lower supply chain payments. During Q4, we repurchased $100 million in stock and paid out $104 million in dividends. Q4 diluted share count of 212 million was down 2% year-over-year. We had approximately $500 million left on our current share repurchase authorization as of the end of fiscal '24, and today, we are announcing an increase in that authorization by another $1 billion. Before moving to guidance, let's review the results for the full year of fiscal '24. Revenue of $6.27 billion was down 1% year-over-year and billings of $6.25 billion were down 2% year-over-year. Disciplined operational management yielded all-time fiscal year highs for operating margin and EPS. For fiscal '24, operating margin was 27%, up 260 basis points year-over-year, driven predominantly by 450 basis points of year-over-year improvement in gross margins, slightly offset by the small year-over-year revenue decline and targeted operating expense growth. For fiscal '24, operating cash flow was $1.69 billion and free cash flow was $1.53 billion, both all-time company highs. Our balance sheet remains very healthy. We closed the year with $3.25 billion in cash and short-term investments against $2.4 billion in total debt. Now to guidance, starting with fiscal '25. Let me underscore our confidence in our strategy and the strength of our position in addressing key customer priorities, such as business analytics, AI, cloud transitions, data security, and application modernization. Macro indicators today are better than a year ago. However, while there has been some improvement, in our view, the macro environment remains unsettled. As a result, we expect fiscal '25 total revenue to be in the range of $6.45 to $6.65 billion, which at the midpoint, reflects 4.5% year-over-year growth. Implied in our fiscal '25 revenue guidance is year-over-year revenue growth in each quarter of fiscal '25. While we are not providing specific Cloud revenue guidance, we do expect Public Cloud revenue to return to consistent growth in fiscal '25. We expect fiscal '25 consolidated gross margin to be roughly 71% to 72%, consistent with fiscal '24 gross margins despite the pressure coming from rising NAND component costs. We expect growth in support and cloud gross profit to help maintain our overall gross margins. Implied in this guidance is growth year-over-year in gross profit dollars, which is our focus. We have secured a large majority of our forecasted SSD demand for fiscal '25, albeit at higher prices than fiscal '24. Given our existing inventory levels and the forecasted use of our pre-buy supply, product gross margins are expected to be higher in the first half of fiscal '25, as we utilize our inventory, compared to the second half of fiscal '25. We remain confident in our long-term Public Cloud gross margin target of 75% to 80% and expect to make progress in fiscal '25 towards this target. We anticipate operating margins of 27% to 28% and EPS of $6.80 to $7. For the year, we expect a tax rate in the range of 21% to 22%. We expect operating cash flow will move in line with net income, although, there will be some quarterly variance based on working capital, especially in Q1, when we will pay our annual incentive compensation plans. Our anticipated healthy cash generation enables us to continue our strong return of capital to shareholders. In fiscal '25, we intend to return up to 100% of free cash flow to shareholders in share buybacks and dividends. Our conviction in future cash flow generation is driving the increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.52 per share in fiscal '25, with the remainder of free cash flow going to share buybacks. We expect to reduce share count by approximately 1% to 2% in fiscal '25. Now on to Q1 guidance. We expect Q1 revenue to range between $1.455 billion and $1.605 billion, which at the midpoint implies growth of 7% year-over-year. We expect Q1 consolidated gross margin to be roughly 72% and operating margin to be approximately 25%. EPS should be in the range between $1.40 and $1.50. In closing, I want to echo George's appreciation of the NetApp team and their continued focus and execution in this uncertain environment. As I look forward into fiscal '25, I am confident in our strategy and our ability to capture our growing set of opportunities and increase profitability. I'll now turn the call over to Kris for Q&A. Kris Newton : Thanks, Mike. Operator, let's begin the Q&A. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead. David Vogt : Great. Thank you, guys for taking my question. Maybe, George, to start, you spent some time talking about the competitive successes that you had in the quarter and the strength of both the A-series and the C-series. Can you maybe expand upon that relative to sort of what you're seeing in the macro? I mean, there's a lot of discussion in the market, not just for storage, but in IT for general macro headwinds and it doesn't appear to be a big factor for you this quarter. And then with regards to Keystone, you talked about some displacements because of a whole host of factors with the offering. Can you maybe expand upon what were some of the more important factors? You mentioned performance. Was price a consideration, or is it really the suite of solutions, the suite of offerings that really drives sort of that Keystone success? And can you maybe talk about the average length of these agreements? Are these two to three year agreements? Any color there would be helpful. Thank you. George Kurian : Thank you for the question. Listen, we are cautiously optimistic on the macro. As you noticed, it's better than we started the prior year, but there's still a good amount of uncertainty and caution in customer spending. They are prioritizing the applications like analytics, unifying their data for AI, modernizing their environment, and dealing with disruptions from changes like VMware. And we have had really good success across all of those landscapes. We've had strong wins across multiple elements of the AI opportunity from data lakes to model training to RAG on our customers' installed data. And we see that across multiple verticals. We've had strong success with our offerings displacing VxRail and other hyper converged platforms that customers look to optimize their VMware landscapes. And in the case of Keystone, which has had a really strong year, every quarter of the year has been strong and we had a really, really strong Q4. What we are seeing is customers like the idea of a unified, integrated data platform for all of their data and a cloud like experience. What we are able to offer uniquely in the market is the same experience in your data center, as in a co-location environment, as in all the leading public clouds. And so, the value of the flexibility that we offer, and the operational consistency and simplicity is what's allowing us to win all these deals. And they're not on price, these are long-term architectural commitments that customers are making. And they are multi-year agreements. I'll leave it there. David Vogt : Perfect. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Matt Sheerin with Stifel. Please go ahead. Matt Sheerin : Yes. Thank you. George, regarding your outlook for growth for fiscal '25, 4.5% growth, which, as you say, reflects macro concerns, we are hearing another reason is that vendors focusing on AI investments, which are leading to push-outs of other projects, including both hardware and software. We heard from another -- a number of big companies just this week. Are you seeing signs of that as well in your business, or is that just -- are you just seeing continued cautiousness concerning all budgets? George Kurian : I think more of the latter. There's just generally continued scrutiny of spending. I think with regard to our outlook, we are very confident entering the year. We finished really strong. Our Flash portfolio has even got stronger in Q1 with the refresh of our A-series Flash products. So we feel really good with a really up to date A-series CAM expanding ASA product, which had a really strong quarter. And, of course, the C-series, which has been setting records for performance in our business. So, we feel really good. I think on the AI side, listen, we are the installed incumbent for the world's largest unstructured data set, and we are helping customers unify those data sets, building data lakes. We saw that, for example, in one of the world's largest genomics companies, where together with NVIDIA, we built a supercomputing environment that allows them to accelerate drug discovery. And then, we talked about the success we had at one of the world's largest oil and gas companies, where we not only built their supercomputer for a trillion parameter large language model, but we are also the backbone for all of their RAG at their AI Center of Excellence. So I feel really good about our ability to tap into the AI opportunity, as well as continue the leadership we've shown in traditional enterprise applications. Matt Sheerin : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : The next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Meta Marshall : Great. Thanks. Maybe the first question, just on the first-party and marketplace cloud storage strength, is there any trends that you're seeing with the type of customer? Is that somebody who is an existing NetApp customer or those largely new customers? Just any trends of who are those customers where you're seeing that strength? And then, maybe just the second question for Mike. It would seem that Q1 is starting seasonally strong, at least in comparison with last year, which maybe was seasonally weak. Is some of that A-series launch -- just how to think about how A-series launch impacts the seasonality of the year? Thanks. George Kurian : I'll take the first question, Meta. On the cloud storage side, the first-party and marketplace storage services, which are our focus, have had strong results throughout the year. In Q4, we continued to see a really good balance of new customers that are new to NetApp, including competitive displacement, bringing competitor footprints to cloud on our platform, as well as a mix of existing NetApp customers who were deploying and migrating workloads to the cloud, and expansions, where a customer might have not had a first-party service like in Google, now expanding on our first-party Google Cloud service. So good balance across the board sets us up to have a continued strong outlook for cloud storage this coming year. Mike? Mike Berry : Thank you, George. Thanks for the question, Meta. So yes, we do expect Q1 to be seasonally strong. As you mentioned, Q1 of last year was seasonally weak, so it is one of the easier compares, I'll say, for the year. In reference to the A-series launch, we're super excited about it. That is something that's just gotten started, though, so it won't have a big impact on Q1. We do expect that though, to start driving some nice trajectory as we move through fiscal '25. Meta Marshall : Great. Thank you. George Kurian : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I guess, George, you talked about the support and sort of the infrastructure that you're providing your customers as they go through their AI deployments and the wins you have. I was just curious if you can give us a bit more sense about how to then translate that into revenue, particularly when I think about sort of fiscal '25 guide here, how much of that is incorporated in terms of those deployments in your revenue and how to think about that ramping in the out year. And a quick follow-up for Mike. Mike, if you can just help me with the puts and takes in terms of gross margin variance between Q3 and Q4, that will be helpful in terms of what the headwinds and tailwinds were. Thank you. George Kurian : Listen, broadly speaking, we had about more than 50 AI wins in Q4 across all elements of the AI landscape I talked about, both in data foundations like data lakes as well as model training and inferencing across all of the geographies. I would tell you that in the AI market, the ramp on AI servers will be much ahead of storage because what clients our doing is they're building new computing stacks but using their existing data. And so we expect that over time there will be a lot more data created and unified to continue to feed the model. But at this stage, we are in proof of concept. We think that there's a strong opportunity over time for us and all of the AI growth is factored into our guidance for next year. Mike Berry : And on your follow-up, Samik, on gross margins from Q3 to Q4, so as we talked about in the prepared remarks, we did come in about 130 basis points higher on product margins. We had guided around 60%. That was largely due to better mix. As we had talked about, we did expect that to come down from Q3 just because it was our Q4 and that's largely what happened. We support gross margin very consistent. And importantly, we started to see a nice increase in our cloud gross margins and we expect that to continue in the next year. So pretty consistent performance Q3 to Q4 in our gross margin line. Samik Chatterjee : Thank you. Thanks for taking the questions. Operator : The next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Mike, when I look at your Q1 operating margin guide, I believe, in the context of fiscal year, it seems like you're going to exit FY '25 in the high 20% operating margin, 29% to be exact. Does that 29% operating margin exiting FY '25 include all the OpEx leverage given the resizing that you went through last year? Mike Berry : Yeah. So we got it in full year, 27% to 28% operating margin. And yes, operating margin was always a little bit lower on a percentage in Q1 just given the seasonality. So I think what you're referring to, Mehdi, is we did do the restructuring last year in Q4. As we enter fiscal '25, we do have some leverage continuing in OpEx. We do expect OpEx to grow, I'm going to say, about 2% for the full year basis on a revenue guide of about 4.5%. We are doing targeted hiring in sales and in engineering to drive key product initiatives. Outside of that, as we've always said, our goal is to always drive operating leverage in the business and have OpEx grow at a rate less than OpEx -- than revenue growth, excuse me. Mehdi Hosseini : But you did 30% operating margin in January at a lower revenue run rate. Why shouldn't we be able to meet or exceed 30% operating margin given your reduced footprint? George Kurian : Yeah. So, the 30%, keep in mind, that was the highest that we saw in our gross margin numbers. And we have talked about many of those starting higher in fiscal '25 and then coming down as we go through the year as we go through the pre-buys that we have for SSD. So, it is significantly influenced by that gross margin number. We'd love to get back to the 30%. At this point, a lot of that depends on where the gross margin line goes. Mehdi Hosseini : Okay. Thank you. George Kurian : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Please go ahead. Steven Fox : Hi, Mike. Just to follow up on his points on pre-buys, can you just maybe further outline your strategy in terms of pre-buys? Would you continue to do that six months out, 12 months out, etc., or is it more depending on how you view the market? And along those lines, can you give us a better sense for sort of the gross margin headwinds as you get into the second half from the higher NAND costs? Thanks. Mike Berry : Sure. So, as we talked about, we were very active in pre-buys for fiscal '24. As we talked about in the prepared remarks, we have locked in a large majority of our forecasted SSDs for '25, albeit at prices higher than '24, as you would expect, Steve. And really, when we look at that, we look at where the market is, we look at obviously our demand, and where we think the prices are going to go. The supply chain team has been very active in this market, and we think it's an important part of protecting our margins. At this point, we are still comfortable with the full year 58% to 60% range that we talked about in product gross margins for fiscal '25. The variables there are potential further increases or decreases in NAND costs through the rest of the year, and then, of course, storage market pricing plays into it. I do want to reiterate, hey, we are focused on driving the top-line growth and driving additional gross margin dollars and EPS while being disciplined in pricing. We certainly continue to look at product gross margin percentages, but at the end of the day, we will focus on driving profitable revenue growth and margin dollars. So again, 58% to 60% for the full year, starting higher in the first half, and then scaling down as we go through the year. Steven Fox : Great. That's helpful. Thank you. George Kurian : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Simon Leopold : Thanks for taking the question. I did catch the comment that you expect public cloud services to grow through the year. I just want to see if we can maybe get a refresh on what's changing in that business that's getting us back to growth, and maybe if you could quantify what you mean in terms of your contributions with some more numbers, I'd appreciate it. Thank you. George Kurian : Yeah. Listen, a couple of quarters ago, we said that we were taking action to sharpen the focus of our public cloud business. Those are along two dimensions. The first was to continue to drive the execution of a growth strategy around our first-party and hyperscaler storage services. As we said, storage is now about two-thirds of the total cloud business, and first-party and marketplace cloud storage services are the preponderant majority of our cloud storage. And that has performed really, really well and is the foundation for long-term success and growth in cloud. Second, we said that the subscription business had headwinds related to cloud optimization, and we took several actions to improve the health of our subscription business. As a reminder, we said that subscription was about a fifth of the total cloud business, so a small part, and we took actions to both stop selling certain products and services that were no longer a part of our go-forward plan, to migrate some customers from our subscription offerings to our first-party cloud consumption offerings, to integrate some of the subscription products as being features of our cloud storage offerings, and to be able to sharpen the value proposition of our subscription offerings and work with our customer success team to improve the value to the client. What this has resulted in is a decrease in subscription revenue in the second half of this year, as we forecast, but the headwinds from that decrease are getting smaller and smaller, and over the course of the first half of next year, we feel that a large part of those headwinds will be mitigated. We expect that cloud first-party and marketplace cloud storage should continue to ramp strongly, which will deliver overall growth in cloud, consistent revenue growth in cloud in fiscal year '25, stronger in the second half than in the first half. Simon Leopold : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Yes. Thank you so much for taking the question. I was wondering, Mike, did I hear correctly you say that the range of product growth margin could be between 50% to 60% starting at sort of the high end of that range and maybe closing out somewhere towards the lower end of that range? Could you clarify that? Mike Berry : Yeah. So, Wamsi, so sorry if -- hopefully, I said it correctly. What we talked about is we're still comfortable with the 58% to 60% range in product growth margins for the full year, starting out higher in the first half and then sliding down as we go through the second half and use the inventory of pre-buys. Wamsi Mohan : Okay. I mean, historically when you looked at the swing in product gross margins given change in commodity pricing, you've had two impacts. First one is just sort of your ability to pass some of that through on your top-line. And secondarily, the swing on product gross margin has been a little bit larger. So, could you just maybe talk through maybe 400 basis points or 500 basis points, maybe historically, Mike, and correct me if I'm wrong there, but can you just talk through sort of what is the upside on revenue that you're thinking could come from pass-through of the increased NAND cost in the second half and why is it not quite as wide this time around when presumably you've done pre-buys in the past too? Thank you. George Kurian : Listen, I'll take that question in two parts, one on the revenue side and the second on the gross margin side. On the revenue side, we continue to believe that customers budget in dollars, not in systems. And so, while we expect that the industry will follow the normal course of behavior, which is to raise prices to customers as commodity prices go up, we don't expect that to translate into directly increasing revenue. Customers will buy smaller amounts of storage if they have to pay more for it, but they will spend the dollars budgeted for it, and that's what's reflected in our top-line. With regard to cost of goods sold, I think, first of all, as Mike said, we have completed a large percentage of our forecasted demand for NAND through the course of next year, and as we have said before, NAND is less than 50% of our total cost of goods, the rest of which is flat. The outlook we are providing is based on our current -- is based on current market pricing. If the overall market raises prices as we have done in the past, we expect to follow the market, and that should be accreted to the outlook that we have provided. Mike Berry : And if I could just add one thing, Wamsi, and you asked about the volatility of the margins, keep in mind that in fiscal '23 we had to deal with the premium issue, that then went away. So that's caused a lot of it. Fiscal '24 was really 55% to 61%, so just keep that in mind as you look at fiscal '23, please. Wamsi Mohan : Okay. Thank you so much. Operator : The next question is from Tim Long with Barclays. Please go ahead. Tim Long : Thank you. Two also, if I could. First, [Technical Difficulty] Can you hear me? Kris Newton : No, you are off with static. I think you might need to dial back into the queue. All right. Next question, please. Operator : Tim, if you can hear us, we'll move on, but you can dial back into the queue at any time. The next question is from Nehal Chokshi with Northland Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Nehal Chokshi : Yeah. Thank you. Given the discussion around the driver of the 10% Q-on-Q increase in first-party marketplace cloud storage, it sounds like this is a sustainable driver. So, is it fair to expect that the public, the cloud storage, and first-party marketplace year-over-year growth will accelerate as we go through fiscal year '25 here? George Kurian : We expect public cloud storage, particularly first-party and marketplace, which are the focus of our cloud efforts to continue to grow nicely through the course of the year. I'm not going to comment about sequential growth rate each quarter. We had a really nice quarter this quarter, and we had a good year all year. I think that we see that first-party and cloud storage and marketplace is a much bigger part of our overall cloud business entering fiscal year '25 than it was entering fiscal year '24. And the rest of the offerings, as I said, we continue to sharpen the focus and be more targeted in terms of our subscription offerings. They will have a little bit more headwinds in the first half of the year, but we expect cloud to grow consistently in FY '25, stronger in the second half than in the first. Nehal Chokshi : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Tim Long with Barclays. Please go ahead. Tim Long : Thank you. I'll try it again with a different headset. Sorry about that. Just wanted to touch on the QLC C-series business. It seems like there's been some competitors trying to get into that piece of the market as well. So, two-parter. Number one, what do you think the increased competition would mean for that business, for NetApp? And then secondly, if you could just remind us, that business has been very successful for you. Can you talk a little bit about how that business has been going, meaning, has this been a lot of success with new customers or keeping your own base that's upgrading from hybrid systems? Any help there would be great. Thank you. George Kurian : Yeah. Thanks for the question. With regard to upgrading an existing hybrid flash customer to our C-series, there are enormous advantages for a customer of NetApp to stay in place because we have the same operating system, the same management console, the same telemetry system, and we can do that virtually seamlessly for customers. And so, we've seen a good chunk of upgrades from 10K drive environments to our all-flash, and we expect that to continue over time. Those will come up as customers upgrade their fleet in a periodic and steady fashion. We also saw a lot of new to NetApp environments in our customers where we were able to either displace competitive footprints and/or bring new footprints to NetApp as customers deployed new applications. We talked about the example with Keystone in a large customer that was considering two different approaches, one for file and one for block, and decided to unify on NetApp. We have seen several environments where hyper-converged VMware landscapes are now moving to optimize the cost of their VMware licenses and are using C-series. And over time, we just introduced the C-series AI part that gives clients a cost-effective capacity flash-based AI model training and inferencing environment. So, we're excited about the prospects with C-series. Listen, everybody will have their alternatives in the market. We feel really good about the fact that we have the industry's most comprehensive data management, the only real hybrid cloud solution, and a track record of having really large-scale data management capabilities on our flash products. And we feel very, very confident getting into next year. Nehal Chokshi : Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead. Ananda Baruah : Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Good afternoon. George, maybe just actually picking up right there, is there a useful way to think about which of these kind of opportunities you've been stepping into are sort of the most accretive through the fiscal year? And I believe you were talking, I think, like the last few quarters, I'm saying few loosely, it's kind of been ASA San opportunity and the 10K Drive opportunity. Is there any way to, I don't know, like sort of anecdotally, not force RAG, but give us context about around which opportunities are going to be the biggest catalyst as you go through the year? Thanks a lot. George Kurian : We have four growth opportunities that we are focused on, all-flash storage, block storage, cloud storage, and AI. And let me get each of those in turn. In all-flash storage, we have seen strong success with high-performance flash replacing legacy frame array and sort of traditional mainframe class storage with much more modern high-performance landscapes. We have seen the C-series both replace hyperconverged as well as traditional hybrid flash architectures, upgrading both our install base and competitor install bases. With the ASA platform, which is block, the second part of the growth opportunity, that is TAM-expanding for NetApp. And we are excited at the wins that we've seen and the momentum that we have. It will be a smaller business this coming year relative to the C-series and the AFF A-series, but it will be all TAM-expanding for NetApp. And I'm excited at where we are today. With cloud storage, listen, the cloud market is an enormous market. It's a multi-billion-dollar opportunity, and our cloud storage is a part of that opportunity. As the cloud providers have seen a reacceleration in their business, we are well positioned to grow our business and our focus is to grow it at a rate higher than the infrastructure-as-a-service growth rates of the big hyper-scalers. And then finally, AI, this is the opportunity that will become much more meaningful over time. We are well positioned with the huge installed base of unstructured data, which is the fuel for GenAI, and we are focused on helping customers do in-place RAG and inferencing of that data. Second, our unified data storage systems with integrated data services provide an ideal foundation for customers looking to build a data lake or model training landscapes. And then our hybrid cloud architecture gives us a unique place in the environment, allowing customers to use public cloud AI platforms such as Vertex from Google or Bedrock from AWS with their on-premises data and be able to scale inferencing to where every piece of customers' data and IT landscape exists. So, those are the four. We're excited about the year ahead. We will tell you more about the specific puts and takes of each opportunity at our Financial Analyst Day on June 11th. Ananda Baruah : Yeah. That's great, George. Thanks so much. Operator : The next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Eddie Pellon : Hey, guys. This is Eddie for Krish. When it comes to RAG applications, have you seen any increase in storage density per unit requirements? And I wonder, Kurian, if you can update us on your efforts of adopting 10 terabyte SSDs in your systems? Thank you. George Kurian : Listen, I think with the -- I didn't hear the question entirely clearly, but what we see with RAG is customers wanting to use a large amount of unstructured data alongside a model that has already been trained to get it even more aware of the context in which its operating. Our CCVs and ACVs are both well suited for that. For customers that want really large landscapes, we are really excited about the opportunity with the C-series where we already have 30 terabyte drives that are adding higher density drives as customers need. And then for large-scale data lakes, we are able to build highly dense object storage or mixed object and file storage landscapes that we have done for many, many clients over the last quarter. Eddie Pellon : Okay. Yeah. My question, George -- thank you. And my question was about 10 terabyte SSDs. So, it seems like that's already shipping in your systems as of today. Is that right? Mike Berry : We have 30 terabyte SSDs and they are growing quickly as a percentage of the total capacity. The way our systems are built, we can pass a lot more density into a single system than many of our competitors. Eddie Pellon : Got it. Thank you, George. George Kurian : Welcome. Operator : Thank you. Today's last question comes from Asiya Merchant with Citigroup. Please go ahead. Asiya Merchant : Great. Thanks. Apologize if this question has been asked, but maybe if I can just focus on the free cash flow for next year. I don't know if this is a guide that was provided for that and how you can think about how we should think about that and the shareholder returns for the fiscal year. Mike Berry : Sure. Thanks for asking the cash flow question. So, hey, we'll have a couple more minutes. As I talked about on the -- in the prepared remarks, we expect cash flow to continue to track with net income. So, if you take the midpoint of the guide, that says that net income does go up year-over-year. A couple of things. So, we would expect cash flow to move with it. During the year, there'll be some working capital changes and I just want to make sure I highlight these. Keep in mind that in Q1, we will pay our annual incentive compensation payments and incrementally year-over-year, thankfully, it's a relatively large number, it's about $150 million. We expect then collections to increase year-over-year. And then as long as we continue to purchase -- do pre-buys, we expect that to even out over the year as well. So all of that said, we would expect cash flow to -- operating cash flow to continue to track with net income. And from a CapEx perspective, we did about $155 million in fiscal '24. You should expect something relatively consistent with that in fiscal '25. And then that caps it off of capital allocation. We did increase the dividend from $0.50 a share to $0.52 a share. So, that will use call it $425 million of cash about for the year. The remainder of free cash flow is slated to go against share repurchases. Asiya Merchant : Great. Thank you. George Kurian : Thank you. Kris Newton : Thank you. I'll now pass it over to George for some final comments. George Kurian : Thanks, Kris. We ended FY '24 strong with robust performance in Q4 and building positive momentum entering FY '25. Capacity flash, block storage, cloud storage services, and AI all represent enormous growth opportunities for us. We are performing well and expect continued growth in these areas. NetApp is leading the evolution of the storage industry, helping our customers make their data infrastructure intelligent for the age of AI. We are capitalizing on our share gain opportunity and will maintain the operating discipline that has yielded record profitability. Thank you for your time today, and I hope to see you at our June 11th Investor Day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Kris Newton, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kris Newton : Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us. With me today are our CEO, George Kurian; and CFO, Mike Berry. This call is being webcast live and will be available for replay on our website at netapp.com. During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements and projections with respect to our financial outlook and future prospects, including, without limitation, our guidance for the second quarter and fiscal year 2025; our expectations regarding future revenue, profitability and shareholder returns; and other growth initiatives and strategies. These statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which may cause our actual results to differ materially. For more information, please refer to the documents we file from time-to-time with the SEC and on our website, including our most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. We disclaim any obligation to update our forward-looking statements and projections. During the call, all financial measures presented will be non-GAAP, unless otherwise indicated. Reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP estimates are available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to George. George Kurian : Thank you, Kris. Welcome everyone. We started FY25 strong, building on our momentum exiting last fiscal year. In Q1, we delivered 8% year-over-year revenue growth and set records for first quarter operating margin and EPS. These results are a testament to our strong execution in a continued uncertain macroeconomic environment, our unwavering confidence in the customer benefits of the highly differentiated NetApp intelligent data infrastructure platform, and our disciplined management of the business. As a result, we are raising our FY25 outlook for both revenue and profit. As we said during our recent investor day, we are focused on our uniquely differentiated solutions in flash, block, cloud storage, and AI. They address markets which are bolstered by both secular and company-specific tailwinds and represent our biggest opportunities to fuel revenue growth and increase market share. In Q1, we experienced notable momentum across all these areas, evidence that our value proposition is resonating. This focus, coupled with our dedication to innovation, drives my confidence in our continued success. Customers choose NetApp because we help them address their most important data challenges, leveraging the power of public and hybrid clouds to rapidly deploy new applications, unify their data for AI, simplify cloud integration, and strengthen data protection. We uniquely deliver a comprehensive and integrated storage and data management platform, giving our customers the power to unify all their data for any application, anywhere, and the ability to seamlessly and consistently manage it, while ensuring data remains secure and protected. We again delivered robust year-over-year performance in our Hybrid Cloud segment, with revenue growth of 8% and product revenue growth of 13%, driven by strength in all-flash storage. Broad-based demand across our all-flash storage portfolio propelled our all-flash array annualized revenue run rate to $3.4 billion, up 21% year-over-year. At the start of Q1, we introduced the new AFF A-series family of high-performance all-flash arrays capable of powering the most demanding environments from today\u2019s mission critical applications to tomorrow\u2019s GenAI workloads. Delivering the advanced data management, industry-leading ransomware protection, and cloud integration that modern workloads require, the new AFF A-series saw positive customer reception and performed ahead of our expectations. Both our capacity flash and block optimized all flash array families exhibited strong growth year-over-year, addressing an expanded TAM and driving share gains. In Q1, we had numerous competitive take-outs across a broad set of workloads and vertical markets as customers leveraged our C-series and ASA products to modernize their legacy infrastructures and deploy new applications like artificial intelligence. The ASA enabled us to capture a new-to-NetApp customer, displacing a legacy block storage competitor at a European-based manufacturer. The compelling price performance of the ASA, together with its modern architecture and comprehensive software capabilities, helped the customer realize savings as they refreshed their SAN environment. This is the first step in a larger relationship as the customer plans to purchase additional ASA systems to replace the remaining competitor footprint and evaluate our Public Cloud services Keystone, our Storage-as-a-Service offering was again a highlight this quarter, with revenue growing over 60% from Q1 a year ago. Keystone gives customers the operational agility and reduced financial risk they need to manage in a dynamic environment. A good example of this is a leading automotive supplier that chose Keystone to help address rapidly changing storage demands created by ongoing transformation of the automotive market. Keystone gives them the flexibility to manage rapid growth but also the ability to shrink based on changing circumstance. AI is the cornerstone of many of my customer conversations, reinforcing NetApp\u2019s position as a proven data infrastructure platform provider and thought leader in this space. Customers are selecting NetApp as their partner at every stage of the AI lifecycle because of our high-performance all-flash storage, unique cloud integration, and extensive data management capabilities. These capabilities support a wide range of needs, from data preparation, model training and tuning, to retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and inferencing and address the requirements for responsible AI, including model and data versioning, as well as data governance and privacy. While we believe the large opportunity for enterprise AI is still ahead of us, we are seeing good momentum today, with our AI business performing well ahead of our expectations. In Q1, we had over 50 AI and data lake modernization wins. I\u2019ll give you just a couple of examples. We were selected by another of the world's largest oil and gas companies for their AI and high-performance compute workloads. Our all-flash storage will power the customer's AI environment, servicing more than 40,000 CPU cores and GPU's which run simulations and 3D virtualization workloads. Additionally, we made it practical for a leading financial services institution to consolidate petabytes of data into a single data lake for AI and analytics workloads including fraud detection, credit scoring, and portfolio management and improving the productivity of their data scientists. Both instances are examples of how our deep understanding of and experience in AI workloads together with our intelligent data infrastructure platform help drive customer preference for NetApp infrastructure to service their growing AI requirements. We continue to advance our strong position with the development of GenAI cloud and on-premises solutions in partnership with industry leaders. In Q1, in partnership with Lenovo, we announced a full-stack OVX system, optimized for GenAI and designed to support RAG. Additionally, we introduced new capabilities designed for cloud AI workloads. We integrated the NetApp GenAI toolkit with Microsoft Azure NetApp Files, giving customers the ability to generate unique, high-quality, and ultra-relevant results from GenAI projects by combining their proprietary data with pre-trained, foundational models. In conjunction with AWS, we released a reference architecture for Amazon Bedrock to help customers implement RAG-enabled workflows that bring proprietary data stored on Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP into their GenAI data pipelines. GenAI is a truly hybrid workload and only NetApp has the breadth of products and services to reduce the complexity, resources, and risks for customers in managing these strategic workloads across increasingly complex hybrid multicloud environments. Public Cloud segment revenue was $159 million, up 3% year-over-year. Our highly differentiated first party and hyperscaler marketplace storage services remain our focus and top priority. These services continue to grow rapidly, increasing roughly 40% year-over-year and performing ahead of our expectations at each of our hyperscaler partners. As we outlined on previous calls, we expect the headwinds from subscription services to lessen over the course of FY25, allowing the strength of first party and marketplace storage services to shine through. Our rapid innovation in cloud storage services, broadening workload support, capabilities, price and performance points, continues to solidify our leadership position. In Q1, we again enhanced the capabilities of AWS FSx for NetApp ONTAP, boosting scalability and performance to address evolving business needs. Microsoft recognized the unique value we and CapGemini bring with its 2024 Partner of the Year award in the \u201cMigration to Azure\u201d category for our work in moving a large Asian retail customer to Azure, which included Azure NetApp Files. Our strong Q1 performance continues the momentum from last year, paving a confident path into FY25. The robust growth in our revenue, billings, and profitability reflects the increasing alignment of customer needs with our unique solutions. We believe our highly differentiated intelligent data infrastructure platform, designed for the age of data, positions us to capture the growth potential in flash, block, cloud storage, and AI, promising continued success for our shareholders and customers. Looking ahead, our priorities are clear. We are well positioned to seize a growing market opportunity. As we grow, we will maintain our disciplined operational management to drive leverage throughout our business model. In closing, I want to thank the NetApp team for their dedication to delivering exceptional results in an uncertain macro environment. I also want to remind you that we are hosting our INSIGHT customer conference in Las Vegas next month, where we will announce advances to our innovation agenda and showcase how we help our customers make their data infrastructure intelligent for the age of AI. I hope to see you there. Before I turn the call over to Mike, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve already seen the news of his upcoming retirement. Mike has been a great partner to me in our focus on delivering profitable growth and shareholder value. Over the course of his tenure from FY21 through FY24, he has helped drive revenue growth of 9% and EPS growth of almost 60%. In Mike, I have been blessed to have a wise partner from whom I learn much every day, a world-class human being whose trusted friendship has helped us navigate disruptions smoothly, and who has entertained us with his encyclopedic knowledge of country music. I appreciate Mike\u2019s commitment to stay through the end of the fiscal year to ensure a seamless transition. Over to you, Mike. Mike Berry : Thanks, George, I greatly appreciate the very nice comments. I\u2019ll come back to those comments after I run through the numbers. While my family and I are excited about what is to come in our next phase of life, I want to assure everyone that it is business as usual until we name a new CFO. My focus will remain on delivering our plans for this year and ensuring a smooth, seamless transition. We executed a solid quarter in an uncertain macro environment, hitting or exceeding all our guidance ranges. We are delivering on our commitments, as evident in our solid Q1 results. We made progress towards our long-term investor day targets of mid-to-upper single digit revenue and double-digit EPS growth on average through fiscal year 27. Before I get into the financial details, let me walk you through the key themes for the quarter. As a reminder, all numbers discussed are non-GAAP unless otherwise noted. Our top-line billings and revenue exceeded our expectations, growing 12% and 8% year-over-year respectively in Q1, with product revenue growing 13% year-over-year. As expected, Q1 consolidated gross margin was strong at 72%, near all-time highs. Gross margin leverage and operating discipline drove operating margin of 26% and EPS of $1.56, both Q1 records. We returned approximately 170% of free cash flow to stockholders through cash dividends and share repurchases, reducing Q1 diluted share count by 2% year-over-year. As we discussed during last quarter's call, we intend to return up to 100% of free cash flow this year. Due to our solid execution and strong operational management, we outperformed our expectations in the first quarter and expect our continued focus and discipline to deliver year-over-year revenue growth in each quarter of the year. As a result, we are raising our fiscal year 25 revenue and EPS expectations. Now, to the details of the quarter. Revenue of $1.54 billion increased 8% year-over-year, above the midpoint of our guidance range. Q1 billings of $1.45 billion increased 12% year-over-year. This marks our third straight quarter of year-over-year revenue and billings growth, even with an uncertain macro environment continuing to pressure IT spending. We are well aligned to customers' priority investments and remain confident that our innovations will drive growth through the rest of fiscal year 25. Product revenue of $669 million was up 13% year-over-year. Support revenue of $631 million grew 3% year-over-year. Public Cloud revenue of $159 million increased 3% from Q1 a year ago, driven by hyperscaler first party and marketplace storage services, offset by expected declines in subscription services. Q1 consolidated gross margin came in at 72% and was up 160 basis points from a year ago. Product gross margin was 60%, in line with expectations. As we discussed on the Q4 call and during the subsequent investor day, we have an increasing share of total revenue derived from higher margin and recurring revenue sources, which we expect to continue through fiscal year 2025. We have made strategic purchase commitments to lock-in SSD supply and mitigate rising prices in the future, which continues to give us confidence in our product gross margins for fiscal year 2025. Our recurring support business continues to be highly profitable with gross margins of 92%. Q1 Public Cloud gross margins improved to 71% from 68% in the prior fiscal year 2024 fourth quarter. During fiscal year 2025, we expect to continue to make progress on our Public Cloud gross margins towards our long-term target of 75% to 80%. Operating expenses of $714 million was up 2% year-over-year and declined 1% from Q4 fiscal year 2024. Q1 again highlighted the strength of our business model and disciplined operational execution with operating margin of 26%, ahead of expectations. EPS of $1.56 was also above the high end of our guidance, driven by higher revenues, operating margins, and interest income, and a slightly lower tax rate. Operating cash flow was $341 million in Q1, a decrease of 25% year-over-year, driven by higher annual incentive compensation payouts and payments for strategic SSD purchases, partially offset by higher customer collections from higher billings. In Q1, DSO decreased to 40 and inventory turns were 8. Free cash flow decreased 28% year-over-year to $300 million due to lower operating cash flow. During the quarter, we returned $507 million to stockholders through share repurchases and cash dividends, ending the quarter with approximately $600 million in net cash. We have approximately $1 billion remaining on our existing repurchase authorization. Our balance sheet remains healthy. We ended the quarter with approximately $3 billion in cash and short-term investments. Q1 deferred revenue was $4.2 billion, down less than half a percent year-over-year, a smaller decline than in each of the past three quarters. We expect continued improvement in our deferred revenue growth during fiscal year 2025 as we drive billings growth. We are adding RPO as a new disclosure this quarter as it is a leading indicator of future growth in our business. Keystone, our storage-as-a-service offering, continues to gain traction in the market, broadening our relevance to customer use cases and is becoming a more meaningful part of our business. RPO, which includes unbilled commitments, was $4.5 billion in Q1. Now turning to guidance, starting with the full year. While we continue to believe that macro indicators are uncertain, our continued execution gives us confidence in our business going forward. To that end, we are raising our revenue guidance for the full year to between $6.48 billion and $6.68 billion in revenue, representing 5% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. We expect fiscal year 2025 consolidated gross margin to be 71% to 72% and our operating margin to be 27% to 28%, both unchanged from prior expectations. We are raising our net interest income expectations to $50 million, driven by higher interest income. We now expect our tax rate for the full year to be 20% to 21%. As a result, we expect EPS to be in the range of $7 to $7.20, which at the midpoint, implies 10% year-over-year growth. Turning now to our second quarter guidance. We expect Q2 revenue to range between $1.565 billion and $1.715 billion, which at the midpoint, implies 5% growth year-over-year. We expect Q2 consolidated gross margin to be 71% to 72%, and operating margin to be approximately 28%. We expect net interest income to be approximately $15 million in the quarter, our tax rate to be between 20% and 21%, and EPS in the range of $1.73 to $1.83. In closing, I want to thank our employees, customers and investors for their commitment and investment in NetApp. I am confident in our ability to help our customers successfully achieve their digital and cloud transformation goals. We are well aligned to priority IT investments and are committed to deliver sustainable, long-term value for our stockholders. Finally, before we go on to Q&A, I would like to add some personal comments on my announcement. It has been an honor and a privilege to lead such a dynamic and visionary organization over the last four and a half years. I'm so proud to be part of the NetApp team and being able to play a role in helping NetApp grow and deliver on its promise of profitable growth. I am committed to ensuring a smooth transition and will continue to lead the finance organization until an appropriate successor is identified. Like all companies, NetApp continues to evolve, and I am excited to welcome a new CFO who will help take NetApp to the next level and execute against the strategic roadmap we laid out at our recent investor day. I want to thank all of you for your continued support of NetApp and look forward to the continued success in the business. That being said, I want to reiterate that it is business as usual for now and I look forward to seeing many of you at our upcoming investor events. Kris, please take it away for Q&A Kris Newton : Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen. Please go ahead. Krish Sankar : Hi, thanks for taking my question. And congrats on the strong results. And Mike, congrats on the retirement and thanks for all your help towards the sell side and the buy side, we're going to miss you. And my first question is for Mike on the higher NAND pricing, from a demand or top line standpoint, is that impacting the demand for all-flash? And from a cost standpoint, how to think about its impact on gross margins. Because I understand you made the strategic NAND purchases, but how many quarters do you think that lower NAND price purchase can carry you through? And then I had a follow up for George. Mike Berry : Sure. Hey Kris, thanks for the question and thank you for the kind comments. I appreciate it. So let's do the last one first. So as we've talked about, we've purchased a large majority of our NAND forecasted for fiscal 2025. We feel really good about the position that we're in there. How much of it may go into next year really depends on what happens in the rest of 2025 plus, we'll keep our eye on the market. We may decide to do more pre-buys. We'll see how the market goes. Back to your first question, if I understand it correctly, is, hey, I don't at this point, as we've always talked about, customers budget in dollars and from our standpoint, the market really hasn't changed too much. So we have not seen much of a change in demand. Based on that, we'll see how it goes for the rest of fiscal 2025. But up to this point, no real changes. Krish Sankar : Got it. Got it. Thanks Mike. And then George, quick question for you. Earlier this year you released the ASA series. It's like a great product as it unifies file block and object storage for customers. Can you just update us how is the product performing? And I understand new products take a while to translate into sales. How is the order flow pipeline looking like? And any kind of customer pushback for using a unified product versus their best of breed solution. Any feedback on that would be helpful. Thank you. George. George Kurian : We have been very pleased with the introduction of the AFF A series, which is the unified storage product line like you talked about. We introduced a set of models at the high end of those of the product family and the adoption rates have been strong. As you note, they go through a certification process and in the largest customers that takes a little while, but we're seeing all the right activity in terms of proof-of-concepts, qualifications and certifications underway. We've had several wins in customers that are deploying new environments that would be happy to choose a new product. It complements the C-series unified storage products. The C-series is for general purpose workloads. The A-series is for high performance, demanding workloads like transactional databases, AI workloads that demand low latency consistently, and a lot of IO. And both of those in turn complement the block optimized ASA family, which serves only block workloads where we also strong uptick. So I'm very pleased. Overall, our flash business performed really, really well in the quarter, as you saw, with 21% year-on-year growth. Krish Sankar : Thanks, George. Operator : Our next question comes from Samik Chatterjee with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Samik Chatterjee : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. And before I ask my question again, Mike, thanks for working with us so closely, and I know there's some time, but it was great working with you. Best of luck as well. I guess. If I can start with a question, George, I had more of a question on the comments that you had related to uncertain macro and how that's impacting storage demand. Because when I look at the progression of revenue here, which you've been doing a great job on, sort of executing to plan, the sequential trends are pretty much in line with seasonality that you've seen historically. It does look customers are back to spending in a more sort of normal fashion. So when you think about how the uncertain macro is impacting your customer\u2019s appetite to spend, what are you really seeing in terms of what would even concern you? Because you're on track to do record revenue at this point, trends look pretty sequential in line with seasonality. So just curious, like what is the, what are you seeing in terms of your customers appetite to spend in a normal fashion? Is there anything that's giving you some hesitation on that front? And I have a follow up. Thank you. Mike Berry : Yes. Overall, I think there are, while the economy has progressed from this time a year ago, there are still a good amount of geopolitical risks and we are waiting the interest rate changes that seem to be nearer than they were when we entered the quarter. So I feel like overall things are progressing in the right way, though there is still a good amount of, especially geopolitical uncertainty. With regard to what we saw in the quarter. We saw a broad based strength in our product lines and in the Asia PAC and European markets where our teams did really well. We saw some slowness in the U.S. public sector, especially the federal part of the public sector business because of the continued budget challenges. With the continuing resolution. U.S. enterprise performed well. What we see across all these markets is that customers are prioritizing spend on strategic projects and so that part of our business continues to do really well. And I'm encouraged by the alignment of our solutions to that. What we haven't yet seen is large scale data center refreshes which would signal a broader base economic recovery and confidence in the business. Samik Chatterjee : Got it. Got it. And in terms of when you talk about AI workloads and you talk about sort of AI is truly going to be more of a hybrid sort of environment, play with both public cloud and sort of your hybrid solutions. And you talked about in the prepared remarks ASA driving some of those wins as well. How do you think about fiscal 2025 in the context of what contribution you're expecting from these wins that are more specific to customers saying these are going to be dedicated towards their AI deployments or AI workloads, both covering sort of public cloud and hybrid. How you're thinking about what that looks like for your fiscal year. Thank you. Mike Berry : Yes, let me hit on, you had two points in there. One is, I think, broadly speaking, the rate of innovation in the software applications that drive AI is very high, particularly in the public cloud, where broader frameworks that combine databases, data warehouses, data lakes, together with AI models are progressing at a really rapid rate. So what we see within our customers is many of them want to use the tools on the public cloud, the applications together with data that might sit in their data center environments or in the public cloud. And we are able to make that entire workflow much, much more secure and easy to manage, which is a part of the reason why we saw strength both in the data foundation for AI as well as in the cloud storage portfolio, where we're seeing our ability to create a no siloed, unified architecture come through for us. With regard to how we see it play out through the year. Listen, on Cloud, we have said that we've seen strong results for multiple quarters now with our cloud storage portfolio. Those have been masked by some of the challenges we have noted, and that we are seeing lessening as a headwind from the subscription part of our business. So we expect cloud to return to a pattern of consistent growth through the rest of the year. With regard to the storage portfolio, listen, we're one quarter into the year, we had a really, really strong flash quarter. I'm encouraged we've raised guidance for the full year. We are very, very confident heading to the rest of the year and we'll tell you more as the year plays out. Samik Chatterjee : Okay, great. Thank you. Thanks for the responses. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Simon Leopold with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Victor [ph] chew in for Simon. Can you just provide some color around the sequential improvement in public cloud this quarter? What was the driver behind the strike there? And how should we think about the sustainability trajectory of the improvement from this point going forward? Mike Berry : Hey, Victor, it's Mike. Sure happy to do that. So, as George talked about in his remarks, we saw really strong growth in our first party and marketplace cloud storage business. We talked a lot about that at our investor day in terms of that growth. So that grew 40% year-over-year. If you take a look at the rest of the portfolio, as he talked about as well. Hey, we are expecting subscription services to still be a little bit of a headwind, though, moderating as we go through the year. So all-in-all, we do expect cloud revenue to accelerate from a growth perspective as we go through the year, led by the strength in first party and marketplace, and also the subscription services being a little bit less of a headwind as we get through some of those business changes that we are making. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, so the strength is kind of largely in line with what you were expecting. Mike Berry : For the most part, it was cloud and first party marketplace were what we were expecting, and even a little bit better, quite frankly. So we've seen some really nice growth in that business. And again, as we look forward, we expect that to continue and actually accelerate because of the strength of those products. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, that's helpful. And just one quick follow up. How should we think about the last question? How should we think about the mix of the type of customers behind the initial AI contributions? Are you seeing demand from enterprises, or, or is it biased towards kind of a hyperscale cloud type operators? How do we think about where the demand is coming from initially and how that evolves over time as the type of AI workloads evolve? Mike Berry : Most of our demand is from large enterprises, some of which operate as internal service providers, but most of the demand is from very large enterprises. There is a mix of use cases across data lakes and data foundations for AI fine tuning and model training, as well as the first phases of inferencing rag. So we've seen a good blend of all of those use cases. Unidentified Analyst : That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Steven Fox with Fox Advisors. Please go ahead. Steven Fox : Hi. Good afternoon. And Mike, congrats on your retirement? I guess just in terms of thinking about competitive dynamics, George, it seems like you called out, like you mentioned, a broad set of sort of positives that could be winning market share. Can you sort of give us a sense versus now versus 90 days ago where you were, you're seeing the most gains and why, and I where maybe you're more confident going forward on share gains. Thanks a lot. George Kurian : Listen, I think what we've seen is our focus and execution continues to get better and better, and we made good progress on that in the second half of last year, and then that momentum continues. So I feel really, really good about where we are. With regard to the portfolio, our cloud storage portfolio continues to gain traction. Right. We've got more workloads, more price points, more customers, and integration into a broader and broader set of the hyperscalers environment. So I feel really, really good about the innovation portfolio there. With regard to the flash portfolio, really strong results across the board. We had in the block storage part of that portfolio, which is pure share gain against competition. We are demonstrating the price performance leadership against the high end product of our competitors, as well as the price performance and feature set leadership against the mid-range products of our competitors. So I feel really good about the wins that we're seeing across the board. Thank you. Steven Fox : Thank you. Operator : Next question comes from Amit Daryanani with Evercore. Please go ahead. Amit Daryanani : Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for being my question. I have two as well. I guess, George, maybe to start with, you folks are seeing some really good growth on the all-flash array side. I think it's up 21% this quarter. Can you just talk about, is this cyclical recovery in demand, or is it share gains or you just converting your install base, perhaps more towards all-flash? Just trying to understand what's driving the strength here. And then crucially, what do you think the durability of this 20% plus growth is on the all-flash side as you go forward? George Kurian : This is the third successive quarter of high rates of all-flash growth, double digits. And we feel really good about the portfolio. Just let me hit a couple of the points you raised, which is we are seeing a broad set of new to NetApp customers and new to NetApp flash customers with the broaden portfolio that we have roughly 50 :50 mix of completely new to NetApp have never had NetApp, as well as a broad set of customers who are buying our flash products for the first time. So I feel that's a good leading indicator of continued momentum in the portfolio. With regard to the installed base getting upgraded, we have said that a part of the cycle of QLC flash is the refresh or the migration of a very, very large 10K install base of hard drives, both ours as well as our competitors to that flash product portfolio. And so it's a mix of new accounts, new to NetApp Flash accounts, as well as some of the install base getting refreshed. And I think if you just look at it right, the total installed base of 10K drives is enormous. It was roughly, from a volume perspective, somewhere around 35% to 40% of the total storage market for a very long period of time. And so there's a huge install base to go refresh. So if you ask me, we are in the second inning of a nine in ballgame. Amit Daryanani : Perfect. George Kurian : And you know what? In terms of our one final comment, the strength of our customer additions says that even with all of the growth of our flash, the overall installed base grew so that the penetration of flash into our installed base stayed steady, quarter-on-quarter. Amit Daryanani : Got it. That's really helpful, George. And then Mike, Alex and Mike, congrats as well on your retirement. Could you just maybe, just touch on how should we think about product gross margins from the 60% zip code that you had in Q1, really, for the rest of the fiscal year? Just maybe any parameters on how to think about product gross margin we go through the year would be helpful. Thank you. Mike Berry : Sure. And Amit and everybody, thanks for the comments. I appreciate it. We got a lot of work to do. You're going to see me for a little while, so I do appreciate it. On product gross margins, as we said last quarter, we do expect it to come down a little bit as we go through the quarter as we work down the pre buys. So we were right about at 60% this quarter. Again, we said for the full year that as we sit here today, we're still comfortable with that upper 50s to 60 for the full year basis. So no real change on it in the trajectory of what we expect through the rest of the year that we anything different than we talked about last quarter. George Kurian : If I were to just add, during the course of the quarter, we saw, as we see in the history of the storage industry, some of our competitors did take pricing up. And so that's a leading indicator of actions that the broader industry would take in an inflationary commodity environment. Amit Daryanani : Great. Thank you very much. George Kurian : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Mehdi Hosseini with SIG. Please go ahead. Mehdi Hosseini : Yes, excuse me. Thanks for taking the question. I want to go back to George's commentary you talked about, or flash array record 3400, actually year-over-year growth of 21%, another record. But George, consistent with the prior question, every time we get to this kind of 20% plus growth, the concern is, okay, when is it going to decelerate? And I understand that you laid out your targets for FY 2027, but could we see a deceleration in FY 2026, especially if overall spending environment were to remain constrained and then a more broader upgrade cycle would come in, in FY 2027, could we see that kind of a cycle materializing? Because given what we have seen over the past 20 years, every time you had this kind of a strong growth, it's followed by deceleration. I want to understand what gives the confidence, and I have a follow up. George Kurian : I think two or three things, right. I think one is portfolio is a lot broader than what we've had in the past. And I would point that out by the fact that we now have flash products across all the price points in the market, as well as custom offerings for block storage, where we previously would only sell unified storage. And so I feel really good about having a much fuller product portfolio, as well as the pace of innovation and leadership that we have in areas like data security is pretty clearly underwritten in the market. The second is where we are today is in a market where the pure play storage players are outperforming the integrated system vendors. And so you look at a broad range of the integrated system vendors, they have struggled now for many quarters in their storage business, and it remains to be seen whether that is a strategic focus for them going forward. And so when I look at our position relative to other players in the market. I feel really good. I would not call the current environment a rosy spending environment. Right. And we have done well for multiple quarters now in a fairly choppy macroeconomic environment. I'm hopeful that if the macro stabilizes, especially the geopolitical environment stabilizes, we should see some more spending come through which would be benefit to our business. Mehdi Hosseini : Thank you. Thanks for additional insight to a repeat question and just one quick follow up for me. How should I think about the mix of NAND that they're using in terms of QLC versus other technology, and how the QLC mix would trend over the next couple of quarters? George Kurian : QLC should grow as a percentage of our total mix. It's roughly half right now as a percentage of the flash business, and so you should see that grow as a percentage of the total flash business. Mehdi Hosseini : Great. Thank you. And Mike, best of luck with you in your next endeavor. Mike Berry : Thank you, Mehdi. Operator : Our next question comes from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, this is Jake [ph] on for Aaron. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for the question. I was just hoping you could double click a little bit on the enterprise demand you're seeing for AI products. It sounds like it's still pretty early days for AI inference and wondering what ending of adoption you think we're in and what's the competitive landscape like there. George Kurian : Yes, I think we are in the early innings of the AI landscape. From a storage perspective, I think you are seeing the fact that AI, so far, the AI applications requires a specific computing architecture, which is why you're seeing the compute build out happening. But from a storage and data standpoint, people are using their proprietary data with these AI models. And so, as we've said consistently, we're in the early innings. It is when that inferencing trend, as well as large scale generation of data come into play that you'll really see the inflection in data storage. I think what we are seeing right now is everybody is getting their data ready for AI, and so they're all trying to unify their data, figure out what data they need for particular types of applications, getting their hybrid cloud pipelines working so that they have AI applications in the cloud, they can connect their data to it. And so we're seeing a lot of getting data ready, which is often in the form of a data lake or some kind of data infrastructure that brings together all of their data, and we're very well positioned for that. We hold a huge amount of the unstructured data in the world, and so we are naturally a part of any generative AI use case requires data that often sits on us. And the two examples we gave you on the earnings call are classic examples. One's a large financial services institution that is trying to summarize all of the unstructured data that they have in their various applications. And so they work with us and a set of AI application vendors to feed all of that into their LLMs. We are expecting, inferencing is expected to be the preponderant majority of the storage market for AI and the enterprise AI landscapes. It's about 80%, maybe 90% of the total market. And RAG is expected to generate about 8x more data than the data that is fed into the RAG pipeline. So there's a lot of new generation going to happen when and if these applications become mainstream. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital. Please go ahead. Ananda Baruah : Hey, yes, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking the question. And Mike, congratulations. We'll miss working with you, but job well done, obviously. I guess. George, stick him right there. I just have one. Stick him right there. Piggybacking up analyst day. So inferencing is 80% to 90% of the storage market opportunity over time. Can you, the comments you made about RAG a moment ago and the growth there, the data getting thrown out there, like, how does that, I guess, is that like in the other 10% of the opportunity, or does that actually in some way feed and amplify the inferencing opportunity. And then can you just remind us, you just mentioned access to data install base that you guys have. But can you also remind us from a capability perspective, how you stack up to the other companies that could have a place in, say, inferencing and RAG? And then also, could you include your thoughts on how, how you stack up relative to, say, [Indiscernible] and DDN just to level set that for us. Thanks. Mike Berry : Yes. So let me hit, there's three questions in there. On the first one, the comment about where do we see the large multiplicative effect of RAG and vectorization of data. It is actually part of the inferencing data growth. We see that when you create structure on top of unstructured data for inferencing, it actually grows the amount of data that you store quite significantly. And so that fits into that opportunity set that we say, hey, 80% of it is probably inferencing. With regard to our capability set. Listen, we feel really, really good about our capability set. I think what we see is, first of all, we have a lot of experience in AI. We've been in the market since 2018. With Nvidia we have hundreds of customers that do AI with us. The second is to do this kind of large scale AI workloads, you need to have scale out file systems and integrated object. And so the fact that we have an ONTAP, a scaled out file system with parallel NFS and integrated S3 [ph] capabilities gives us a lot of strength in the market. We've got wins in training, we've got wins in data lakes, we've got wins in fine tuning and inferencing. So pretty much across the board. We are also unique in the market with the hybrid cloud pipelines. Right? There is no one else in the market that can do what we do, literally no one else, because of the native integration that we have. And I would just close by saying come to NetApp Insight. We have an awesome set of innovations that will showcase how real customers are using our technology to solve real AI problems today and over the next twelve months. We got an awesome set of capabilities that build on all the hard work we've done so far. Ananda Baruah : That's super helpful. I'm going to just do a quick follow up. Does this mean just given all the capabilities you spoke about, George, does that suggest that you believe the company could have an amplified share position in GenAI storage when that kicks in? George Kurian : With GenAI, the two market players that have the installed base, Dell and us, are super well positioned. We feel extraordinarily good about our capabilities that come to insight. You'll hear more. Ananda Baruah : Thanks a lot. Appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Wamsi Mohan : Yes, thank you so much for taking the question. George, you just said that you had an all-flash new to NetApp and new to all-flash. Can you just elaborate a little bit what parts of the all-flash market are you seeing the most traction between hybrid capacity and performance flash? And who do you think you're taking the most share from? And I have a follow up. George Kurian : I think if you look at the overall market, the capacity flash market is the fastest growing. It is because the technology is new, you are seeing the displacement of 10K drives and it's all year-on-year compares the capacity flash market as tailwinds. And I think that's where we see the strongest growth. The performance flash market continues to be a growing part of the business. We have done well there and I feel good about the prospects for our performance flash block products, which are a tam expanding opportunity for us. We compete in that part of the market against frame arrays. It could be the Dell power Max or a large frame array from Hitachi or HPE. And essentially the capability that we have is exceptional price performance, consistent latency, which makes it easy to run databases and other workloads on our infrastructure, plus a great set of features that allow you to unify your data landscape and take these environments and plug them into the AI workflows that you want. And so I feel good about that on the high end. We have also seen good progress in the mid-range with QLC against a broad range. Upgrading our install base of 10K drive, upgrading other installed bases of 10K drives. And so, same suspects we compete with. Our results are strong and so I feel good about the fact that we've taken share in the market. Wamsi Mohan : Okay, thanks, George. And one from Mike. Mike, congrats as well. Can you talk about the drivers for the lower tax rate? And if you look at the higher interest income and lower tax rate, it does not show much increase at the operational level for operating dollars, despite the higher, slightly higher revenue. So just wondering what some of the puts and takes there. If there are anything that you'd like to call out. And are you still expecting gross margins to step down a little in the second half versus first half or does that change now because you have these pre buys that you've made during the quarter? Thank you. Mike Berry : So thank you, Wamsi. Thanks for the question. So I'm going to answer the last one first and then just give me the chance to walk through the puts and takes of guidance. The answer is no. No change to what we said last time in terms of the trajectory of gross margin. So, hey, let's back up for a second. So we beat the first quarter by 11 million in revenue and 11 million in EPS because of the strength in the business and our confidence in it. We then raised it by 30 million in revenue and then $0.20 in EPS. Let's go left to right first, and then we're going to go down, because I think this is important. So based on those results and the demand that we see in the visibility into Q2, we did raise Q2 by about another 10 million. We also raised the second half in revenue as well. EPS largely follows that as you go through the year. However, we did underspend in OpEx in the first quarter. Therefore, we pushed some of that spend in the second half. That answers your question about why you don't see the operational, the throughput as much. And then let's hit your other questions. On the tax rate, it is simply a forecast of projection of income by GEO. Our tax rate in the last two years has been 20.9% 20.3%. We thought it would go up based on the mix of profitability, we now expect it to be consistent with last year. And then on the interest income the team has done a lot of great work making sure that we can invest all of our cash balances. And candidly, they didn't lower rates as fast as we thought they might. Hence we've bumped that number up as well. So those are the big movers in guidance. And then for the year we've left. Importantly, the full year gross margin percentage and operating income percentage is consistent. We're only one quarter in. We feel really good about the year, but let us get through the next quarter and then we'll take a look at that as we go through the year. So hopefully that helps. That's the outline for guidance for the year, Wamsi. Wamsi Mohan : Yes, thank you so much, Mike. Operator : Our final question today comes from David Vogt with UBS. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, thanks for taking the question. This is Brian [ph] on for David. I'm just wondering, on GenAI, is flash at a TCO today to drive adoption of storage, or do we need the cost curve to come down further over the next year or so? And then what percentage of shipments and installed base are flash today? Thank you. George Kurian : With regard to shipments, flash is, if you look at it, roughly 60% of the hybrid cloud revenue. And so it's a little bit higher than that on product revenue. So I would just leave it there. I think with regard to the install base, it's still a small part of the total installed base. The majority is, it's about 40%. The majority is still hard drives. And we've been selling flash for how many years? So it shows the size and the fact that our overall installed base is growing. Let me get to your question about AI. With regard to AI, it depends on what part of the lifecycle you're operating in. If you are building a large repository of data, like a data lake, where you're unifying all the different data types that you want to be able to process in a large language model, the portion of that data that is actively being used with the model is going to be on flash. The sort of a practical customer that doesn't want to gold plate their environment will keep the archive data sets for models that they have run for either regulatory reasons or for business trajectory reasons. They will keep that on disk based solutions is what we've seen so far. Large scale object repositories that are typically on kind of disk based solutions. If you then move into active model training and fine tuning, that happens in an all flash configuration where the active data set is being crunched with an LLM, and then when you move to an inferencing model, inferencing happens wherever you have your business process. Right. So you could have it in a data center environment where you could run it on flash, you could have it in a small manufacturing facility where you could probably use disk or flash, and then you could also have it in the cloud. We are seeing many instances of cloud based inferencing that our tools are being used. So it's a broad mixed. I hope that gave you. There's no one answer. I hope that gave you a good sense of where the business is at. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. Kris Newton : All right, thank you, Brian. I'm going to pass it back to George for some closing remarks. George Kurian : Thank you, Kris. And thanks everyone. We have got FY 2025 off to a strong start because of the strong alignment of our solutions with customer\u2019s most important data challenges, coupled with our focused execution. We are delivering innovation at a fast pace and are well positioned to capture the growth potential in the key markets of flash, block, cloud storage and AI. Our relentless focus on these significant opportunities, combined with disciplined operational management continues to yield positive outcomes. I hope to see you at NetApp Insight and look forward to updating you on our continued progress on next quarter's call. Thank you. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
