[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Cindy Holmes, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Cindy Holmes : Thank you, Colby. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.  Both our first quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.  We are hopeful that you can join us for our 2013 investor conference to be held in New York in October. We will provide details later this year and look forward to seeing many of you then. I will now turn the call over to Dave Dillon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kroger. David Dillon : Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's first quarter 2013 results are Rodney McMullen, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. The year is off to a great start. In the first quarter, we achieved strong sales and record earnings per share. In our investor conference last October, we outlined our long-term strategy and strategic and capital investment plans, which included expanding into new markets and adding square footage in markets where we currently operate. Based upon these plans, our positive identical store sales growth for the last 9 years plus, and our strong earnings per share results in 2011 and 2012, we raised our long-term earnings per share growth rate guidance to 8% to 11% plus an increasing dividend. These first quarter results give us continued confidence that we will achieve our long-term guidance again this year. Our ability to achieve earnings per share growth of this magnitude puts Kroger in an exclusive class of companies capable of delivering...  [Technical Difficulty] I'm sure we're live. Are we back on? We must be. Okay, so let me continue. Our ability to achieve earnings per share growth of this magnitude puts Kroger in an exclusive class of companies capable of delivering this level of growth on a consistent basis. I am very proud of our associates for delivering another quarter of inspired Customer 1st performance. We're connecting with our customers better than ever before, and their positive view of Kroger continues to improve. Our associates also did an outstanding job of keeping costs down this quarter. We continue to find our cost savings in places that do not negatively impact our customer shopping experience so that we can reinvest those savings in ways that create lasting customer loyalty. As a result of this cycle, we achieved our 38th consecutive quarter of positive identical store sales growth. Our solid operating performance continues to support our plans to increase capital investment to grow our business over time. We continue to monitor how 4 factors are affecting consumer confidence : the overall state of the economy, fluctuating gas prices, payroll taxes and government policy uncertainty. While there are signs of a better economy, the improvement is not robust. Customer sentiment is gradually improving but remains fragile. We continue to see high variability in sales comparisons between days and weeks. Overall, we are confident that we will meet the targets we committed to in October, both now and in the future. We've raised our fiscal 2013 earnings per share guidance to reflect this confidence. Rodney will now provide additional details about our first quarter business performance. Rodney? W. McMullen: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results demonstrate the progress we are making on our long-term growth strategy. We continue to narrow our focus on new markets for future expansion and to add square footage in several fill-in markets. Fort Wayne, Indiana is a good example of where we've done this successfully. Over the last several years, we've upgraded our position in the market by investing in new stores and remodels, completing an acquisition and making incremental investments in our people through training and leadership development. As a result, we have doubled our market share in Fort Wayne over the last 5 years. We view this as a successful pilot and are well underway with similar strategies in several other markets. A key growth metric of our business is identical sales because it provides the best measure of our growing relevance with customers over time. We are very pleased with our first quarter identical supermarket sales growth of 3.3% without fuel. This is even better when you look at identical sales without fuel and pharmacy. On this basis, our identical sales grew to 4% versus 3.2% on a comparable basis last year. Sales growth in the first quarter was driven by loyal household growth, more visits per household and increases in prices per unit. In addition to visiting our stores more frequently, customers continue to buy more on a monthly basis. Items per basket were slightly up on a per trip basis and a monthly basis. As a result, total units sold was up solidly compared to last year. During the first quarter, we grew the number of loyal households in all divisions. Our loyal household growth count grew at a much faster rate than total household growth, which was also up for the quarter. The product cost inflation is estimated at 1.7%, excluding fuel. Every store department had inflation, with the exception of seafood, which had deflation. Our pharmacy business has undergone a lot of change in the last 18 months, and we are thrilled with where we are. The amount of Express Scripts volume that we have -- the amount of Express Scripts volume we retained. As expected, the effect of generics continued in the first quarter, which I described earlier, affected identical sales by 70 basis points. Even with these headwinds, our pharmacy team continues to deliver outstanding performance, including solidly positive script count growth. I want to echo Dave's earlier comment that our associates did a great job controlling costs in the first quarter. OG&A costs plus rent and depreciation, without fuel, were down 21 basis points as a percent of sales. Now I'd like to update you on the progress in corporate brand. As we said last quarter, our practice had been to disclose our corporate brand share in the grocery category only. Given the breadth of our corporate brand offerings, we are now comfortable to give you a view of our share across the whole store, excluding fuel and pharmacy. On this broader basis, corporate brands represented approximately 26% of total units sold, up 30 basis points compared to the first quarter last year. Total corporate brand sales dollars were 23.7%, also up 30 basis points compared to the same period last year. We continue to see impressive growth in our Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic brands. We are regularly adding new items. In fact, we plan to launch 75 new items between now and the end of this year, and today, offer 450 honest, easy and affordable Simple Truth options for our customers. And by the way, they're great. We also continue to make progress to integrate sustainable practices into our everyday business operation. Next week, we will publish our seventh Annual Sustainability Report. As a preview, I'd like to highlight some of the -- our most successful initiatives of 2012. We have reduced total store energy usage by 32.7% since the year 2000. We also reduced our carbon footprint and made significant progress toward our goal of 0 waste. 21 of our 37 manufacturing plants have now achieved the impressive goal of sending 0 waste to landfills. I'd like to thank our associates for bringing all these initiatives to life through their individual actions each and every day. Their efforts are helping make each community we serve a better place to live. Finally, an update on labor relations. Our store associates ratified a series of new labor agreements, covering stores in Michigan, Houston, Indianapolis, plus Fred Meyer and QFC stores in Oregon. We have many contracts that have expired or will expire soon, including contracts in Roanoke, Seattle, and later this year in Cincinnati and Dallas. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive cost and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, have a shared objective. Growing Kroger's business and profitability will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for all of our associates. In fact, over the last 5 years, we've added 33,000 jobs.  Now Mike will provide more detail on Kroger's first quarter financial results and our guidance for the rest of the year. Mike? J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Total sales increased 3.4% to $30 billion in the first quarter compared with $29.1 billion for the same period last year. Total sales, excluding fuel, increased 3.8% in the first quarter over the same period last year. Net earnings for the first quarter totaled $481 million or $0.92 per diluted share. Net earnings for the first quarter of last year were $439 million or $0.78 per diluted share. Several factors contributed to this great result, including strong operations, lower LIFO expense, lower share count and partially offset by our higher effective tax rate this year. FIFO gross margin was 20.65% of sales for the first quarter. Excluding retail fuel operations, FIFO gross margin decreased 15 basis points from the same period last year. The company recorded a $17 million LIFO charge during the quarter compared to a $46 million LIFO charge in the same quarter last year. We were pleased to deliver on our goal to grow FIFO operating margin in the first quarter. First quarter FIFO operating profit, excluding fuel, increased approximately $47 million over the prior year. Excluding fuel and the extra week in fiscal 2012, on a rolling 4 quarters basis, FIFO operating margin increased 11 basis points. On a rolling 4 quarter 52-week basis, return on invested capital was 13.5% compared to 13.4% during the same period last year. We are committed to growing our ROIC over time, even with the higher level of capital spending. Turning now to retail fuel operations. We disclosed many items with and without fuel due to its effect on operating costs and gross rates, but we view fuel as a core department that, over time, is expected to contribute to earnings per share growth. About half of our supermarkets have fuel centers today. In the first quarter, our supermarket fuel centers margin per gallon was approximately $0.116 compared to $0.121 in the same quarter last year. As it relates to retails per gallon in all fuel outlets, they averaged $3.52 in this quarter compared to $3.65 last year. Total gallons sold showed solid growth. Our planned uses of cash remain unchanged : Maintain our current investment grade debt rating, repurchase shares, pay dividends to shareholders and fund capital investments. You will notice on our balance sheet that the current portion of long-term debt has increased, and our net total-debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio has declined to 1.85. As it relates to the current portion of long-term debt, we made the conscious decision to fund out our first quarter maturities using the historically low interest rates available in the commercial paper market. Since we have hedged the expected financings, our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates has been mitigated. The lower-than-expected net total-debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was primarily a result of our stock's recent performance, which took us out of the market for share repurchases based on the 10b5-1 we had [ph]  in place at the time. As you know, we modify our grid from time to time. We currently have $447 million remaining on our board authorization and believe that repurchases in the current range are attractive. During the first quarter, Kroger repurchased 4.5 million common shares for a total investment of $146 million. Kroger's strong financial position has allowed the company to return more than $1.3 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last 4 quarters. Capital investment totaled $646 million for the first quarter compared to $557 million for the same period last year. We continue to expect full-year capital investments to be in the $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion range. Now I'll update our growth objectives for fiscal 2013. Based on the first quarter results, we increased our net earnings guidance range to $2.73 to $2.80 per diluted share for the year. Our original guidance was $2.71 to $2.79 per diluted share. The company's long-term growth rate guidance is 8% to 11%, and shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend that we expect to grow over time. The calculation of our growth rate for fiscal 2013 is based on our fiscal 2012 adjusted earnings per share of $2.52, as was shown in Table 6 of the fourth quarter press release. Adjustments include the UFCW consolidated pension plan lability, the credit card settlement and the extra week. As you look at our expectations for the year, please keep in mind the guidance we gave in March for the fourth quarter. On a 12-week basis, we still expect this year's fourth quarter to be behind the fourth quarter last year. This is because we currently expect a $13 million LIFO charge in the fourth quarter this year compared to a credit of $41 million in the fourth quarter of last year. Kroger continues to expect identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of approximately 2.5% to 3.5% for fiscal year 2013. Now I will turn it back to Dave. David Dillon : Thank you, Mike. I understand that at the beginning of the call, several of you were not able to hear our opening comments. And so I know that a lot of the purpose of this call is to give you a sense of how we felt about the quarter. So I'm going to go back and repeat just a little bit of what I think you may have missed. The most important part you missed was the stunning oratory that Cindy offered of the forward-looking statement caution. But that, rather than read that you, I just want to you know that is posted online so you can find that there. But the other paragraph that you missed was my initial comments about how I felt about the quarter, and so I want to read those to you, they're important. I said that this year is off to a great start. And in the first quarter, we achieved strong sales and record earnings per share. In our investor conference this last October, we outlined our long-term strategy, our strategic and capital investment plans, which include expanding into new markets and adding square footage in markets where we currently operate. Based upon these plans, our positive identical sales growth for more than 9 years and our strong earnings per share results in 2011 and '12, we raised our long-term earnings per share growth rate guidance from 8% to 11%, plus an increasing dividend. These first quarter results that we're here to talk about today give us continued confidence that we will achieve our long-term earnings guidance again this year. Our ability to achieve earnings per share growth of this magnitude puts Kroger in an exclusive class of companies capable of delivering this level of growth on a consistent basis. So with that background, before I turn to questions, I want to close with these observations. I'm very proud of the Kroger team's relentless focus on delivering on our Customer 1st strategy quarter after quarter. It's what sets us apart from competition. Our customers' positive view of Kroger continues to improve, and they are rewarding us with their loyalty. We achieved strong sales and record earnings per share for the quarter, controlled costs and delivered on our goal to improve FIFO operating margin. The momentum coming out of the first quarter will continue to drive growth and greater shareholder value. So now we look forward to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : A couple of things. First, did the first quarter come in a little bit better than you guys had planned in light of sort of the quarterly breakdown Mike had given on the last call? If that's true, what may have driven the upside in your mind? And then I know on the last call, Mike, you'd also -- you'd talked about the second and third quarter being up toward the high end of your long-term range. Are those still about right or has anything changed there? J. Schlotman: Yes, the second and third quarter guidance would remain unchanged, and we didn't call that out in the prepared comments. I focused only on the fourth quarter. Just to make sure everybody remembered that's what we said about the fourth quarter. Relative to the first quarter, yes, it came out a little better than we expected. Sales were a little stronger than we had anticipated at the beginning of the year, so I would say it was primarily a sales-driven beat in the first quarter, and just as well was great execution at store level from a cost control standpoint as well. John Heinbockel : Okay. And then secondly, as you think about market share, maybe for Dave and Rodney, when you think about market share, and we give the Fort Wayne example, have you yet had a market, and I'm not sure if it would be Cincinnati or Denver or one of those, a market where you've not been able to increase share, you've hit a natural ceiling. And then when you think about the incremental margin attached to that, does that -- as you get to certain points of share, whether it be 30 or 35 or whatever, does the incremental margin sort of step up, up to a certain point and then flatten out, or how do you think about the economics of that? David Dillon : Well, I'm sure there's some point of diminishing returns, but I don't think we found it yet. And I think we're pleased that at any of the historical references we would have to look at market share, we're not going talk about specific markets in that regard, but we have plenty of examples, some of which you've already listed, that illustrate well how that strategy will work. Rodney, you want to add anything to that? W. McMullen: The only thing I would add is one of the things that we continue to expand some of the things we offer in a market, too. So if you look at the core grocery business, you may start getting a cap there or a diminishing return. But one of the things that we've had, and we've had very good results that help our return on investment, is expanding some of the things we're offering. So in some of the markets that you gave examples of, if you look at our marketplace store, we're finding we are getting good returns by expanding what we offer to the customer. David Dillon : That's a really good point because it is a dynamic marketplace, and things will change over time, and even when you think you've hit a peak, you just push yourself to find additional either products or services or remodel the stores or approach the stores differently. It's just a dynamic place. W. McMullen: And we do -- every time we do an investment project, we look at the incremental effect that it has on surrounding stores to make sure that their incremental return is there. And so it becomes store specific on each individual investment decision. John Heinbockel : Okay. But I guess you haven't hit a peak yet in share as far as you can tell in any market, right? W. McMullen: Not that we can tell. David Dillon : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays. Meredith Adler : I would like to just understand a little bit your sales guidance. You're still maintaining the 2.5% to 3.5%, although you hit close to the high end. And I would have thought that generics would have been a particularly negative impact on the first quarter, probably even through the whole first half, and then I think fuel prices were down a little bit. So are you being just very conservative, or is there something about sales for the next 3 quarters that make you believe that you'll stay no more than this range? W. McMullen: It's really just so early in the year, and it's just having 1/4 of the year over with. Obviously, so far, we're very pleased with our sales. We continue to strive to be in the top part of that range. We continue to strive to be there. But I would say the biggest thing is it's just early in the year, and it felt too early to change guidance on that given all the uncertainty that's going on in the marketplace. Meredith Adler : Okay, I understand that. I guess, I just would like to ask a little bit about inflation. 1.7% is not an excessively moderate number. I don't know what the trends have looked like. And a concern often is that if inflation gets to be moderate enough, some retailers could end up with negative comps, and you could see a heightening of the competitive environment. Are you seeing anything like that anywhere, or is there any reason to be concerned about that? David Dillon : Meredith, I'll have Mike maybe comment on inflation and then Rodney on the competitive environment. But the inflation we saw in the first quarter was very similar to what you saw in the fourth quarter. And while there's a little push and take in what department it fell in, it was very similar and quite moderate. So you want to comment on where you see inflation, anything else you want to add, Mike? J. Schlotman: No, I think inflation in the first quarter is about where we expected it to be, and it's essentially in line with what we baked in to our expectations for the year. W. McMullen: And certainly from a competitive standpoint, we don't see huge changes. As you know, we always try to make sure we stay flexible to deal with competitive changes as they happen. But so far, we haven't seen really any change going on. Meredith Adler : Okay, that's great. I guess my just one other question would be about your investments in new stores in maybe new markets or adjacent markets. Is there anything in terms of what's happening with competitors or the real estate market that make you feel better or worse about the ability to generate a good return from those new investments? David Dillon : I think the decision more rides upon our confidence in what we're doing. And I think it's somewhat independent. I mean, I suppose there's some outside factors that could cause you to go a different direction. But more than anything, it's really focused on what we do well and what we have confidence that we can continue to do well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Krueger. Edward Kelly : I'm with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Dave, could you discuss the cadence of your IDs throughout the quarter, what you're seeing so far in Q2 and how underlying -- I guess, underlying volume is probably the same since inflation is the same, but could you just give a little bit color there? David Dillon : Sure. I'll describe what I think I recall and Beth will correct me if I'm wrong because she's sitting here with me. But earlier in the quarter, let's say through the first half or even 2/3 of the way through the quarter was a little stronger than at the tail end of the quarter. But we still ended up happy and strong at the end of the quarter. And then so far, after 3.5 weeks, we've seen IDs without fuel to be very similar to what they were in the first quarter. W. McMullen: The other thing worth mentioning is just Easter. David Dillon : Yes, that's true. W. McMullen: The comment early in the quarter is certainly true. Then when you look midway through the quarter, it's a little harder to see because Easter was earlier this year than last year. So some of the cycling of the change in Easter also affected the cadence during the quarter. David Dillon : Yes, I think we -- I'd tell you the same caution I tell ourselves is don't try to overread it because -- the first quarter in particular, because of that Easter phenomenon. Every year, we're in this no man's land of trying to read, are you happy or not happy with your sales? And the week before Easter, the week after Easter and a few of the days surrounding either direction of that have a big impact on how you're going to feel. So I wouldn't overread it. Edward Kelly : Okay. My next question for you is on the gross margin. Historically, there seems, like our perception at least into the markets, is there has been more volatility in your gross margin quarter-to-quarter. Whereas you may see an opportunity to make an investment, it's probably hurt sort of investor perception of the company historically. But more recently, it felt a little bit more consistent. And I guess the question really is, has there been any change in the way you sort of think about running the company in terms of the investments that you're making in margin and the volatility around that in terms of you trying to take advantage of different opportunities? David Dillon : Well, I think you're well aware that we try to look at this on an annual basis. However, we have also tried to be a little more consistent and conscious of the way in which a quarter might appear, so that we don't end up doing something abrupt in 1 quarter and wishing we hadn't done that, and then the next quarter have to go the other direction. So we have been a little bit more careful ourselves. We also have learned a little bit better how to pace ourselves on those kinds of investments, so that's helped. Rodney, you may want to comment a little bit on just how you see gross generally in the quarter. W. McMullen: Yes, I would agree with the comments Dave made. One of the things that, over the last several years, we've worked really hard to make sure that we understand what cost reductions we're getting and trying to make sure that we manage our gross investments, tying in and getting costs out. I would say that probably our internal estimation systems, we feel they're of a little higher quality in terms of giving us really better estimates in terms of what we're seeing on taking costs out because of our operations team and our finance team working together, which then, in turn, makes it a little easier to balance that with selling gross changes too. David Dillon : Now one thing you ought to recognize, too, is that the moderation you saw in the first quarter was at least, in part, helped by the gross margin in pharmacy. Rodney commented on that in his prepared remarks, that pharmacy, because of the change to generics, has -- the sales dollars are down, our script count is terrific, but the effect on gross, it tends to flip it a little bit because the gross margin has been improved. Rodney you want to comment... W. McMullen: Well, yes, I was just going to say the change in pharmacy made a huge effect in the total numbers. So if you look at the individual pieces, it would have actually been a little more than what it appears on the total. David Dillon : And I thought that's important for you to know, but that was still on a very planned basis. I mean, we knew exactly where pharmacy was headed, and I could see that completely coming. So it wasn't a surprise to us at all. Edward Kelly : And one very quick follow-up for Mike. Mike, is your SG&A comparison in the second quarter as difficult as it looks? Dollars weren't -- not up much last year. Should we consider that in the model? J. Schlotman: Yes, I don't think it's something you should be overly concerned with. I can't think of anything that we're facing right now as compared to the prior year. And it's -- our expectations for the quarter are certainly baked into our guidance. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Kenneth Goldman : A few quarters ago, you had such, I guess, intense promotional spending from your vendors who sell branded food that your share of private label actually went down temporarily. I'm curious, I guess, if you can update us on the promotional dynamic today among your branded vendors in general. And the reason I'm asking is we're seeing some data today from Nielsen that would suggest maybe a broader number of grocery items sold on promotion today, but we're not seeing either way how deep some of those discounts are. So I guess I'm just curious for any color on the promotional dynamic overall among your grocery vendors. David Dillon : I'll see if Rodney wants to give you specifics, but before he does, I would just say the keyword you used was dynamic. And you should think of this as changing all the time, I mean, every month, every quarter. So I don't know that we're going to be able to identify a clear pattern for you. But Rodney, you have any comments on that? W. McMullen: I mean, if you just look at over a long period of time, private label or corporate brands have continued to gain share. Usually, what happens is some CPGs will make more money than they should be because the raw material costs haven't increased. And that always provides a huge umbrella for corporate brands to gain share, which happens. Then, the CPGs will get a little more aggressive with promotional dollars, which will bring it back down. But what we find is very seldom does the share ever go back to where it was before. There is a permanent loss when CPGs do that. So it is, as Dave mentioned, it's a dynamic process, but we -- overall, we think that's one of the really important reasons and critical for us to have such a strong corporate brand program that connects with customers. Operator : Your next question comes from Shane Higgins with Deutsche Bank. Shane Higgins : Could you guys just talk about, I mean, obviously, there's been a lot of focus on rates. If rates -- and I guess, Mike, you could -- maybe you can answer this. If rates back up another 50 or 100 basis points, what's going to be the overall impact on your expenses, say, over the next year or 2? Will that actually be a net positive since it could take certain expenses, such as pensions, down a little bit? J. Schlotman: It'll have some marginal effect on the funded status of my corporate plan. Keep in mind that all the UFCW funds that we participate in actually present value their lability at the expected rate of return, not current interest rate, so it really won't have any affect on my UFCW funded status. And the contributions to those funds are dictated by a contractual obligation anyway, not necessarily an exact funded status. So I don't really see any effect on my operating expenses as it relates to the backup in rates. Even the -- it's interesting to talk about a 2.4% 10-year treasury or so as the backup in rates because it's still a historically low treasury rate. And even if I had to refinance the debt I have coming due at these rates, I still wind up leveraging down the weighted average cost of my debt portfolio. So I'm still comfortable we're going to be able to execute the financial strategy we have. Plus, as I said earlier in my prepared comments, we've actually been utilizing the -- our commercial paper availability rather than accessing the market because we've been able to borrow at such low rates. And it helped the first quarter probably by $0.005. So I don't really see a huge positive or negative at this point from where rates are. Shane Higgins : And just a question on the fuel rewards program. Have you guys made any significant changes to the fuel rewards promotions, particularly as more and more competitors roll out these similar programs? W. McMullen: We would continually offer different promotions on fuel rewards, things like that. But it -- it's one of the nice things about being first in the market. It continues to connect extremely well with our customers and especially our oil customers. But there's always different offers that you'll do in a specific market from time to time. Operator : Your next question comes from Andrew Wolf with BB&T Capital Markets. Andrew Wolf : Dave, I think I've asked you this before, but when you mentioned the variability of sales, not too surprising given some changes in payroll taxes and so on, but has -- or are you trying to tell us the amplitude? Or  has that gotten worse, better or stayed the same? David Dillon : I'd say it's about like it had been, that in short-term periods for like a day or a week, often unpredictable, but there's a reasonably clear pattern we've seen once you extend the time period to go to a period or a quarter. So yes, I'd say it's pretty much like what we've been seeing. Rodney? W. McMullen: The only thing that I would add and this is if you look at electronic benefit transfers, states continue to change the days that the dollars go out on benefits, which also causes some of the variability. And you don't know how much of that variability is just because of that change or how much of it is broader than just that change. Andrew Wolf : Okay. So obviously, when it's smoothed out over a quarter or what have you, things are fine. Your IDs are excellent. But how about operationally? I mean, are you trying to say it's harder to set store hours because it's harder to predict who's coming in what day? W. McMullen: It certainly is harder to make sure you stay in stock. And I think our teams are doing a great job doing that, but it does -- any type of variability obviously makes it a little more complicated to manage against. Andrew Wolf : And I also wanted to follow up just on the guidance. You were above your internal expectations and then raised guidance a little bit. So is that -- I just want to underline this or ask you to underline this. Is that more what you're seeing out there either with the consumer or with pricing and competition? Or is it -- it just it -- is it just it's early yet and you just don't want to raise guidance more than you might want -- at this juncture raise guidance more than you did? J. Schlotman: No, I think we're comfortable with the guidance we gave and it's where we believe we'll wind up on the year. Obviously, we raised the low end a little more than the high end, and that's because of the strength of the first quarter. We think that the low, the potential low end will be better than we originally thought. And I do want to remind folks that the fourth quarter, we do, as we sit here today, on a 12-week, 12-week basis, expect that to be behind because of the LIFO swing. And that's in our numbers, but not necessarily in everybody else's numbers. Andrew Wolf : Fair enough. And I understand about the guidance. I guess your guidance is your guidance. But I guess I'm trying to say is -- was there any change during the quarter or now, competitively or with the consumer, that has changed your thinking on the year? J. Schlotman: I think relative to what we see for the rest of the year, we remain committed to what our original guidance was. And we tried to compare to our original expectations. And we flowed that through our annual expectations, and we're comfortable what we -- with what we see from our original expectations for the rest of the year. Andrew Wolf : And this is probably for Rodney. Rodney, in the past, when you -- people ask you about M&A, you said a lot of the chains don't pencil out because their pricing in the market's too high. Now as I think about the portfolio of banners at Kroger, you actually run some high end and low end, such as Food 4 Less and Quality Foods, one which goes at a discount versus conventionals, one that goes at a premium. So how do you view -- when things come up in the marketplace that are either discount or premium type banners that are for sale, how do you view looking at their relative pricing? Do you still want it to be in line with the market, which you would, I guess, for typical conventional? Or do you adjust that thinking for the type of banner that you're -- that is out there in the marketplace? J. Schlotman: Yes. I won't give any insight into how we actually analyze any opportunity that comes up. We -- as we've said historically, we look at a lot of things when they come up, act on a very little of that, and actually, when I say act, make an offer on very little of that, and have a deal come to fruition even on less assets than that. If you look at our pattern over the last several years, we continue to be very happy with the fill-in acquisitions we've done. But to give specifics on how we might look at a particular group of stores, I just don't see any upside in going down that path. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Kelly Bania with Merrill Lynch. Kelly Bania : Just curious on private label now. You mentioned some changes into how you're measuring the units and the dollars in that category. Can you remind us or let us know what categories are now in there? And then I guess related to that, how do you think about the Simple Truth line and shelf space there? I guess what I'm wondering, is there opportunity to add more? It sounds like it still continues to go very well. W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at the private label share that I outlined, it includes all the departments except for fuel and pharmacy, so it would include produce, meat, seafood, drug/GM, plus the grocery categories that we've always done in the past. So it's the complete store excluding pharmacy and fuel. Those things we thought would be a little complicated because we're not -- the generic drugs, do you put it as private label or not, and then obviously, fuel, we sell all our fuel unbranded. So that's what's included in the market share and the unit share that I talked about. I'm going to broaden your question a little bit in terms of if you look at shelf space, the model that we use to determine whether an item gets on the shelf is exactly the same for our corporate brands as it is for national brands, because we don't want -- we want to make sure, from a customer standpoint, the same dynamic is driving the location on a shelf and the item itself, whether it even gets on the shelf. The accountability for that has to be the same for our corporate brands just like a national brand. In terms of Simple Truth, it's been obviously a huge home run. It's connected really well with our customers. Because of that, it -- the brand itself is earning more shelf space, and we continue to find new items that will fit nicely into that Free From 101 different ingredients and Simple Truth Organic. So it's working really well, but it's earning its way there because of the connection with our customer. Kelly Bania : Great, that's very helpful. And then if I could just follow up with one more question on gas. It looks like your gas margin came in a little bit lower for the quarter year-over-year, and I'm just wondering if you can remind us how you're planning that segment for the year in terms of profitability. And then just remind us, you mentioned that half of your stores, roughly half your stores have the gas offering. Is there much trend -- difference in trend in traffic or IDs right now, particularly with gas prices a little bit lower right now year-over-year? David Dillon : Mike, you want to address that? J. Schlotman: Well, when you look at fuel, any one quarter can be somewhat volatile on fuel margins in retails, which is why we talked about that. Relative to what we saw in the first quarter compared to our expectations for the year, I would say the first quarter wasn't that far out of the ballpark when you look at the comparisons of the numbers that we talked about at the supermarkets. They weren't wildly different, and it's clearly something that, as I said, we expect fuel to be a contributor to the overall growth of the company. Fuel earned a little bit less in the first quarter than it earned last year in the first quarter, but we experience that from time to time, and my guess is there'll be a period of time this year where it earns more from year-to-year. Relative to the -- why we put them at the fuels -- at our supermarkets essentially, it's just one more thing that we can solve a convenience for and offer a value to the customer, where, when they're already at our store and they come to -- our most loyal customers come to our stores 2, 3 or 4 times a week, and they have the availability of fuel there along with the fuel rewards, it's an incremental reason for them to want to come to Kroger versus a competitor. And it's clearly part of the overall value proposition our customers see. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason DeRise with UBS. Jason DeRise : Sorry, if there's background noise here. I'm on the road, and once I ask it, I'll mute. Could you quantify the gross margin impact from the pharmacy? Could you also talk about the impact on gross margins from ending the double couponing in many of your banners? And then actually the follow-up to the last question, if you could actually quantify the difference in same-store sales for your stores with and without fuel stations? W. McMullen: In terms of the gross margin effect from pharmacy, I won't break it out separately. It was a meaningful number, but I won't break it out separately. On double coupons, we invested the monies that were saved from double coupons into lower everyday pricing. So if you look in total, it actually had no effect on gross margin. Because what we found was there wasn't very many customers actually engaged with double coupons, and we felt like it was better to give lower prices to all customers, so all customers could get the benefit of that. So it really didn't affect much. And then identical sales with and without fuel locations, that, obviously for competitive reasons, we have not shared and wouldn't think it's appropriate to share at this point either. Jason DeRise : On the gross margin for the pharmacy, the impact, if I put out a number, will you say if that makes sense or not? Kind of in the 20- to 30-basis-point range as a positive in that result? W. McMullen: I won't. I don't know whether, Dave or Mike, if there's any insights that you can help -- that you would think Jason could find helpful. David Dillon : No, I don't think there's anything else to add other than I don't think you would find the quarter and the variations and stuff to be unusual. The only thing that was unusual here is, and you can see with the 15-basis-point investment in our gross margin, that that's a little smaller than where we ran in any of the quarters last year. And we've just identified that the reason it was as moderate as it was, was, in large part, because it was helped from the pharmacy. Now we knew that going in and had that expectation. So, it was part of a planned program, but that's about as far as I think we're going to be able to go. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Priya Ohri-Gupta with Barclays. Priya Ohri-Gupta: I was hoping that you could provide a little bit more color around how we should think about your long-term debt market needs for the duration of this year. We appreciate the commentary around your shift to CP usage. Should we expect that to continue or is there a potential need for you to come back into the long-term debt markets this year? J. Schlotman: At some point in time this year, we will access the fixed income markets and term out some of the debt. We just made the strategic decision early on in the year because we have plenty of capacity on our revolver. Our exposure to floating rates over the last several years has actually been relatively modest. So to try to adjust for that, we've termed out in the short -- in the short run on work -- on our commercial -- well, it's the commercial paper that we issued backstopped by our bank revolver. The -- if you look at that trend since then, the balance of that has come in some, because this is really the point in time of the year where we generate a lot of cash flow. And that also gave us the comfort to have it out there on the commercial paper markets. When we think about issuing it at, let's say, between 40 and 45 basis points on a regular basis, as compared even to historically low rates...  [Technical Difficulty] Priya Ohri-Gupta: Sorry, can you hear us? J. Schlotman: We can now. Somehow, we lost the connection. Priya Ohri-Gupta: Okay. I think you got cut off right after you talked about issuing on a regular basis at about 40 to 45 basis points. J. Schlotman: Okay. I appreciate you telling me how much of my wonderful answer I gave. See if I can repeat it now. So Cindy will look at the transcript to see how close the 2 of them compare. But we've been very successful with being able to issue that debt, as I said, in the 40- to 45-basis-point range. The fact of the matter is this part of the year is when we generate a lot of free cash flow. So we felt taking a little bit of risk of terming that -- putting that out on a working capital line made sense. We don't have, historically, a lot of floating rate exposure, and it was really an attempt to gain a little bit more exposure to floating rates. The amount of commercial paper we have outstanding has come in since then. But as you may or may not have heard me say, we do expect at some point this year to term out some of our longer-term debt needs. Priya Ohri-Gupta: Do you have any sense or could you give us any guidance on potential size or part of the curve that you might look at? J. Schlotman: I don't want to give too much insight to it. You can look at our 10-Q or 10-K, and you can see how many dollars we've had hedged to give you some insight to what we think we -- our expectations and needs may be. But as far as the exact amount and what duration those may be, we'll wait and see what the markets are like when we actually access the markets. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tiffany Kanaga with Citi. Tiffany Kanaga : Can we get an update on how online retail and home delivery is going at King Soopers? And are there any thoughts around expanding it to other markets? W. McMullen: As you know, we've been experimenting with Denver for several years. It continues to grow at a modest rate. We're working on it as much in terms of understanding the economics and trying to get a model that actually is profitable. So it's one of those things where you should see us continue to work on it to improve it. We've actually changed our team -- our complete digital team, in terms of bringing some high talent from the outside to help us accelerate our growth. We feel very good about where we are headed. And as you know, from a digital standpoint, it's broader than just what you sell online. We also are very aggressive on making sure we use our strength and insights we already have on our digital strategy, based on customer needs. We're having huge growth in terms of the use of our website, the use and download of our apps, and we're also partnering with dunnhumby to improve those from a relevancy standpoint. So we actually are looking at digital much broader than just what you sell online, and we're making huge progress in terms of connecting with the customer digitally, and partnering with dunnhumby to do that in a way that uses our strengths and insights. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Joe Feldman of Telsey Advisory Group. Joseph Feldman : Wanted to ask sort of a bigger picture question. Just with the recent launch of like AmazonFresh and there's more talk of delivery and e-commerce shopping for groceries, and I was just wondering if you could provide us with kind of your latest updates and thoughts on, I guess, e-commerce strategies or digital strategies within the grocery business. W. McMullen: The -- I'll give a little bit -- just in terms of -- tied in and talked -- some of the comments I just made to Tiffany. As you know, we've had, where we deliver in Denver, for several years and -- a website where we sell through. As I mentioned a couple of minutes ago, we continue to work on how to get that to scale and profitability. But we think it's important to look at it more than just what you sell on the web and how do you connect with a customer on an overall digital basis, and making sure we use some of the strengths and insights we have. We're having huge growth with people downloading our apps, using our apps on almost a daily type basis. And we partnered with dunnhumby in terms of making that relevant for each customer, using each customer in terms of setting the prioritization. We feel really good about where we're headed, and it's something we continue to work on and we continue to get better and better at. And selling is just one piece of that connection with the customer digitally. Joseph Feldman : Got you. Got you. I mean, do you envision like a store pickup type of program? Or are you testing that anywhere? W. McMullen: The -- we would be testing almost everything that you can imagine, but I think, at the end of the day, there will be something that will be a combination of a lot of different pieces together. And we actually think that, that's one of the strengths that will play to us, just because we have so many convenient stores located close to customers' houses that it'll be left up to customer in terms of how they want to engage with us. Joseph Feldman : Got it. And then one last one and I apologize for repeating that question, but with -- the Affordable Care Act and how are you guys thinking about that? What kind of impact do you think it might have on you guys and your business, on the labor negotiations that you have? Just any thoughts and more color on that would be helpful. David Dillon : Well, it certainly affects, in one way or another, everything you do that touches health care. So in all of our union negotiations, whether it's at the trust fund level or in the negotiations themselves, you have to make sure that the health care plans work their way to complying with and, actually, working together with what the Affordable Health Care Act requires. So we've been going through that process in negotiations, and it certainly adds some degree of tension in the negotiations. But we have a good, really solid working relationship with the locals that we work with, and as you've seen, the contracts get settled over the last, really couple of years. All of those have had some implications from the Affordable Health Care Act. As to the company plan, we have done the same thing within our own organization of making sure that we've worked through understanding those requirements and including them in our own plans. In terms of costs, sure, we think they will go up a little. We're not -- I don't think we've publicly quantified that and nor do we intend to today. But I think it's all been -- so far, been workable, and we've been happy with the way things have worked out so far. Rodney, you want to add anything? W. McMullen: No, no. Joseph Feldman : Okay. So you -- I mean, I guess maybe deeper into the year, we'll get a better sense of what you're thinking as far as -- I mean, I guess, I'm trying to understand like will there be any kind of an EPS impact. Really, it's more a 2014 thing. And I know you don't want to quantify it today, but just should we expect that maybe at the October meeting or... David Dillon : Well, what you should expect is that we took into account what we know about health care costs when we gave you the guidance in March and when we updated the guidance today for this year. And we also have in mind and have a sense of what we see in health care trends when we gave you the long-term guidance of our earnings growth of the 8% to 11%, plus a growing dividend. So we're knowledgeable of that when we made those decisions. So to that extent, it's been included in what we've told you. Operator : Your next question is a follow-up from the line of Jason DeRise. Jason DeRise : I just thought that -- again, sorry, for the background noise, but I thought the comment about the convenience stores, as they fit into this omni-channel Kroger, was really interesting. And I wanted to get a sense of how far into the future do you think that would be a reality, of the omni-channel Kroger using all the points in online and pickups. I know in the past, it's been said that Kroger is a slow Midwest-moving company, but some of these other retailers are thinking about this more aggressively. So if you can comment on that, that would be great. W. McMullen: Well, it's really -- I mean, our strategy is really built around letting the customers decide digitally how they want to connect with us. And we spent a ton of effort and energy making sure that we do an awful lot of research and testing things enough to understand the economics of what we're doing. So it's really taking all the pieces and tying them together. And when -- you should expect to see us, when we find something that makes money, we'll move very aggressively. And until then, you'll see us continuing to test to make sure we're involved and aware, but we don't see a benefit of rolling something out that doesn't create value for our customers and our investors as well. Jason DeRise : Hopefully, we hear more about this during the Investor Day. David Dillon : And I think that's our last question. Given that we had disruption a couple of times on the call, I thought it would be best to run a little longer and make sure we got all the questions in, and we appreciate all of those. We apologize for the 2 interruptions that we had. And as I usually do, before we end the call today, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates who are listening in today. We encourage them to do that.  First, I want to thank each of the 400 -- or 4,800 leaders around the country who joined us for the first-ever Kroger Leadership Summit in Louisville recently. Because of you, this event was a big success. Taking the next steps in our Customer 1st journey together is important, and we're inspired by the enthusiasm and the passion that you show for leading our associates and serving our customers. We know you will continue to make a difference everyday for our customers and our communities.  Also this month, we celebrate community service in a special way at Kroger. Through widespread volunteer activities, our associates help strengthen the communities where we live and work. We're pleased to recognize, in our Annual Report, 29 associates across the company for their outstanding service as recipients of Kroger's 2012 Community Service Award. These women and men give their time and talent to feed the homeless, raise money to fight cancer and coach at-risk teens, among many other causes, and we are grateful for their commitment.  I want to personally thank all our associates from coast to coast, who volunteer in so many ways. Rodney and I are touched by the work you do. You make a big difference for so many others in all the places around America that we call home. That completes our call today. We thank you all for joining us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

My name is Derek, and I'll be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ms. Cindy Holmes, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed. Cindy Holmes : Thank you, Derek. Good morning, and thank you for joining us.  Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.  Both our second quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] We are hopeful that you can join us for our 2013 Investor Conference in New York on October 30. We look forward to seeing many of you then. I will now turn the call over to Dave Dillon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kroger. David Dillon : Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today.  With me to review Kroger's second quarter 2013 results are Rodney McMullen, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  I am very pleased with our strong second quarter results, which puts us on target to deliver the identical supermarket sales and earnings per share growth we promised for the year. Kroger's second quarter operating performance and financial results show that the common thread in our story is consistency.  We achieved our 39th consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales, maintained return on invested capital and expanded FIFO operating margin without fuel on a rolling 4-quarter basis. Every supermarket division and every department had positive ID sales.  We controlled costs throughout the business. As you know, we announced a merger agreement with Harris Teeter, a company we have admired for a long time, which will expand Kroger's footprint into new exciting growth markets. And customers continue to tell us our associates are improving their shopping experience.  As we've shown quarter after quarter, our consistent execution of the Customer 1st Strategy deepens customer loyalty, increases sales and creates sustainable shareholder value. As you know, the list that I've just covered was prepared in advance so that we could formally review the quarter that we just finished. I'm not sure it does the quarter justice, so let me depart from our normal script and describe our results this way.  We've just completed what is nearly 10 years of positive identical sales growth. We have invested in price for each of those 10 years when compared to the year before. At the same time, we focused on lowering our costs. We've actually lowered our costs now for over 8 consecutive years.  Last year, in our investor meeting, we raised the guidance for our long-term earnings performance expectations. In fact, for the past 2 years, and our guidance suggests that this 2013 would be the third year, we've been performing within this new higher earnings per share growth range already. Plus, don't forget the dividends.  Also, last October, we offered a number of other keys to our successful growth plans for future years. Everything you're hearing today in our quarter suggests we're on the path to successfully achieve all of those goals that we set out for you last year in October.  Maybe even more important, the progress we've achieved these past 10 years sets a wonderful foundation on which to build for an even brighter future. And the most important part of all is that the team at Kroger is large, broad-based, with dedicated associates, team Kroger, who have collectively come together to achieve these results. And it is that combination that I think is unmatched in the industry today.  The results achieved by our team, team Kroger, make me most proud. I don't use words lightly, this quarter especially, when I say we are very proud of the quarter we have just delivered.  Now I'd like Rodney to cover some more details about the second quarter. Rodney? W. McMullen: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. As you know, we regularly seek customer feedback on how well we are executing in each of the 4 key areas of our Customer 1st Strategy. We continue to improve our performance in each area and our efforts are being noticed. Customers are telling us that our associates continue to connect with them by showing them that our people are great, our product selection and quality is improving, we are making the shopping experience faster and easier and we continue to give our customers better value for their money.  Doing the 4 keys together is what separates us from our competitors, competitors of both the past and the future, because the hard part is doing all 4 and doing them reliably. We are also more agile in balancing our investments in the 4 keys with the savings we realize and we are consistently improving the efficiency of those investments on a rolling 4-quarter basis. Our lower gross profit rate today means customers are saving nearly $3 billion a year compared to when we started this journey.  I want to echo Dave's appreciation and also thank our associates for keeping their focus on our customers and delivering shareholder value. We are very proud of reaching a merger agreement with Harris Teeter and we are especially pleased it has not diverted our associates' efforts to achieve a good quarter and continuing -- continue to driving the business.  One of the most important measures of our business is loyal household growth. It lets us know how well we are connecting with our best customers. And our loyal customers, on average, spend about half of every $1 with Kroger, which means we have tremendous opportunity to increase their spending across our family of stores.  During the second quarter, we grew the number of loyal households. Our loyal household count grew at a much faster rate than total household growth, which was also up for the quarter.  Overall, customers continue to visit our stores more frequently, purchase fewer items per trip and buy more on a monthly basis. Total units sold were up compared to last year. We estimate the rate of product cost inflation at 1.6%, excluding fuel and pharmacy.  As we've discussed throughout the year, and in fact for the last several years, consumer confidence continues to improve but at a slow and steady pace.  Factors that affect consumer confidence at any given time include fluctuating gas prices, payroll taxes and government policy uncertainty, along with the overall state of the economy. We continue to monitor these factors closely. Overall, we would characterize the economy as continue to improve but fragile.  Kroger leveraged operating expenses in the second quarter as associates did a good job controlling costs and driving positive identical sales. Our OG&A costs plus rent and depreciation, without fuel, were down 17 basis points as a percent of sales. On this basis and excluding one-time items, as Dave mentioned before, we've improved this metric for 8 consecutive years and our year-to-date results have set us up to achieve our ninth consecutive year.  Now I'd like to update you on our corporate brands offering, which is one of our key differentiators for Kroger versus our competition. Our focus is on new products, which we are continually evolving as customer tastes change. We have modeled our team to facilitate a culture of innovation. This year alone, we will have introduced more than 650 new items by the end of the year.  In the second quarter, corporate brands represented approximately 24.5% of total units sold and sales dollars were 23.8%, excluding fuel and pharmacy.  Finally, an update on labor relations. Our store associates ratified new labor agreements, covering stores in Indianapolis, Roanoke and Little Rock. We have several contracts that have expired or will expire soon, including contracts in Seattle, Cincinnati and Dallas.  Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages; good quality, affordable health care; and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, have a shared objective : growing Kroger's business and profitability, which will in turn help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. In fact, over the last 5 years, we've added 33,000 jobs.  Now Mike will offer more detail on Kroger's second quarter financial results and our guidance for the year. Mike? J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone.  Total sales increased 4.6% to $22.7 billion in the second quarter compared with $21.7 billion for the same period last year. Total sales, excluding fuel, increased 3.9% in the second quarter over the same period last year.  Net earnings for the second quarter totaled $317 million, or $0.60 per diluted share. Net earnings for the second quarter of last year were $279 million, or $0.51 per diluted share. FIFO gross margin, including fuel, was 20.6 -- 20.46% of sales for the second quarter. Excluding retail fuel operations, FIFO gross margin decreased 11 basis points from the same period last year. The company recorded a $13 million LIFO charge during the quarter compared to a $35 million LIFO charge in the same quarter last year. This is consistent with our original expectations. FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel and the extra week in fiscal 2012 on a rolling 4 quarters basis, increased 9 basis points.  Turning now to retail fuel operations. We disclosed many items with and without fuel due to its effect on operating cost and gross profit rates, but we view fuel as a core department that, over time, is expected to contribute to earnings per share growth. About half of our supermarkets have fuel centers today.  In the second quarter, our supermarket centers -- our supermarket fuel center's rolling 4-quarter margin per gallon was approximately $0.14 compared to $0.136 a year ago, excluding the 53rd week. Total gallons sold showed solid growth.  On a rolling 52-week basis, return on invested capital grew slightly to 13.49% compared to 13.44% during the same period last year. As we increase capital, it will be more difficult to grow ROIC in the near term. However, as these investments mature, we expect them to be accretive to return on invested capital.  Our planned uses of cash remain unchanged : maintain our current investment grade debt rating, repurchase shares, pay dividends to shareholders and fund capital investments.  You will see on our balance sheet that our current portion of long-term debt has decreased because of our recent financings and our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio has declined to 1.77. We have not been repurchasing as many shares as we originally expected at the beginning of the year. This is purely because of our work to prepare for the Harris Teeter merger. This lower ratio gives us the flexibility to finance the Harris Teeter transaction and we are now well positioned to reestablish and maintain our targeted 2x to 2.2x net total debt-to-EBITDA ratio, in line with our long-term financial strategy, within 18 months after the Harris Teeter transaction closes.  In fact, this puts us in a better position than we originally expected from a debt standpoint. We are committed to executing our financial strategy, including maintaining our current investment grade rating and repurchasing shares.  During the quarter, Kroger repurchased 2.4 million common shares for a total investment of $90 million. Kroger's strong financial position has allowed the company to return more than $920 million to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last 4 quarters. Capital investment, excluding acquisitions and purchases of leased property, totaled $507 million for the quarter compared to $444 million for the same period last year. Year-to-date, we have spent $1.1 billion. We continue to expect full year capital investments to be in the $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion range.  Now I'll update our growth objectives for fiscal 2013. We are maintaining our net earnings guidance to a range of $2.73 to $2.80 per diluted share for the year. This is consistent with our long-term growth rate guidance of 8% to 11% based on fiscal 2012 adjusted earnings per share of $2.52. Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend that we expect to grow over time.  Keep in mind, our long-term growth rate assumes no effect from year-over-year LIFO swings. A higher LIFO charge in any given quarter or year will lower the growth and a lower LIFO charge will increase the growth.  As you look at our guidance for the year, please note that we expect an EPS growth rate in the third quarter similar to what we reported today for the second quarter. We still expect this year's fourth quarter to be behind the third -- fourth quarter of last year on a 12-week basis. This is because we currently assume a $13 million LIFO charge in the fourth quarter compared to a $41 million credit in the fourth quarter of last year.  The bottom line of this is we think current estimates for the third quarter are a little low and for the fourth quarter, they're a little high but by offsetting amounts. This is why we continue to be comfortable with the $2.73 to $2.80 per share level for the year.  We are increasing our identical supermarket sales growth expectations, excluding fuel, to approximately 3% to 3.5% for fiscal 2013. The original guidance was 2.5% to 3.5%.  And now I'll turn it back to Dave. David Dillon : Thanks, Mike. I'm really proud of what we are accomplishing. We're growing in such a consistent way that it may seem deceptively simple. But the truth is that our hard work over the past 10 years since we began our Customer 1st journey has created a platform for sustainable growth. We are improving our connection with customers and associates, creating new jobs and strengthening job security and rewarding shareholders with consistent earnings per share and dividend growth.  Now we are happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from the line of John Heinbockel, Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : So guys, 2 things. One, when you look at the 50% share of loyal households, when you talk to those customers and get a sense why they're not spending the other -- a larger piece with you, what do you typically hear from them? And then secondly, I know you want to -- you don't want to give too much detail here, but where do you think there are particular opportunities where you're way under-indexing with those loyal customers in certain product categories? W. McMullen: Well, thanks, John. If you look at why they're not shopping with us, it's kind of interesting. When we talk to them, they'll tell us they're actually giving us more business than they give us. And it's really a mixture of 2 things : one, things that they don't put on their Kroger list and they, just for the last several years, just put it on another retailer list; and the other part would be when they're out taking their kids to soccer practice or some other type of event, they'll just stop by and pick up a few items somewhere else. And most times, people will pick up a few extra things. The big opportunities, the easiest way to answer it, there are certain categories where we've significantly improved what we offer from a variety and a price standpoint that those customers don't realize that we've changed. And it really is trying to make sure the customers realize the improvements that we've made, would be the biggest opportunities that I could answer your question without giving a tremendous amount of detail. Obviously, there's a lot of detail behind that statement. John Heinbockel : But it's safe to say that the things that they might think of first in another retailer, whether it be paper, cleaning, HBA, I would think those are all areas where you probably under-indexed as opposed to food. Correct? W. McMullen: That would be correct. Anything that's not food-related, we would probably under-index on. John Heinbockel : Okay. And then secondly, because I know you guys like to kind of peer around the corner a little bit, what's the current take? Because I know you've been a little bit skeptical about the whole food e-commerce channel. Do you think that will ultimately be, maybe not 2 years from now but 5 or 10 years, something people will -- it'll be more mainstream and something you want to start noodling around with? And if so, do you still think it would be more store-level pickup, a better option for the consumer, ultimately, than home delivery, as you think about it? W. McMullen: Well, we continue to experiment with it, as you know, in Denver, Colorado, we have for the last several years. We have a few customers that are very loyal to it, but it's modestly growing and it has modestly grown for a long period of time. We think, over time, it'll just be one part of the way a customer shops, along with physical assets too. So we don't think it's \"in place of,\" we think it's \"part of.\" And we're really focused on trying to deliver something along those lines. One of the things -- we're looking forward to merging with Harris Teeter. Harris Teeter has a pickup model in a lot of their stores. We don't have too much -- we have a little bit of insight, but it's very little at this point until we merge, because obviously, in some markets, we're in the same markets together. So you don't have the complete understanding of how successful it is, but we want to make sure we understand that and what pieces of that make sense to use in other places. David Dillon : And John, I would add that we're thrilled in the meantime at the development of the whole digital world and how our customers are engaging with us. Everything from the Kroger app to the online work we do, to the downloading of digital coupons, has all been very successful for us. W. McMullen: Yes. It's kind of exciting, but if you look at our digital app now, it's one of the top 2% -- it's in the top 2% of downloads off of -- from Apple. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Scott Mushkin, Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : I had a kind of housekeeping one to start off with. I know you gave us the 4-quarter rolling on fuel. Did you have it for just this quarter on fuel penny profit? W. McMullen: It was higher than the rolling 4 quarters. Go ahead and ask your second question and I'll get -- I don't have that exact number in front of me, but we'll get it. Scott Mushkin : Okay. And then kind of along what John was asking, but maybe asking it a little bit different way, it's a more strategic question. Kroger's probably been the biggest share gainer in the industry for a long time, I think partly because you've just driven the price gaps down with Walmart and then also widened them with some of your conventional guise. But you also did a huge amount on service and perishables and merchandising. But I guess the question is, going forward, how do you envision share gains? Can you -- do you think you can keep up the same pace? And what's going to be the biggest mechanism to drive it? David Dillon : Well, it's -- as I mentioned in my own comments, we see this as a sustainable model that continues to build on itself. And I think the most important fact that demonstrates that we believe this can continue for a very long time is the fact that roughly half of the business our best customers can give us, they are giving someplace else. And Rodney addressed that in his comments earlier. I think that's the best evidence. Now there's plenty of other evidence, too. Just the fact that we have 39 quarters in a row of positive identical sales illustrates that there's -- continues to be room to grow. And so we think that the future is still bright and that we see very good opportunity to grow our market share ahead. W. McMullen: Hey, Scott, [indiscernible] in the quarter was $0.17 versus $0.164 last year. So while higher, the spread was about the same. So the profit margin per gallon in the quarter was 6/10 higher and the rolling fourth quarter was 4/10 higher. So the incremental was not that significantly different, even though the absolute number was higher. Scott Mushkin : I appreciate that. And then my last question goes to kind of the current environment. Are you seeing anything different out there as far as your current trends go? But also, I wanted to talk about, there has been a lot of talk of some changes to the food stamp program. Some of those are just going to happen and then maybe there's going to be some further adjustments as we go forward into the fall. So both current environment and then how you're thinking about the current environment, vis-\u00e0-vis some of these changes that may roll through the food stamp program. David Dillon : I'm not sure I followed the first part of your question about current trends. You're just talking about generally in the economy? Scott Mushkin : Yes, generally in the economy and your -- I guess your trends. I mean, are you seeing anything different out of the consumer that you've been -- that lifts your comps that you've produced this quarter? And then as we go forward, how are you thinking of your business, particularly on the sales line, with the pending cuts? David Dillon : Well, first, as you saw, we moved the lower end of our sales guidance up, which should tell you that we are reasonably confident in what the second half of this year looks like. Sales so far, we have 3.5 weeks in this quarter. And while that's hard to predict, it's a whole quarter from that. But they are slightly ahead of where we were for the second quarter. So we're good -- we're comfortable with that picture. Rodney described the economy. The way we're thinking about it is it's still quite fragile but continues to improve and those signs of improvement are many. So there's lots of categories and items and areas that you would say are more kind of discretionary items that people are buying more of today than they were before. And the growth in areas like apparel and cosmetics and toys and greeting cards, Starbucks, sushi, all of those areas, natural food, Boar's Head, cheese, prepared meals, all of those are doing really well and growing at good pace. Food stamps are still at a reasonably high level. They did kind of plateau for a while. And you could argue right now, in the last few weeks, anyway, that there's been a slight softening, but it's still at a very high level. And so I wouldn't read too much into that. Your question about food stamps is what happens if those get cut substantially. And I know there's lots of conversations in the Congress on that topic. We, of course, don't know how Congress comes out on that. We don't know how the states will come out on that. We do know that there's a reasonably high demand for food stamps. But remember that food stamp customers also spend some of their own cash on food. That's not their only source to pay for food with us. And while we have a lot of households that use food stamps, just the fact that we've seen some little softening in these last few weeks and yet the sales through the 3.5 weeks I've just mentioned is a little stronger than last quarter, that's a good sign, too. That even in a case where food stamps might get a little softer, we still think we can do quite well in sales. Rodney, do you want to add anything to that? W. McMullen: No, I mean, it's something that we certainly look at and we work every day trying to make sure that we give all customers a better value for their money. And if you look at our digital app and everything that we're doing, we're trying to make sure that we continue to take costs out of the business so we can give the customers a better value for their money. So hopefully, the customer that's on food stamps would be able to take advantage of many of those opportunities as well. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Deborah Weinswig, Citigroup. Deborah Weinswig : So if you look back to the beginning of the year when you had a 2.5% to 3.5% projection and now raising the bottom end of that to 3% to 3.5%, what have been the biggest differences in terms of -- whether it be consumer behavior but just in terms of increasing confidence, et cetera? David Dillon : Actually, the -- I think the answer is a silly answer, but it's a 6 months passage of time, that before we were looking at a whole 4 quarters, trying to predict where it was going to be, and now we've seen 2 of the quarters and we just have 6 months left in front of us to try to predict. And I think we feel more confident of that. But the factors are the same that I listed with Scott that helped get us to a confident level. Deborah Weinswig : Okay. And then in terms of -- if you look at the general merchandise sales that you've seen so far, could you just maybe give us some color in terms of what you've seen in the quarter? And will you also see pockets of opportunity as well? David Dillon : Well, we certainly see pockets of opportunity. But in the GM -- I listed several GM categories that I've noted have improved, and GM on the whole has improved. One of the points I made earlier was that all of our departments had positive identical sales and GM did have reasonably good improvement. But it had been, for a long time, it had been more of a laggard. So we're glad to see some improvements there. You want to add anything, Rodney? W. McMullen: Well, I was just going to say, it was a little embarrassing, but in terms of the opportunity, I think we're really -- the Fred Meyer team is really having a tremendous amount of success, working deeper with all their divisions across the company and picking up some good new items across the company. We're having very good success on identifying the right items to add in our stores. We're starting to reduce some of our marketplace stores with categories different than what we initially did and very pleased with the success there. You could -- if you looked at it half empty, you would have said, \"Well, why didn't that happen 10 years ago?\" The half full is, \"At least it's happening now.\" Deborah Weinswig : Great. And then last question, obviously, with all the work that you've done with dunnhumby, et cetera, and with the relationship that you have with the customer, can you talk about how aggressive you are in terms of pushing mobile coupons, what you've seen in terms of customer response and just what the opportunity lies ahead? W. McMullen: Wait. What? You said coupons, but I couldn't quite, Deborah, hear what you said right before coupons. Did you say mobile coupons? Deborah Weinswig : Just in terms of where are you right now in terms of pushing mobile coupons with your relationship that you've had with dunnhumby? And where are you in terms of working with the consumer? And what has been the customer response? W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at -- the usage of digital coupons is significantly higher than the percentage improvement in the download of our apps. We're working with dunnhumby in terms of making sure those coupons are targeted for each customer. And it's -- it's some are at the segment level, some are at the individual customer level. And those would be some of the things that we continually work with and trying to improve. dunnhumby is putting a lot of  resources on R&D today to get better and better at that in terms of targeting overall. And obviously, we're partnering with them to make sure that we continue to improve that. The percentage increases are so big that it really doesn't mean much because it's triple digits, but it's huge triple-digit increases. David Dillon : And Deborah, just to illustrate a point, one of my favorite things on our Kroger app when I go to my own list, and I'm starting to make my shopping list and I want to download some coupons, it used to be I would just get a long, long laundry list of coupons that were available to download. And now, they're in the order of priority based on my actual shopping. And that would be true for any of our loyal customers that would have enough of a pattern to give us that. In that way, I don't have to go through 100 coupons to find the 4 or 5 or 6 that I want. And it's a terrific feature as an example. So we keep making improvements. About every 6 weeks or so, we make improvements in the app, which often is focused on the digital coupons and improving that experience. W. McMullen: And overall, we communicate with about 9 million households on a regular basis, and all 9 million have unique offers based on their behavior. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Priya Ohri-Gupta, Barclays. Priya Ohri-Gupta: Mike, I was hoping you could just provide a little bit of an update on your thoughts around through the timing of issuance related to Harris Teeter, whether that's changed at all given the current market trends? And then, as we think about what you could potentially issue across the curve, you've previously talked about wanting some varied exposure, and given that you just came with 10s and 30s, should we expect more front-end issuance around that? J. Schlotman: Yes, thanks. Relative to the timing, obviously, their shareholder meeting's October 3 and then we'll still be waiting on final FTC approval after that. So we'll gauge where we are in the FTC process post the shareholder meeting and try to time it relatively close to when the transaction would close so we don't have a lot of negative carry. As we said back when we did the 10s and 30s a couple of months ago, we had several calls during that time and we were very open about the fact that if you wanted 10s and 30s from Kroger, you needed to be in this deal because the next issuance was going to be at the front end of the yield curve. It does 2 things. One, it does what you said, gives us exposure across the yield curve, but it also gives us a better maturity smoothing so that we have some debt coming due every year, so as we need to have the opportunity to pay off some debt to get our ratios at that 2x to 2.2x, we can do that by actually having some debt maturing. Priya Ohri-Gupta: Great. And just around your desire to maintain some floating rate exposure, how should we think about that? Do you have a targeted percentage or amount that you look at? J. Schlotman: Don't necessarily have a set amount. We currently, today, are extremely fixed. We were floating for a lot of this year until we did the bond issuance. In fact, post that bond issuance, you can see in our balance sheet, we have cash invested, which is some of that will go towards financing the Harris Teeter transaction. But I would expect our exposure of floating rates would be either -- it will probably be some combination of commercial paper issuances plus potentially a floating rate note issuance as part of the financing for the Harris Teeter transaction. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Karen Short, Deutsche Bank. Karen Short : I just -- I wanted to focus a little bit on inflation and deflation. Looking back the last time when you saw a deflation, it also happened to coincide with a pretty challenging economic and competitive environment. And if I remember, you were investing pretty heavily in price, so selling gross margin was down pretty materially in that particular time frame. I guess looking into 2014, commodity costs appear to be coming down quite a bit and it looks like there is a potential for deflation. So I guess my first question is, what's your outlook for inflation into next year? And then the second question would be, how do you think about pushing the vendors kind of in the face of the potential for deflation and input costs, because I'm assuming you don't really want to be in a deflationary environment in the center stores? J. Schlotman: I guess your question on don't want to be in an inflationary environment, I can't do anything to change that, so our job is to make sure we can operate in whatever the environment gives us. At this point, I think there'll still be some slight inflation next year from everything we can see. Don't forget, while there are some -- certainly some commodities that are down, things like meat and some of the other categories continue to have some pressures out there relative to herd size and things like that. Now the chicken complex may come in as the corn crop gets harvested. And if it's as strong as it sounds like, that could help. But when you look at the grocery category, which is, in my mind, the one that's most important, we've actually had more inflation in the first half of this year than we had in the back half of last year. On the back half of last year, grocery inflation was under 1%. It was still inflationary, but slightly. And so far this year, it's north of 1% in the grocery category in both the first and second quarter. So I don't think -- I'm not really overly concerned about actual deflation. There could be less inflation, but that's still prices going up. Karen Short : Okay. That's really helpful. And then, I guess the second question I had was just ROIC. Obviously, now that your compensation is tied to ROIC, you commented that ROIC might take a hit near term. And I guess the first question is why, because Harris Teeter's ROIC was fairly respectable. But maybe a little color there just on that comment. J. Schlotman: Yes, I don't know that the comment said that it was going to take a hit. I said that what we're trying to describe is the fact that -- of the metrics we gave last October, it's going to be the one that takes the longest to have upward momentum on because we are increasing CapEx as we do it. And keep in mind, all the numbers we gave today and our expectations and our predictions and thoughts about the rest of the year are exclusive of Harris Teeter. Once that transaction closes, we'll obviously update our expectations as a combined company. But today, we just can't do that. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chuck Cerankosky, Northcoast Research. Charles Cerankosky : Taking a look at your increased comps guidance, which is great to see, in a generally tamer inflation outlook for the second half of the year than maybe we were talking about on the last call, are you suggesting better volume growth? W. McMullen: Certainly -- Chuck, this is Rodney. Certainly, based on what we see today and Dave mentioned earlier, what we're seeing the last 3 weeks or so and a little bit of the last part of the second quarter, we would feel a little bit better volume growth in terms of what our expectations are. Charles Cerankosky : What implications does that have for mix? W. McMullen: Well, as Dave mentioned, the -- we're having extremely good growth in the perishable departments, in those areas of the store and grocery is improving a little bit. So when you look at mix, we would expect it to probably be more driven by the center of the store than the perishables just because of the way we're starting out. Charles Cerankosky : So that would suggest customers doing more of their shopping at your stores? W. McMullen: Well, as I mentioned in the prepared comments, we're seeing good growth in loyal households. And that growth as -- and we have total growth as well. So we would believe we're continuing to pick up a meaningful market share. And it's both in terms of new customers and loyal shoppers spending more with us. Charles Cerankosky : We've seen some of the marketplace stores in our travels, including some with the apparel in them. Can you comment on that group of stores? W. McMullen: Well, the marketplace is one of our many formats in terms of driving our growth. What we're finding is the Fred Meyer folks are helping us identify the right apparel items to have in. And customers are -- it's one more reason to come to one of our stores. Obviously, it's not typically on your Kroger list. But once you're in the store, you can get a great value for some reasonably trendy apparel at a reasonable price. So, so far, we're pleased. And we continue to add it in our new marketplace stores and as we remodel our marketplace stores. Charles Cerankosky : Well, the one in -- maybe it's even open, will the new marketplace in Hilton Head have apparel? W. McMullen: That one, I don't know. Mike actually probably knows that one better than me. J. Schlotman: You're right, it gives me grief that I'm the construction manager for that project. It's actually not a marketplace store. It's about a 90,000-square-foot supermarket. So it will be a big supermarket, kind of like when you think -- if you've been to our Anderson store here in Cincinnati or the Fort Mitchell store, it'll be more along those lines than a marketplace store. The site just wouldn't accommodate a 123,000-square foot footprint. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Todd Duvick, Wells Fargo Securities. Unknown Analyst : Just filling in for Todd here. Most of our questions were answered. But just kind of wanted to circle back financial policy and just more of a confirming question, I just want to make sure I heard you correctly. So ultimately, I guess, everything kind of flushes through over the next couple of years, you'd like to be at 2x to 2.2x on a net debt-to-EBITDA basis, is that correct? J. Schlotman: That's always been our long-term target. We typically, over the past several quarters, have been right around 2x. We were just under 2x at the second quarter. And just in anticipation of the Harris Teeter transaction, we were a little conservative from July 8 when we announced that until now on the use of cash to try to pre-lower that ratio a bit, if you will. We're actually a little bit ahead of where we are. And we feel comfortable we're going to be able to execute on all prongs of our financial strategy going forward, including the 2x to 2.2x. We think that's a good proxy for what it takes to maintain a BBB flat credit rating. Unknown Analyst : Got you. And markets are hard to gauge a couple of months out and I know you have a meeting coming up. But can you talk to where that ratio would be maybe in '14 in terms of kind of a max or any type of range, how you think... J. Schlotman: Yes, I wouldn't -- I'm not going to speculate on where it will be immediately post the transaction. But if you assume a $2.4 billion, $2.5 billion acquisition price and all that debt goes on day 1, it's going to take a full year to add in any Harris Teeter EBITDA. Though the ratio is going to look pretty high on day 1, but by the end of year 1 and you have all of that EBITDA, if you just assume the EBITDA they've been generating, you'll probably get pretty close to a range of what we would expect by the end of the first full year post the transaction. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Stephen Grambling, Goldman Sachs. Stephen Grambling : I know you don't like to give a quarter-by-quarter guidance, but since you did make some references there, is there anything in the fourth quarter that we should be thinking about? It looks like, even as you strip out some of the timing shifts, it looks like it embeds a little bit of a change in trend. J. Schlotman: I'm not sure what you mean by change in trend. I mean, if you look at purely the swing in LIFO, it's a $0.09 or $0.10 per share effect, just the swing of what last year's LIFO credit was and what this year's was or what this year's is projected to be. So it's a pretty dramatic shift between -- just on that line between the 2 years. If you were to neutralize that, I don't think you would -- I think you would find a quarter that's within our guidance range for the year. We've -- the first couple of quarters have benefited from the opposite of that and that we had a higher LIFO charge last year and a higher LIFO charge -- and a lower LIFO charge this year. If you were to neutralize the first and second quarter LIFO charges, our results actually were nicely at the high end of the range, not a 17% quarter like the headline reads, it's probably an 11% or 12% quarter growth, with LIFO neutralized. And that's why for the year, I mean, if you want to say it's a change in trend for the fourth quarter, mathematically, that's how it would work. But that's just because of the LIFO shift. One of the quarters has to be low when we're at 17%, the first 2 quarters in our guidance is 8% to 11% and it's purely that LIFO in the fourth quarter. It's not a change in the base business. Obviously, with raising the low end of our ID sales expectations, it's not any expectation that the business won't be strong in the fourth quarter. Stephen Grambling : Okay. That's helpful. And then one quick follow-up on, I believe it was Chuck's question. Just fresh produce has been highlighted as -- you highlighted it last year as a big opportunity at the conference. And we've also heard some re-emphasis from Walmart, the high-growth specialty players. Can you just highlight some of the things that you're doing that have been driving the growth there? And then, also, more a long term, as you think about the category, how it might be changing either in terms of pricing, the relevance, et cetera? W. McMullen: Well, if you look -- as you know, we continue to add organic produce. We continue to work on shortening our supply chain. Our produce team has done a great job on connecting with local suppliers, which significantly increased the amount of local produce that we have, and we're doing a better job telling the customers about it. So it's really all those things together. From a trend, we would expect that to continue into the future. And on produce, we think we're going to be very strong and successful in produce, but we think probably some of the other companies you talked about, I think there's enough growth that all of us will be successful. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jason DeRise, UBS. Jason DeRise : It's Jason DeRise. A couple of questions. I wanted to potentially get a little bit more color on the FIFO gross margin x fuel, down 11 basis points, if you can share a bit of the drivers within that. And if that is indicative of the range that you think can be maintained as part of the 8% to 11% growth model long term as opposed to what has been happening in the past now that we've got a couple of quarters in there. And then I just wanted to follow up on the guidance change for sales without EPS. Is it just that the share count and interest view for the year has changed since the beginning of the year when -- or since last quarter when that guidance was updated? J. Schlotman: On the gross margin, as Rodney alluded to in his prepared comments, one of the things we've been focusing on, on a rolling 4-quarters basis, is the balance between the leverage of our ID sales, actual cost savings that we achieved and when and how we invest those savings that typically results in lower gross profit. But some of those investments actually wind up increasing OG&A efforts on people via training or something like that, so not everything affects the gross profit. So that gross margin is really dictated on our opportunity to save dollars elsewhere in the organization. The other thing that has helped that and until we cycle some of the bigger ones, clearly, pharmacy gross profit rates are up because generic gross profit rates are higher than non-generic gross profit rates. And that's one of the tailwinds that's in that number which, ultimately, will dissipate. I don't know if that gets to your FIFO gross margin question. Jason DeRise : That helps. By any chance, would you want to quantify this quarter what the pharmacy benefit was? J. Schlotman: No. Jason DeRise : I don't think so. I figured that out. J. Schlotman: That was a good -- it was a good driver. And what was your second question? Jason DeRise : Just about the reconciling that the sales guidance has come up, but EPS is still the same. J. Schlotman: We raised our guidance, EPS guidance in the first quarter, to reflect the results we had in the first quarter. And we continue to post sales essentially just above the midpoint of our current estimate. And anytime you give a range, a company is continually striving to, at their worst, be in the middle of the range and hopefully towards the high end of the range. So it's probably safe to assume that we weren't expecting -- we really didn't want 2.5% sales for the rest of the year to drive the EPS we were giving and really needed sales closer to where we are. And as Dave said, with 7 periods now and the books at 3.3%, for the year to have wound up at 2.5% IDs, that would've inferred a 1.6% ID number in the back half of the year. We just don't see that in the books. We see a number much closer to where we -- we don't see that in the future. Rodney is touching wood by the way. We -- that's our expectation. And I would say it's in the -- both of those are within the range of what we expected when we began the year. Jason DeRise : Okay. And I guess the part of the question that maybe I didn't hear on the first part, is it that the share count and the interest outlook is different than when that guidance was issued at the end of Q1? And I guess the Harris Teeter deal, is that sort of the reconciliation there? J. Schlotman: The share count and the interest have -- the share count a little bit of effect, but not a dramatic amount of effect on the full year. Interest really not, because for the period of time we were drawn on commercial paper until we termed that out a couple of months ago, we actually were lower on interest during that period of time than we expected. So for the year, we'll probably be a little better on interest than the original expectation. And that will actually help offset some of the lower share repurchases that we're expecting for the year. And I'll reiterate one more time, none of our guidance has any assumptions relative to the effect of Harris Teeter. When that transaction happens, we'll have to reset the bar on what our expectations are. But there's nothing in there relative to Harris Teeter. And one other thing I'll remind you about on those is our guidance for the year would also exclude any transition or transaction expenses related to that. So we'll call those out separately as they occur. We had a little bit in the third -- in the second quarter, but nothing that changed the ultimate answer. And again, we still have the expectation that Harris Teeter will be accretive in the first full year. Jason DeRise : Okay. If I can squeeze one more in. With the new stores that you're opening up and I guess some of the remodels that you're doing, how is that progressing at the early stage? Are the stores generating the revenues that you expect? J. Schlotman: We're very happy with the early results in the stores we're opening. It's one of the reasons we're keeping our CapEx expectations and spend where we plan to be. And as we said last October, we expect to increase that a couple of hundred million a year. And I would expect, at this point in time, that 2014 would be a couple of hundred million higher than what we have out there as expectations for this year, again, excluding anything relative to Harris Teeter. Operator : Your next question will be from the line of Andrew Wolf, BB&T Capital Markets. Andrew Wolf : I also want to follow up on the gross margin. This year's rate has improved sequentially quite a lot. And you guys signaled at your last investor conference that, I think, the rate of price investments Kroger needed was going to abate, so you'd need less going forward. So I just wanted to ask you straightforwardly, is that the major driver of the improvement in the gross margin rate, less contraction, to be precise, this year so far? I know you've called out other things like generic drugs, but is that one factor, if not the major one, one of the major ones? And what does that imply about the price environment in general? W. McMullen: Well, if you look, I mean, we obviously have an overall price strategy in terms of our relative price value versus our competition. And we've had that for several years. And we continue to be very aggressively promotionally in terms of giving customers a good value on promotion. I wouldn't overread what this year's number is versus the long-term trend. We're really focused on making sure that we maintain our relative price position. We continue to improve our reputation with our customers. And we balance that with as we take costs out of the business, that we have a slightly improving operating margin. So it's really all 3 of those together. One of the things that's been helpful this year is the pharmacy that Mike mentioned. We're also having good success on reducing some cost of goods on some things that we're doing as well. So that's helping it. The other thing, we probably are investing a little bit more in service this year than a normal typical year. And that's something that, each year, you would balance based on what we see the opportunities in the marketplace. Andrew Wolf : Okay. And I just wanted to switch gears to labor negotiations. There's been some press reports and I think some Kroger officials have commented as well, that with the coming changes in health care in the system, the Affordable Health Care Act, there have been some changes to contract terms. Does Kroger view that these changes to be Affordable Health Care, coming from the Affordable Health Care Act, as something Kroger can use either to -- well, to reach its goal, which you've stated to have the competitive cost structures, particularly, when you think about the industry having one of the most generous health care benefits in corporate America? W. McMullen: Thanks, Andy, for the question. The law really isn't driving -- the changes that you would have read about, the law isn't what's causing those changes. And as you've known Kroger for a long time, we want to make sure our associates and our family have access to affordable health care coverage. And we still are spending about $1.5 billion a year on health care. We would expect that cost to continue to increase even with the changes that you've heard us talk about. Every contract is separate. Every situation is separate. What we find in some cases, our health care plan is so much better -- a lot of spouses will be working. Our health care plan is so much better than a lot of the spouses would have. Spouses are coming to our plan on an increasing rate. And what we're trying to do is to set up where spouses that have coverage, they go to where they have coverage to, in some cases, to take it for that coverage. So overall, we're looking at each contract individually and it's the solution that works fast for that market for that situation. Andrew Wolf : Just to follow up, I think in Dave's preamble, he talked about how growth has -- it sounded like it made a more amicable relationship with the unions. So am I understanding that correctly, that maybe the unions are more willing -- and I know each one is a separate entity, but in general, more willing to make certain helpful changes? Because I know Kroger is expanding and adding opportunity for more membership, for example. W. McMullen: I guess I would never say that the union has been more helpful. I certainly believe the unions -- we continue to have a partnership to try to work together to figure out what's best for our associates. So I wouldn't say that -- they're not becoming suddenly easy to negotiate with. They're still looking out for their members. But when you look at it overall, one of the things that we're able to bring to the table is a growing company that improves job security. We're creating jobs that have -- and obviously, when you're a department head, you get paid more money than when you're not a department head. And it's those types of opportunities that we're able to provide for our associates. So it's really all those things together that will create a growing company, improves job security and improves what somebody makes on an individual basis because they're getting promoted. Operator : Final question will be from the line of Edward Kelly, Credit Suisse. Edward Kelly : I just had really just a couple of follow-ups, I guess. Mike, a question on generics. The pharmacy margin in general and the contribution from generics, I know you don't want to give the amount. But sequentially versus last quarter, how did the contribution compare? Was it similar, less? J. Schlotman: A little less. Edward Kelly : A little less. Okay. And could you also give us an update on shrink? I know shrink was something last year that was a little bit of a headwind. I know you guys have been making some progress. Where do you stand on shrink today in terms of your progress and how you feel about that? David Dillon : Rodney, you want to comment on that? W. McMullen: Yes. Shrink is one of those where -- I don't know that I would ever say I'm ever pleased. We're certainly not satisfied, but we always work -- we're very careful when we are trying to improve our shrink result because it's one of the easiest ways to affect the customer's experience. So we don't want to have low shrink just for the sake of low shrink. We're not as far along as we'd like to be. We're making some progress in some of the areas of the business, but it's one of those things where it's a constant balancing between the pieces. So overall, the answer to your question is we're making progress in some areas. We're still not where we want to be, but we're making sure we do it on a balanced basis. Edward Kelly : Okay. And then just a final question for you. I know you guys recently announced the Harris Teeter deal. What's the M&A environment generally look like today? Are you seeing more opportunity, less opportunity? Just curious as to your general view on what's available. David Dillon : Ed, I'll give you a general comment and Mike may want to add more specifics if he wants. But I think we see the environment pretty much like we've been seeing it, that there's lots of things we look at regularly, but very few of them actually fit things that we think are worth doing and worth spending the money on and investing our time. And obviously, we've described Harris Teeter as one of those companies to merge with them. We've admired them for a long time and it's a kind of asset that really helps us grow into a new market. Do you want to add anything else to the environment? J. Schlotman: No. David Dillon : Okay. So we're going to wrap up and I had just a couple of comments... J. Schlotman: I just wanted -- Paul Heldman was nice enough to point to me in my prepared remarks on, I said corporate brand units were up, market share was 24.5%. It's actually 25.4%. I transposed. I just wanted to correct that before we got off the call. Sorry, Dave. David Dillon : Well, that's good for the record to get that in there. Thank you. So before we end the call, though, as we often do, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates who we encourage to listen in on this call. October is Breast Cancer Awareness month across our company. Associates in the offices and the supermarkets and convenience stores and our plants, distribution centers, participate in many activities to honor and pay tribute to those who are fighting this disease. Including many local Susan G. Komen Race for the Cure and Making Strides Against Breast Cancer events. I'm always moved by the outpouring of support and generosity that I see from our associates at events like these.  In the next few weeks, we'll also begin our annual Giving Hope A Hand campaign to support the fight against breast cancer in our stores. This year, we'll be featuring associates like Lori [ph], an apparel manager at one of our Fred Meyer stores in Oregon, who says, \"Losing this battle is never an option.\" Lori and 20 other courageous women will share their stories of hope and courage on specially marked packages of our corporate brands and national brand products. These items will be sold exclusively in our stores from September 22 through October 5. And I encourage you to read our coworkers' inspiring stories at sharingcourage.com. Well, that completes our call today. We want to thank everyone for joining us. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Q3 2013 The Kroger Co. Earnings Conference Call. My name is Kim, and I will be your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Mr. Mike Schlotman, Chief Financial Officer. Please proceed. J. Schlotman: Thank you, and good morning. Thanks for joining us today. Cindy can't join us today, so I'm going to do the introductory comments. Her daughter, Grace, is actually having an emergency appendectomy as we speak, and I haven't violated any HIPAA rules by disclosing that. Cindy was okay with me telling you why she couldn't be here.  Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.  Both our third quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thanks again to those of you who are able to join us for our 2000 (sic) Investor Conference in New York on October 30. I will now turn the call over to Dave Dillon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Kroger. David Dillon : Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's third quarter 2013 results are Rodney McMullen, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer and soon-to-be CEO; and as you've already heard, Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Also joining us for the call today is Mike Ellis, Kroger's Senior Vice President and soon-to-be President and Chief Operating Officer.  Our third quarter results were quite strong and helped ensure that 2013 will be another great year. Team Kroger continues to fuel our accelerated growth by performing with consistency and discipline. The resiliency of our Customer 1st Strategy to deliver for shareholders and customers was on full display during the quarter even as our internal research shows that customers remain uncertain about the economy.  We expanded rolling 4-quarter FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel and adjustment items. We increased return on invested capital while increasing capital investment, and we lowered operating costs as a percent of sales. And once again, this quarter, our associates' disciplined performance resulted in positive identical sales in every operating division and every store department. Overall, our quarterly results show once again that Kroger is uniquely positioned to grow and win in the U.S. food retail industry.  I am most proud, however, of another distinctive achievement, team Kroger's 40th consecutive quarter of positive identical sales. It is not simply the scorecard that makes this meaningful, although 10 full years without skipping a beat is extraordinary. What makes 40 consecutive quarters of positive identical sales so remarkable is the underlying importance of the metric. For retailers, identical sales are the strongest indication of whether or not we are connecting with our customers over time. Every one of our 343,000 associates deserves recognition for their individual work to achieve this unprecedented milestone. Congratulations. I know our entire team is hard at work to achieve the 41st.  We are pleased with where our business is trending, pleased with the growth of our loyal households and pleased with our business during the Halloween and important Thanksgiving holiday, all of which give us confidence that we will achieve our full year earnings per share and identical supermarket sales guidance. Looking forward to 2014, we expect our earnings per share growth rate to be 8% to 11%, excluding the effect of the Harris Teeter merger and tax benefits, which is consistent with our long-term growth objective. I'll now hand off to Rodney for more details on the third quarter performance and consumer sentiment. Rodney? W. McMullen: Thank you, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Our associates did a terrific job executing our Customer 1st Strategy in the third quarter. We improved our connection with customers, especially our most loyal shoppers and are receiving more credit from our customers because of our strong progress to improve our fresh products and customer service. As you know, these areas are important aspects of our 4 keys.  Before we discuss our loyal customer growth for the quarter, I want to highlight that Kroger has consistently grown loyal households for the last -- the past 10 years. We estimate that since 2003, loyal households have increased by an outstanding 83%. That means today, compared to a decade ago, 83% more households are shopping with greater print [ph], purchasing more items from our stores. Focusing on our most loyal customers has been a real key to reaching 40 consecutive quarters of positive identical sales.  In the third quarter, we continued to grow the number of loyal households, and our loyal household count grew at a much faster rate than total household growth, which was also up for the quarter. We have a tremendous opportunity to increase their spending across our family of stores because on average, we only capture $0.50 of every $1 loyal customer spend on products we sell. In the third quarter, loyal customers drove total sales gains in line with our strategy.  Our strong identical sales in the quarter were largely driven by the increases in total and loyal households. Total units in the quarter were up compared to last year, although items per trip continues to trend down as it has for the last couple of years. We believe this is a reflection of changes in shopping patterns that began with the economic downturn and have now become the norm. We estimate the rate of product cost inflation at 1.5%, excluding fuel and pharmacy.  As Dave mentioned earlier, we had positive identical sales in every department. These sales were exceptionally strong in produce and natural foods. These gains confirm that our Customer 1st investments in our products are working as intended and creating sustainable competitive advantages for Kroger.  We continue to invest to meet our customers' health and wellness needs, and this is evident in our pharmacy and the Little Clinic businesses. We are very pleased with the strong gains we've made when our pharmacy team seized the opportunity created by the dispute between Walgreens and Express Scripts, and even more pleased with the scripts that we've retained. By nearly every measure, our pharmacy team took advantage of that opportunity and ran with it. The Little Clinic likewise continues to see strong growth. Many of our customers are feeling the stress of an economy that is only slowly improving, and they are not immune to the episodic ups and downs that create uncertainty. There are a number of factors impacting an already fragile consumer sentiment, including government gridlock, various concerns about health care, and it remains to be seen how the reduction in SNAP benefits will impact the entire U.S. retail industry. We continue to see high variability in sales comparisons between days and weeks.  What little economic recovery there is remains bifurcated. For some of our customers, the economy is markedly improved. But for others, there are no -- there has been no noticeable improvement at all. While these factors are creating more uncertainty than we normally have, we have never been more confident in our business model and we continue to gain market share. This is because of the remarkable consistency of our Customer 1st Strategy. No matter the environment, our customers and shareholders can depend on Kroger to deliver value. Our ability to make constant adjustments based on what we see in the environment and what our customers are facing has defined Kroger, in our customer's eyes, as a place they can rely on in good times and in tough times.  We continue to personalize and merchandise in ways that solve for the needs of all of our customers. For the customer under stress, we are offering low entry price point on key items and special low prices on seasonal items, especially in corporate brands. And for all our customers are -- and all our customers are benefiting from better service and more value through lower prices on organic and natural foods, including Simple Truth, as well as our digital promotions, fuel rewards and health and wellness offerings.  Corporate brands continued to gain market share during the third quarter as well, with corporate brands representing approximately 26.1% of total units sold, and sales dollars were 24.1%, excluding fuel and pharmacy. Kroger leveraged operating expenses in the third quarter, as associates did a good job controlling costs and driving positive identical sales. Our OG&A costs are -- costs plus rent and depreciation without fuel and the adjustment items for 2012 and '13 decreased 27 basis points as a percent of sales compared to the prior year. We are on track to deliver our ninth consecutive year of leveraging operating costs.  Before I turn it over to Mike, I want to provide a brief update on labor relations. Our store associate ratified new labor agreements covering stores in Little Rock, Dallas and Seattle. We are currently negotiating our contract in Cincinnati, which is on extension until March 1. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face.  Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, should have a shared objective, growing Kroger's business and profitability, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities, plus enhance job security for all associates. In fact, over the last 5 years, we have added 33,000 jobs. Now Mike will offer more detail on Kroger's third quarter financial results and our guidance for the year. Mike? J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and once again, good morning, everyone. Total sales increased 3.2% to $22.5 billion in the quarter compared to $21.8 billion for the same period last year. We know there are estimates out there that are higher than our total sales, but it's important to keep in mind that the retail price per gallon of fuel was down 8% for the quarter. This is why we look at sales excluding fuel, which increased 4.7% in the third quarter over the same period last year.  Net earnings for the third quarter totaled $299 million or $0.57 per diluted share. Both the current and prior year quarters benefited from certain adjustments. This year's third quarter includes a net $0.04 per diluted share benefit that is comprised of $0.05 from certain tax items, partially offset by expenses related to Kroger's pending merger with Harris Teeter.  Last year's third quarter included a $0.14 per share benefit from a settlement with Visa and MasterCard and from a reduction in the company's obligation to fund the UFCW consolidated pension fund created in January of 2012. Excluding these adjustments, earnings per share would have been $0.53 per diluted share in the third quarter this year and $0.46 per diluted share in the third quarter last year.  FIFO gross margin, including fuel, was 20.57% of sales in the third quarter. Excluding retail fuel operations, FIFO gross margin decreased 25 basis points from the same period last year. The company recorded a $13 million LIFO charge during the quarter compared to a $15 million LIFO charge in the same quarter last year. The company continues to estimate its full year LIFO charge at $55 million. FIFO operating profit margin, excluding fuel, the 53rd week last year and the adjustment items in fiscal 2012 and 2013 on a rolling 4-quarters basis increased 11 basis points. On this basis and for the full year, we can continue to expect our non-fuel FIFO operating margin to expand slightly.  Turning now to retail fuel operations. We disclosed many items with and without fuel due to its effect on operating cost and gross rates, but we view fuel as a core department that is expected to contribute to earnings per share growth. About 1/2 of our supermarkets have fuel centers today. In the third quarter, our supermarket fuel centers' rolling 4-quarter margin per gallon was approximately $0.141 compared to $0.133 a year ago. Total gallons sold showed solid growth.  We increased our return on invested capital on a rolling 4-quarter 52-week basis, recording a 13.42% return on invested capital this year compared to 13.34% during the same period last year. As we increase capital, it will be more difficult to grow ROIC in the near term. However, as these investments mature, we expect them to be accretive to ROIC. Our planned uses of cash remain unchanged : maintain our current investment grade debt rating; repurchase shares; have a growing dividend; and fund increasing capital investments. Net total debt was $8.2 billion, a decrease of $525 million from a year ago. On a rolling 4-quarter 52-week basis, Kroger's net total-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio was 1.86 compared to 2.08 during the same period last year.  During the quarter, Kroger repurchased 3.6 million common shares for a total investment of $148 million. Over the last 4 quarters, Kroger has returned more than $752 million to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends as a result of our strong financial position. Capital investment, excluding purchases of leased property, totaled $641 million for the third quarter compared to $474 million for the same period last year. Year-to-date, we have spent $1.8 billion. We expect full year capital investments to be approximately $2.4 billion.  As you know, we plan to continue increasing capital investment over time. This will take the form of adding square footage in markets where we believe our business model is already resonating with customers. With a better presence, we can grow our market share and ROIC. This fill-in strategy is a continuation of efforts that have been underway for some time and include a new focus on markets such as Dallas, Texas and the state of Michigan.  Stores we have opened in the earlier fill-in markets are producing results in line with our expectations, giving us the confidence to add new fill-in markets. Additionally, we will continue to narrow our focus on markets where we do not currently operate, with the intention of selecting one to enter organically.  Next, I would like to update you on our pending merger with Harris Teeter. To say we are excited about the prospects of our companies joining together would be an understatement. We know this is going to be an outstanding combination that will benefit our customers, associates and shareholders.  The merger is proceeding as planned. Both Kroger and Harris Teeter are having productive conversations with the FTC staff. We believe we are still on track to close the transaction before the end of Kroger's fiscal 2013. Now I'll update you on our guidance for the remainder of the fiscal year. For the fourth quarter of 2013, Kroger expects identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of approximately 3% to 3.5%. Excluding certain tax items and expenses related to our pending merger with Harris Teeter and assuming a LIFO charge consistent with our current estimate, we expect EPS to be up -- for the year, to be up in the range of $2.73 to $2.80. That's our current range. This is consistent with our long-term growth rate guidance of 8% to 11% based on our fiscal 2012 adjusted earnings per share of $2.52, and shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend that we expect to grow over time. While these are fairly large ranges with one quarter to go, several factors, including the reduced SNAP benefits, a shorter holiday selling season and slow economic recovery, make it a little more difficult to precisely predict the fourth quarter. Regardless of where we finish in the range, it will be a very strong year, demonstrating the strength of our Customer 1st Strategy. I want to echo Dave and Rodney's thanks to all of our associates for your hard work to deliver what will turn out to be a very good year.  We do realize such a wide range of potential earnings per share results this late in the year can be somewhat confusing. It could also raise questions about where our trends are going into next year. We remain very confident in our ability to deliver 2014 results in line with our 8% to 11% earnings per share growth targets. This is why Dave discussed 2014 expectations. Normally we would not talk about this until our year end release in March, but felt it was important to be clear about the underlying confidence we have in our team and the future.  Now I'll turn it back to Dave. David Dillon : Thank you, Mike. As you can see, Kroger delivered strong across-the-board performance in the third quarter. More importantly, we demonstrated the consistency of our Customer 1st Strategy to deliver for customers and shareholders alike.  Before we turn to your questions, I'd like to take a moment to thank our investors. As you know, Rodney will become CEO on January 1. While I will continue to serve as Chairman through the end of next year, Rodney will take the lead on the call next quarter. I've appreciated our dialogue through the years. You have made me a better retailer as we envisioned our future. I hope you will continue to invest in Kroger in the years to come. I know I will. I could not be more confident in Kroger's future, knowing that our entire leadership team and Rodney McMullen will guide Kroger to even higher levels of performance. Now we look forward to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Credit Suisse. Edward Kelly : Maybe just the first question to start out. Mike, you talked about the wider range in the fourth quarter. There's not really a wide range around the ID expectation. So is that more around gross margin? And does that say anything about competitive environment and what you're sort of thinking about there? Maybe just a little bit of help on that front. J. Schlotman: Yes, I don't think it's really -- that it's necessarily an increase in the competitive environment out there. It's always been a competitive industry. I think it's really -- the thing that's a little difficult to read at this point in time is exactly what the effect of the SNAP reduction will be. It's early in that process. While it's been a full month with November behind us, it's a little difficult to extrapolate November. With the Thanksgiving and holiday selling season in that month, it's always a big selling season and people always find ways to have a good holiday celebration. That, coupled with the shorter holiday selling season of between Thanksgiving and Christmas, as well as just the slow economic recovery, it's just really difficult to predict. As Rodney had mentioned, we see great volatility of sales by day and by week, and it's just a little difficult to predict exactly where we're going to fall in the range. But again, wherever we fall -- wind up falling inside that range for the year on EPS, it's going to be a very solid year and one within our 8% to 11% guidance. Edward Kelly : And to the extent the economy -- I mean, you sort of hinted that it's harder, but how do IDs look so far in Q4? David Dillon : Let me answer that, Ed, because I'd like to actually give you a little perspective. I want to look at how they flowed through the third quarter and then bring you up-to-date in the current quarter. In the third quarter, they were stronger earlier in the quarter, a little less strong near the end. However, so far in the fourth quarter, we are running slightly higher than the sales guidance that we've just given. But I want to add, I wouldn't read an awful lot into where we are currently because of the unpredictable nature of the things that Mike just described, the calendar, SNAP benefits and the impact of health care. Uncertainty has -- all of those create uncertainty for the consumer, and as a result, create some unpredictability. So we're optimistic, as you can see. That's why I wanted to give you that perspective on how the sales have emerged so far this quarter. Edward Kelly : Is there any way to sort of quantify what you think SNAP has done so far? W. McMullen: So far, in November, you can see where SNAP dollars are down, but customers are substituting and buying with cash that shortfall. So the trend so far for that customer hasn't changed, but the way they're paying for their product has changed. How much of that is at the expense of other consumption items would be pure speculation. As you know, the other thing that's helping the economy and everyone is fuel prices are lower this year than a year ago, so some of that savings or benefit or whatever you want to call, is probably coming from there as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. Steven Forbes : It's actually Steve Forbes on for John today. If we take a look at natural and organic foods, you mentioned the strength this quarter. And I guess, we're just hoping if you can provide some additional color on the current size of that business today. W. McMullen: How do I do this in a way that is helpful for you, but not gives up competitive advantages? It's a meaningful part of our business. And it would be, I don't know, probably our sixth or seventh largest department. But it's by far the fastest-growing department on a percentage basis, and sometimes even on a dollar basis it's one of the bigger departments. I don't know, Dave or Mike, if you can think of any other way to give a little bit better insight. David Dillon : I think the interesting thing to me is we're such a big company and seeing the growth of that inside our company, you hardly are able to see it the way we do. But it's been a fabulous part of our business. We are pleased. It certainly indicates where customers are headed and have suggested that what we're offering, they really like. W. McMullen: If you look at our natural -- the competitors out there that focus purely on natural foods, we would be the second-largest retailer out there on a stand-alone basis by a pretty large margin. We would not be bigger than the largest in that space. Steven Forbes : Okay. Then I guess, if we could just talk generally about, I mean, how you view the market share opportunity, I mean, maybe taking a brand like Simple Truth, I guess, the mature share or how the share develops over time, do you see the ability to get to, say, double the nonorganic categories of overall market share? And then just lastly, if you could just briefly touch on the margin structure and how did that look compared to the more conventional categories as well? W. McMullen: If you look at the market share opportunities, for us, we can easily see how that business could double from where we are today. And if I understood the question right, you were direct at just Simple Truth, but that comment is, when I look at natural foods and organics overall when I make that comment. But we don't see it as something that's a dream to double our business. We actually have a pretty good plan in place that will get us significantly along the way on getting there in a reasonable period of time. The margins on the business, it's still -- it's a little bit better than the margins on the conventional business, but it's not hugely different. And like in produce, you'll see us more and more pricing a lot of the organic items at the same price as conventional certainly in certain markets. So we're driven because that's where our customer's headed. We think the growth there is because customers overall, our existing customers continue to buy more and more organic and natural foods, plus the younger generation buys a higher share in those categories. So we see a huge opportunity and we see it exciting and we have some great products to offer there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler from Kroger (sic) [Barclays]. Unknown Analyst : This is actually Jack Moore [ph] calling on behalf of Meredith. I guess, I wanted to see what your strategy is more broadly around the new markets that you have recently announced investments in, including the Dallas market, the Michigan and Detroit and then also in Cincinnati. And how would you prioritize the kind of acceleration of investment in those markets? And where do you see the expansion going forward? W. McMullen: It's really a combination of several things. It's markets where we see, from a competitive standpoint, an opportunity to gain share because there are certain things that we offer in the market that our competitors may not be offering. We have a good relationship with our associates. And we have a competitive cost structure where we can afford to invest and give the customer a good value and be very strong in the marketplace. So it's a combination of all those things together. It isn't necessarily driven by the economic growth in the market, but we do see, like in Dallas, a great -- that economy there in Dallas/Fort Worth has a huge growth in front of it. Unknown Analyst : And the second question would be, would you consider your strategy to be an aggressive offensive type of strategy in these markets or more of a defensive market share protection? How would you characterize and I guess, maybe more granularly by each of those 3 to 4 new markets that are expanding? W. McMullen: Yes, if you look at the markets you've identified, I feel very comfortable to call all of them offensive. We see great opportunities to get a good return on our investment and grow the business there. So I would characterize as all of them offense in nature. I don't know, if Dave, would you... David Dillon : I not only would characterize it that way, I would even think about it from the point of view of we look at market share more as we can grow our connection with the customer better. I would, and Rodney did the same, is I wouldn't use your term aggressive because that sort of implies you're going to come in and try to stomp on competitors, and that's not the idea. The idea is we attract our customers better, we serve our customers better. That they like what they're having, and that's the relevancy. The customers that we've talked about for so many years. And that's the essence of really of our strategy. So it is definitely offensive and it works exactly like Rodney described. W. McMullen: And the other thing is we have a great foundation of associates in these markets. And by -- as you're building new stores, you create a lot of job opportunities for people to get promoted. And what we're finding is we have a lot of associates that are ready to continue to grow to take on more responsibilities. So it's a double win and our shareholders get a good return because we find there's a high correlation between the higher our market share, the higher our return on investment. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research. Charles Cerankosky : If we're looking at the gasoline business, thanks for the data on that, but as gas prices have come down, what has been the customer response to it? Is it still looking as an important reward? Are they buying more gallons because it's cheaper at a better margin? Can you talk about that a little bit? David Dillon : I'll just mention on gas, as we've said, and Mike or Rodney may want to add to that, but we've said gas is -- fuel is an important part of our business for a variety of reasons. Our gallons were up nicely. We feel -- we continue to feel really good about where we're positioned. But gasoline being a large purchase out of a family's budget, even at these lower prices, is still significant to -- and important to them to have the fuel rewards that we offer. And it's important to have a convenient place to refuel at a really competitive price. I just filled up the last 2 weeks twice at getting $1.05 off a gallon. And I can tell you that even in my case, I smile when I'm driving away from the gas pump. So it makes a difference. Rodney or Mike, do you want to add anything? Okay. Charles Cerankosky : Can you quantify what the gallon lift was in the quarter? David Dillon : Mike, do you want to give any color to that? J. Schlotman: It was mid-single-digit gallon growth. That's total, not IDs because, as you know, we continue to add a lot of supermarket fuel centers in existing markets that cannibalizes the existing stores a little bit. But it's -- we are very pleased with the direction of the gallons that we're selling in a market that's not growing anywhere near that much. W. McMullen: And identicals were positive. J. Schlotman: Identicals were positive as well. W. McMullen: Correct. Charles Cerankosky : Okay. How about the mix of gallons at full price versus the reward price? David Dillon : I don't think we give that out ever, do we? J. Schlotman: We haven't. David Dillon : And I don't think we're going to start now. J. Schlotman: The good news is I'm not even tempted to give it to you because I don't know the number off the top of my head. David Dillon : But thank you for asking. Charles Cerankosky : Yes, I try. On the convenience stores, can you give us a little update on how that business is tracking and some of the, call them, experimental formats, you've been looking at, have been trending? W. McMullen: Well, if you look at the core business, that continues to grow and their consecutive identical sales growth quarters is actually longer than the 40 that Kroger has achieved overall, and they continued with their streak. On the experimental formats, I would say right now, we're continuing to learn a lot. And it's still early in the process and Mike Ellis and Chris Hjelm have actually been heading it up, and we've actually recently restructured some of our internal operation structure to get more focus on it. I could tell you we still remain excited about the opportunity, but we haven't found something that I think our shareholders would be excited about the opportunity yet. But we think there's something there and we continue to learn a lot. Charles Cerankosky : Comment on general merchandise sales during the quarter and what that might be telling you about where the customer is headed. And I'm not trying to get in a prediction of holiday sales, but the sort of quarter year-over-year third quarter and how the general merch sales are tracking? J. Schlotman: One of the important metrics would be, as you look at general merchandise, probably the best metric would be the Fred Meyer Group had an outstanding Black Friday. By the end of that day, they were very pleased with the ID sales growth they had, not important holiday for the general merchandise merchants. And they feel like they're set up very well to have a strong holiday season. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : And Dave, congratulations. David Dillon : Thank you. Scott Mushkin : We're going to miss you on the calls. David Dillon : Thank you. Scott Mushkin : But enjoy your retirement and your grandkids. So I guess, I want to go back to what Ed was focused in on in the first question. Because if I -- and I really appreciate, Mike, you giving us some kind of thought process on the fourth quarter. But I guess what pops into my head is kind of what's changed? In other words, kind of new about SNAP. And I mean, when we were at your Analyst Day, we also -- I think I asked about the days that were going to go missing and we kind of knew about it. So I guess, what I'm trying to understand, it seems like you're a little bit more cautious about the fourth quarter, generally. I just wanted to understand what's kind of maybe changed in your -- even though your sales are running, I guess, over 3.5% right now. So what's changed? David Dillon : Let me add a comment or 2 and then Mike can add to that, Scott. The thing I think I want to emphasize is that we see the world as a little more unpredictable than it generally is. And the SNAP change that occurred, certainly, we knew at the investor conference what was going to happen but we didn't know what the outcome would be and we still don't actually know the outcome, and that's what makes it unpredictable. And the more we think about it, we think it's -- there's a lot of ways in which it could be played out. We still believe, as we did in the investor conference, that customers' eating is a high priority, and so customers will tend to substitute other forms. So they'll pay in cash or credit card if they didn't have the food stamps and then they will give up on something else. And at the moment, as I think Rodney mentioned, they've been able to give up on fuel because the price of fuel is so low. But you don't know where that will lie in the longer term and we also don't know how the Christmas holiday plays out. The holiday calendar, of course, we knew that before, too. Now that it's right upon us and we're reflecting on it, we're not quite sure what it means. And then we watch every day the amount of uncertainty that our customers have generally, not just with SNAP and not just with holiday, but you look at the health care and some of those areas that we've discussed. It just created enough unpredictability for us that we felt we needed to take a little more cautious position. J. Schlotman: Okay. David Dillon : Okay. Now, Mike doesn't want to add anything more to that. So I think that's the only reason we felt that way. I don't want you to over-interpret what we've said because I'm actually quite optimistic. Scott Mushkin : Dave, I appreciate that. Is it something that -- because like you said, your business is running pretty strong right now. Is it behavior inside your stores where the week-to-week and what the consumer is buying? Or is it more of even though you guys are taking maybe even more share now, what's going on with some of your competitors... David Dillon : It's actually that when you look at the data, it's a little, it's more unpredictable, more variable than what we're used to. We've talked about this actually for quarters, where we've seen wider swings from week-to-week, especially first of the month and last of the month kind of swings. We've talked a lot about that. But we're even seeing now, in addition to the week-to-week, the daily kind of swings that are surprising. But still in the end, as you can see in the third quarter, in the end, it came out terrific. So maybe I'm over-reading it, but I just think that variability creates unpredictability, and unpredictability means we need to be a little bit more cautious. Scott Mushkin : That's terrific. And then if I could ask one about gross margins and kind of what your thought process vis-a-vis inflation, so I guess, kind of a 2-part question. I think you guys said about 1.5%. Where do you think that's going? And do you think we've had deflation before and people freak out thinking that something is wrong and tend to overinvest in price on top of it? Is that a concern and where do you think the inflation is going? And then I'll yield. J. Schlotman: Yes, you bet, Scott. Thanks. From an inflation standpoint, when you look at where -- let's just talk about the grocery categories since that's just such a big percentage of our sales. It's fairly remarkably consistent in the first, second and third quarter, all a little bit above 1% inflation. You look at individual periods inside there, and there's a little bit of variability, but it's been fairly consistent inflation in that grocery category. Some of the perishable categories have had a little bit more inflation during the year, causing that overall index to be a little bit higher. We really haven't experienced deflation and aren't predicting a deflationary environment for next year. Our expectation as we end this year and go into next year is probably inflationary pressure is about the same where we are today, a very low inflationary kind of period, which is a period we operated in for a very long period of time. There was a very long period of time until the last 3 or 4 years where there is virtually no inflation, and in some of those years actually had deflation. So we're comfortable with our ability to continue to execute and operate in this environment. One of the things that does cause us frustration when you see problems with inflation is when there's big variability in an inflation from inside every year from high inflation to deflation and swinging back. Those have been the periods of time where it's been difficult to manage through. But a consistent, little more than 1% in grocery. Yes, life's a little better with a little more. But when it's consistent, it's significantly easier to operate in that inconsistent environment. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth from Jefferies. Mark Wiltamuth : Wanted to get into a little bit what categories are working because it seems like if you look at Nielsen data and some of the other areas out there, the center of the store seems weak for the rest of the industry, yet you're saying all of your categories were still showing good IDs. So maybe if you could tell us color on the center of store versus the perimeter? David Dillon : Well, Rodney may want to add some color to this, but we've identified some of the strong growth areas that we have better than our average sales, places like produce, natural food. I don't think we've mentioned. Well, we did mention pharmacy. It's also true in deli and seafood. But -- and natural food has a number of items that are within the center of the store so that would be partially part of your answer. We're also seeing a really strong or improved trends anyway and very strong in some, but the categories that are more discretionary, which illustrates the bifurcated nature of the economic recovery, things like Starbucks and sushi and Boar's Head and some of the upscale cheese. Greeting cards are doing reasonably well and toys are too, both of which are in the center of the store. And Rodney, you may want to add some more color to where you see that. W. McMullen: No, I would agree. If you look at -- it's kind of hard how you define center store anymore. Dave's comment about natural foods is one where I always struggle with because technically, it probably is center of store. That would be -- the center store is the weaker part of our business, but it has been for a long period of time because people are buying more and more -- they want dinner prepared and they just come in and pick something up. So there's all kinds of shifts going on, but we continue to gain good share in what business is there. And it really is just moving -- adapting as the market changes. And Mike reminded me that grocery units continue to grow, so it's still positive. Don't take too much into what I said. David Dillon : Yes, and the important note is that we sell both. W. McMullen: Well, it's really important to be positioned to take advantage of both because it's left up to the customer what they want versus us trying to force them. Mark Wiltamuth : And if you dig in a little bit on that natural food category, are you still adding aisle space and SKUs to that area or is it really just more higher turns of existing products? W. McMullen: It's a good question and it's really both. We continue to -- there's a lot of product innovation in those areas, so you find a lot of good new products that you can add that customers like. We continue to find subcategories within it that we haven't had in the past that's doing very well that we continue to add. Plus if you look at the base business, it just continues to grow. So you have all those things happening. We are continuing to add space to those, to that department when you look across the company. Mark Wiltamuth : And are those more focused on your upscale stores or is this actually creeping more into some of the core stores also? W. McMullen: This would be all stores. The amount of it would be different. But a value store would have changes as well. It isn't focused just on upscale by no means. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Wolf from BB&T Capital Markets. Andrew Wolf : Dave, I just want to add my congratulations on everything you've achieved in the last 10 years or so at Kroger. David Dillon : Thanks, Andrew. Andrew Wolf : A couple of follow-ups. First, at the end of the quarter, when things got weak, could you tie that or would you tie that to using focus groups or your own intuition or whatever, to the uncertainty around the government shutdown? Do you think that was the primary reason October sort of softened for your business? David Dillon : Well, my intuition says it was a variety of things. There was a modest change in the calendar in such a way that, that might have affected it a little bit. I think that there was some differences in our own merchandising from last year to this year, not a lot, but enough that you could maybe see a little difference in it. And then third is the point you raised is I think there were a lot of unpredictable things going on and causing people to be uncertain. I know for sure that in some retailers, you could see a clear change in sales performance when the government was shut down because of the wildly uncertain market that created for some people. And the categories that were within that retailer would have been within our store, and we didn't see quite [indiscernible] and we certainly didn't see that kind of a variation in our total sales or even any one department. But I think each of those things go together, conspire together to create what I think is probably going to be an anomaly. But it illustrated to me how unpredictable some of these events may be. And that's probably what makes me a little cautious. It doesn't make me negative, it makes me cautious about predicting, not cautious about what the future will actually be. That's why I emphasized I'm actually quite optimistic. Andrew Wolf : Yes, I think that's a good segue into my real -- my primary question, which is around the sort of ongoing implementation of the Affordable Care Act and the kind of machinations it's changing and as it's going -- the rules that are coming out and all that's going on. So we've had our conference recently. It seems to be, especially from the corporate viewpoints, creating a lot of consternation about the consumer, about take-home checks, are those going to change January 1 materially, and really about corporate cost structure. So sure you guys have put a lot of time and energy into this. I know there's a lot of uncertainty around it. But I wonder if you could just share with us right now and I know this will change over time kind of your best thinking around the consumer, what it's going to mean for the consumer and what it could mean for Kroger's cost structure. Maybe it's a positive thing relative to nonunion businesses, but I'd just like to hear what you think about that. David Dillon : Well, I have a couple of thoughts and recognizing it's early and as you point out, it makes things a little hard to know for sure. But the first thing is that everyone will be affected in a similar kind of a way. I don't think Kroger will be singled out in any particular way either in advantage or disadvantage. And as a result, if it ends up being worse than I'm mentally thinking, then it's worse for everybody than it is -- it's just not Kroger. But also what we're seeing early on so far is our estimates and the way we've played out the future is consistent with what we have been thinking and what we've been feeling, meaning our cost will go up a little bit, it's going to be manageable, it's within the context of what we see as our long-term earnings guidance. And it doesn't change our confidence level at all about what our future looks like and our ability to perform. The short-term effect, the effect on uncertainty and unpredictability for the customer and whether that changes their behavior, that actually could be a short-term issue, it certainly could be a long-term issue too, if I'm wrong. But the short-term issue is more because of the unpredictable nature, does that cause the customer to be more cautious themselves and their behavior. That's what many people felt happened with the government shutdown. And then, of course, once that got back to normal, then a lot of the business looks like it kind of recovered and came back to normal, too. Rodney, I don't know. You and I have talked a little bit about that. You want to add any... W. McMullen: No. No, there are some customers that will probably end up saving money as well. If you were in one of the groups where you were paying more for premiums than under the new structure, so there's some people that's on the other side of that as well. So I think Dave's point on unpredictable in terms of how the customers are going to react, I think the customer doesn't even know how they're going to react yet, because they're still trying to understand what does it mean. David Dillon : Yes. Now, you did mention the union, nonunion picture and of course, we have a number of collective bargaining agreements. And in those, it does create a little, I want to say a little bigger pressure on both parties, on the union bargainers and on the company bargainers, because there's certain changes you have to make because of the law. And when you make those, then that has cost implications and then that puts pressure on the rest of the contract to make whatever other changes you have to make to adjust for that. And I could see the argument that might put a union operator at a competitive disadvantage. I don't happen to feel that way but I can certainly see the argument. Because I think what it really does is it causes the parties at the bargaining table to try to face reality and say, \"How are we going to collectively negotiate this out and compromise this out in a way that works for the law and works for our associates and works for the company?\" And that's been our objective and so far, we've been pleased with being able to do that. Andrew Wolf : I just want to get one follow-up on a question a few folks, including Mark Wiltamuth, I think asked on where the natural food growth is coming, velocity versus expansion. And really, Rodney, I think you said the business could double and I clearly see that that's more than likely. But would you -- could you put a time frame around that, bracket it? Would it be closer to 10 years, closer to 5 years, within which you predict, I know not to the year, but what -- would it be closer to one or the other? W. McMullen: I would say it's closer to 5. Now Mike Ellis is over there cringing because if you -- I would be pushing him to maybe get there a little faster. Michael Ellis : True. W. McMullen: But definitely, I would see it in the next 5 years' time frame. Operator : And your last question comes from the line of Karen Short from Deutsche Bank. Karen Short : ; I just wanted to ask a couple more housekeeping-related questions. On your comp this quarter and also on your gross margin, what was the impact of generics this quarter? Have we finally cycled that completely or are there still some impact on the comps? J. Schlotman: With and without pharmacy numbers, without pharmacy, we were a little bit stronger without it when you take pharmacy out of our sales along with fuel so there was still a slight impact on the ID sales as a result of the pharmacy department. It wasn't [indiscernible] certainly declining. Karen Short : So it should be fully cycled by '14? J. Schlotman: It's not meaningful. It's not meaningful anymore, it's so small. Karen Short : Okay. So the gross margin deterioration that we saw this quarter, now that we've more or less cycled the generic benefit on the gross, is that kind of -- is that our I should think about the gross margin deterioration this quarter? Like it was obviously less in the first and second and then now it's just taking a little bit of a step up, not that meaningful, but it's [indiscernible] J. Schlotman: I would characterize where our gross wound up a little different than deterioration when you look at the cost savings, the total operating cost savings that Rodney spoke of when we look at OG&A plus rent and depreciation, we clearly paid for our investments in gross. And we continue to strive the balance on our rolling 4-quarters basis, the investments we make in gross and the reductions in our cost. And as we've always said, individual quarters can have different results than the full year happens to have. And I wouldn't take one quarter and try to extrapolate that. I would look more where we've been on a rolling 4-quarters basis or on an annual basis so far this year. Karen Short : Okay, that's helpful. And then looking at your CapEx, you brought your CapEx spend up to the high -- well, to the high end of the range, but it seems like the projects that you have, have kind of remained unchanged. Anything to point to there because it was $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion? J. Schlotman: Well, just that we -- where we sit today, having spent $1.8 billion year-to-date, it's more likely than not that we're going to be in that $2.4 billion range. When you look at the number of projects, the major projects may not be appreciably different as a result of that. We're doing a lot of smaller remodels that don't fall into the major project category. Plus we're having a lot of spending in 2013 on 2014 projects, so we can get them opened earlier in the year. And that is something we continually work on, is to not look at those budgets necessarily that you budgeted to open in '14. So spend all your dollars in '14. So there is quite a bit of pre-spend on 2014 openings. Karen Short : Okay. And then last question is when you actually close on Harris Teeter, will you provide updated guidance at that time or are you going to wait until you report your fourth quarter? J. Schlotman: My view is that considering that it will be by the end of our fiscal year, which means by the end of January, we'll probably take February to sit down with them. It's a little difficult today to have even conversations with them about what their business plans should look like next year relative to the FTC will be concerned. We're trying to run their business and we haven't closed on the merger. So my expectation is we'll take the month of February to sit down with the management team at Harris Teeter to solidify jointly what their business plan should look like for 2014 and then give combined guidance when we release earnings for the full year in March. W. McMullen: But the accretion for the first full year would be consistent with what we talked about before. J. Schlotman: Absolutely, there's nothing that we know of or would expect to know of that would cause the $0.06 to $0.09 to be different. David Dillon : Yes, great, Karen. Thank you very much. And before we end the call today, I would like to share some additional brief thoughts with our associates, who we encourage to listen. 10 years of positive identical sales growth is simply amazing, and I'm proud to be a part of an organization that is committed to serving our customers and enriching the lives of others. As I've said earlier, each of us had a role to play in reaching this milestone. It is one you should each be proud of. And thank you all for what you do to make our stores the best place in which to shop during the holidays. Remember the little things like a smile and a friendly greeting always make a customer's day better. And actually, they make our day better, too. I hope each of you celebrate the holidays with family and friends. We wish you Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. That completes the call today. Thank you all for joining us. Operator : This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Cindy Holmes, Director of Investor Relations. Please proceed, Ms. Holmes. Cindy Holmes : Thank you, Glenn. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.  Both our fourth quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Rodney McMullen, Chief Executive Officer of Kroger. Rodney? W. McMullen: Thank you, Cindy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's fourth quarter and full year 2013 results are Mike Ellis, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our associates continue to execute our accelerated growth plan, resulting in a great quarter and a full year we are proud of. Kroger is delivering on the key performance targets we committed to when we outlined our long-term growth strategy at our October 2012 investor meeting. Mike Schlotman will give more details about each of the 4 metrics, but I'd like to share the highlights. We achieved our 41st consecutive quarter of identical supermarket sales growth. We expanded our rolling 4-quarter FIFO operating margin excluding fuel. We improved our return on invested capital even as we increased capital investments, and we increased our market share in 2013.  For the full year, we continue to perform for shareholders by delivering adjusted earnings per share growth of 13%. We achieved our ninth consecutive year of reducing operating expense as a rate of sales, and we returned 600 -- or $928 million to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. That we accomplished all of this while also successfully completing our merger with Harris Teeter is a great testament to our associates' determined focus on serving our customers. We are confident that 2014 will be a great year and that we will continue to deliver growth that investors can count on. Consistent with what we've been saying for the last several years, we expect the economic recovery in 2014 to remain fragile and uneven. Things will continue to get better for some customers, while others remain under economic stress, and we are doing all we can to help. For customers focused on their budget, we continue to offer low entry price points on key items, especially in our corporate brands portfolio.  If you look at our SNAP households during the fourth quarter, they increased their total monthly spending in our stores for each of the 3 months since the benefit reductions took effect compared to the prior year. What we saw play out in the fourth quarter was what we anticipated, that SNAP customers spent more of their own cash on food. All of our customers are benefiting from our relentless focus on friendly service and fresh products, including our organic and natural foods and our own unique brands like Simple Truth. We have a lot of room to grow because the overall industry in which we operate in is expanding. We continue to improve our connection with customers across the entire spectrum. Whether value, mainstream or upscale customers, we are competitively positioned to deliver the right value proposition, and our customer insights help us to focus on the right opportunities for growth in each segment, so that we will capture more of the share of the massive food market.  Now I'll turn it over to Mike Ellis to outline our operational performance. Mike? Michael Ellis : Thanks, Rodney. Good morning, everyone. We continue to have opportunity with our low customers because on average, we capture $0.50 of every $1 they spend on the products that we sell. This figure has remained steady due to the effect that new households have on this calculation. As we told you in December, our loyal household count has increased by an outstanding 83% over the past decade. We do, however, see incrementally more spending from our mature loyal households.  During the fourth quarter, we continue to grow the number of loyal households and at a much faster rate than total household growth, which was also up for the quarter. We continue to improve our friendliness, product freshness, shopping experience and price perception in our customers' eyes. As you know, we closely tracked these 4 keys against our competitors. What we have been tracking internally is consistent with the independent American Customer Satisfaction Index released last month, which reported steady improvement in Kroger customer satisfaction. Inflation was low in the fourth quarter. We expect inflation to be low in 2014 as well, which is reflected in our identical store sales guidance for the year, which Mike Schlotman will talk about shortly. A key driver of growth is our commitment to Customer 1st innovation. As you know, we have done a lot of innovative things over the past couple of years to create unique competitive advantages for Kroger, like our faster checkout initiative. Each quarter, we will highlight one or more innovations that improve our connection with customers and improve our market share. This quarter, I will highlight corporate brands and digital.  Corporate brands continue to be leading differentiator for Kroger. We introduced 937 new products in fiscal 2013, including 100 new Simple Truth items. Simple Truth continues to grow at an astonishing pace, and we now expect it to reach $1 billion brand status by the end of fiscal 2014.  Corporate brands continue to gain market share during the fourth quarter, with corporate brands representing approximately 27.2% of total units sold and 24.4% of our sales dollars, including pharmacy and fuel. We recently announced the exciting new acquisition of our digital coupon marketing provider, YOU Technology. We believe that YOU Tech has strong growth potential and will, over time, become the leading digital coupon provider for U.S. retailers, not just Kroger. YOU Tech has helped us reach another digital milestone recently. We began offering digital coupons in early 2010 and within 3 years, our customers had downloaded 500 million digital coupons. Customers download the next 500 million in only 14 months. In fact, at approximately 5 :57 p.m. Eastern Time on February 6, a customer downloaded Kroger's 1 billionth digital coupon. It was an exciting moment for us and one that demonstrates the growth and customer acceptance of our digital efforts.  Now I will provide a brief update on labor relations. We're currently negotiating contracts in Cincinnati, Atlanta and Southern California. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, should have a shared objective, growing Kroger's business and profitability, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for all of our associates. In fact, we added more than 7,000 jobs last year and more than 40,000 jobs over the last 6 years. Those numbers are even larger when you include Harris Teeter's more than 25,000 associates.  Now Mike Schlotman will offer more detail on Kroger's growth metrics and financial results, as well as our guidance for 2014. Mike? J. Schlotman: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. We exceeded our expectations for the quarter and the year, thanks to our associates performing to deliver growth. We continue to implement our long-term growth strategy, which includes targeting capital to grow our business in new and existing markets, leveraging customer insights to solve varied customer needs through both traditional and digital channels and continuing our share buyback program. As Rodney mentioned earlier, when we outlined our accelerated growth strategy at our October 2012 investor conference, we also identified 4 key performance targets for shareholders to measure our progress. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the results in each metric.  Our first metric is identical supermarket sales without fuel. We are very pleased with our fourth quarter ID sales growth of 4.3%. This strong performance was supported by ID sales growth in every department and every supermarket division. We continue to see outstanding double-digit identical sales growth in our natural foods department. Our produce and deli bakery departments also posted strong ID sales growth, highlighting our customers' continued demand for fresh products. Kroger's pharmacy department continues to outperform as well. Our ID sales results, in light of the slow economic recovery and low inflation throughout the year, are quite remarkable. Weather conditions across much of the country were a net positive as well. Our team's Customer 1st response to weather events kept our stores open and shelf stock, which coupled with our convenient locations, made Kroger more accessible for customers who flock to stores to stock up before winter storms.  For only 4 quarters adjusted FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel and the extra week, increased by 11 basis points compared to the adjusted fiscal 2012 result. This is a result above our commitment to grow the rates slightly over time on a rolling 4 quarters' basis.  The third target metric is return on invested capital. We reported a return on invested capital, excluding Harris Teeter, on a 52-week rolling 4 quarters' basis of 13.43% compared to 13.42% during the same period last year. As we told you, as we increase capital investments, it will be more difficult to grow ROIC in the near term. However, as these investments mature, we expect them to be accretive to ROIC.  Our fourth target metric is market share growth, which we report on annually. We look at market share the way customers would look at it, where they spend their money. In the past, we use Nielsen Homescan data as our source for market share. We're now using a different Nielsen product, Nielsen POS plus, which includes all point-of-sale data from several competitors and includes all departments inside our stores, except for pharmacy. We believe Nielsen POS plus is a good data -- is a good and consistent source. While POS plus does not include all of our competitors today, it covers -- captures roughly 85% of the items we sell, including most perishable items, which Nielsen Homescan did not include. According to Nielsen POS data, Kroger's overall market share of the products we sell in the markets where we operate grew approximately 50 basis points during 2013. This data also indicates that our share increased in 16 of the 18 markets outlined by the Nielsen Report and was down slightly in 2 markets. Walmart supercenters are 1 of our top 2 competitors in 13 of the 18 markets outlined in the Nielsen report. Kroger increased share in 12 of those markets and declined slightly in 1. The Nielsen POS data is generated by real retailers who report their sales to Nielsen. This includes food, drug, mass and dollar channels. This does not include C-store and club.  Now I'll share our fourth quarter results and fiscal 2013 results. Please note that Harris Teeter is included in the company's ending balance sheet, but because of the timing late in the year, it had no effect on our adjusted fourth quarter or fiscal 2013 earnings. If you remember last year, we gave you details to better understand how our core business performed. This year, we have similarly outlined our adjustments for fiscal 2013 and 2012 in Table 6 of our earnings release. The following results are all adjusted as outlined in Table 6 and exclude the effect of the 53rd week last year.  In the fourth quarter, our net earnings totaled $421.9 million or $0.81 per diluted share. Excluding the items outlined in Table 6, Kroger's adjusted net earnings per diluted share grew 10% to $0.78 in the fourth quarter. We recorded a $9.7 million LIFO charge during the quarter compared to $41.2 million credit in the same quarter last year. FIFO gross margin increased 11 basis points from the same period last year excluding retail fuel operations. Operating, general and administrative costs plus rent and depreciation, excluding retail fuel operations, declined 16 basis points as a percent of sales compared to the prior year's adjusted fourth quarter.  Before I move on to discuss Kroger's full year 2013 results, I'll share some data on our retail fuel operations. About half of our supermarkets have fuel centers today. In the fourth quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.113 compared to $0.13 in the same quarter last year, after adjusting for the additional week. For the full year, the cents per gallon fuel margin was roughly $0.141 compared with $0.14 last year, again, after adjusting for the additional week. Turning now to full year 2013 results, Kroger reported total sales of $98.4 billion in fiscal 2013, an increase of 3.9% after adjusting for the extra week last year. On this basis, and excluding fuel, total sales increased 4.2% over the prior year. Identical supermarket sales without fuel increased 3.6% in fiscal 2013 compared with the prior year. Net earnings for fiscal 2013 totaled $1.52 billion or $2.90 per diluted share, adjusted net earnings of $1.5 billion or $2.85 per share, a growth of 13%.  Kroger's LIFO charge for fiscal 2013 was comparable to fiscal 2012. Strong identical sales and cost controls allowed Kroger to leverage operating expenses as a rate of sales for the ninth consecutive year. In fiscal 2013, OG&A costs plus rent and depreciation without fuel and the extra week were down 24 basis points.  For 2014, our planned uses of cash remain unchanged, maintain our current investment-grade debt rating, repurchase shares, have an increasing dividend and fund increasing capital investments. Net total debt was $10.9 billion, an increase of $2.3 billion from a year ago as a result of the Harris Teeter transaction and due to the timing late in our fiscal year, we realized no incremental EBITDA in 2013 from this transaction. Therefore, Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 2.43 compared to 2.04 during the same period last year. Kroger remains committed to managing its free cash flow to achieve a 2 to 2.2x net total debt to EBITDA ratio over the next 18 to 24 months. Capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of lease facilities, totaled $2.3 billion for the year compared to $2 billion for 2012. For 2014, we expect capital investments to be in the $2.8 billion to $3 billion range, including Harris Teeter. As you know, part of our long-term growth strategy is to increase capital investments over time. This will take the form of adding square footage in markets where we believe our business model is already resonating with customers. With a better presence, we can grow our market share and return on invested capital. We continue to make good progress adding square footage in our fill-in markets, and we have identified others based on various metrics. Additionally, we continue to narrow our focus on markets where we do not currently operate, with the intention of selecting one to enter organically. In 2013, we opened the first stores under our new capital allocation strategy. It is still early, but we are pleased with their performance to budget and expect these and future stores will greatly support our growth plan. During 2013, Kroger purchased 16.1 million common shares for a total investment of $609 million. Since the end of the fourth quarter and through the close of the market yesterday, Kroger has approximately $18.7 remaining -- $18.7 million remaining under the $500 million stock repurchase program announced in October of 2012.  Now I'd like to outline our specific growth objectives for fiscal 2014. Kroger anticipates identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of approximately 2.5% to 3.5% for fiscal 2014. This range takes into account the expectation of low inflation during the year and includes Harris Teeter. Full year net earnings for fiscal 2014 are expected to range from $3.14 to $3.25 per diluted share. This guidance includes Harris Teeter. Growing fiscal 2013 adjusted earnings per diluted share of $2.85 by our long-term growth rate of $0.08 to $0.11 equates to a range of $3.08 to $3.16 per diluted share. We then added the net accretion to earnings from the Harris Teeter merger of $0.06 to $0.09 per diluted share, excluding transition in -- transaction costs, resulting in the 10% to 14% growth rate for fiscal 2014. As you think about early estimates for 2015, we would expect to return to our 8% to 11% long-term growth rate. As we report earnings during 2014, we will not break out Harris Teeter results separately, which is consistent with our treatment of all supermarket divisions today. Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a growing dividend, and we expect Kroger's full year FIFO operating margin rate in 2014, excluding fuel, to expand slightly compared to adjusted fiscal 2013 results.  When looking at our cadence by quarter, we expect the first, second and fourth quarters to be within the 10% to 14% range and the third quarter to be above it.  Now I will turn it back to Rodney. W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike. Being part of a growing retailer is exciting for our associates. 7,000 new jobs last year means not just new team members, but opportunities for our current associates to grow and advance as well. Our business is strong. Our merger with Harris Teeter is going well, and our associates continue to execute our growth strategy. The remarkable consistency of Kroger's performance has shown time and again that serving our customers is serving our shareholders. I can think of no better example than our associates' dynamic response to the severe weather in many of our markets during the fourth quarter. Often, our logistics and distribution teams sped up deliveries to keep stores stocked several days before major storms. Most of our stores remained open even in the worst of the winter weather. In some cases, our associates even welcome stranded travelers in extreme freezing conditions to spend the night in one of our stores. Our customers trust that our -- their neighborhood Kroger will be open and stocked when it matters most, and we couldn't be more proud of the way our associates rose to the occasion.  Now we look forward to your questions. Glenn, you can go ahead and get questions started. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : I just wanted to start with a strategic question. You provided the market share performance and how you do against supercenters. I'm curious, how many neighborhood markets are you against today and what has the experience there been? And how do you think about competitively addressing that format, right, which is basically a supermarket format versus a supercenter? W. McMullen: In terms of the specific numbers, I wouldn't have those. I don't know, Mike or Mike, if you have the specific numbers? Obviously, we have a lot of respect for everybody that we compete against. We would not look at a neighborhood store much different than a supercenter. And what we're really focused on is, obviously, our customer and serving our customers and making sure that we continue to improve the value, but we really don't see the effect much different. Part of it will depend on how close that neighborhood store is to a Walmart -- prior Walmart store as well, affected as well. And then, Mike, anything you want to add? Michael Ellis : Well, we know that there's significant capital being allocated to the neighborhood markets, but as Rodney mentioned, one of our advantages really is our location. We're located within 2 miles of so many of our customers that and convenience and the variety that we offer, we feel comfortable where we're at today. John Heinbockel : And we don't know -- I mean, in the markets we -- over last week with supercenter and your gain in share, you don't know where that's coming from. So that could be coming from -- even a lot of that could be coming from fallout among traditional food retailers? W. McMullen: That's correct, John. And we -- also, if you look at some of the additions that we're doing with natural foods, organic, things like that, so some of the gain in share would be that as well. So it's not just only other traditional supermarkets. John Heinbockel : Okay. And then, well, lastly, what do you think the impact is, in totality, right, the good and bad impact from ACA this year? W. McMullen: I was -- we were looking at each other. When you look at '14, we really don't think at the end of the day it'll have a huge amount of effect in '14. Obviously, over time, it will have an increasing -- increasingly amount of effect. Whether that's a net positive or a negative, I think it's way too early, because obviously, on some pieces of it, it's a positive because it expands people's access to health care, which in our pharmacy business and our health care business is a positive. So I think it's way too early to tell you one thing or the other. We're working really hard to make sure that we try to minimize the effect on our associates as we transition to the new plans. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Meredith Adler with Barclays. Meredith Adler : I actually quickly like to follow up just on what you were talking about now, just to confirm that when you talk about the impact on your associates, it's only the nonunionized associates you're talking about, right? W. McMullen: No. I mean, obviously, with the union plans, we will partner with the union and try to make sure that we minimize that effect, but it's much broader than just only our own health care plans. Meredith Adler : Okay. And then I just want to switch gears and talk about -- I know that you're investing a fair amount of money in North Texas, and that it does include not just building facility stores, but also lowering prices. And I was just wondering if you could talk more broadly about your strategy. I think this is an indication of the -- things you were talking about more broadly, but I wanted -- I just want to talk about why that market and how it's going and what is the new response to lower prices? W. McMullen: If you look at the strategy itself, there would be lots of markets that we would have similar strategies in. It just happens that this one has a little -- it's a little higher profile than some of the others, and why that happens is always hard to say. As you know, overall, we remain committed to slightly improving our operating margins. And as we take costs out of the business, we partner with dunnhumby and figure out a way to give that lower cost back to the customers in ways that matter. And as you know, that's been our strategy for many years, and we continue to do that. And if you look at the things that we're doing in fourth -- that we did in '13, the things we're doing in '14, we're very pleased with the results we're getting, just like we have been for the last several years. I don't know, Mike or Mike, do you want to add anything? Michael Ellis : No. J. Schlotman: No. Meredith Adler : Okay, that actually clarifies things somewhat. And then I'm going to ask a tough question, and I'm not even sure I should ask it. But would you do anything in the world of M&A that would substantially change your balance sheet or the tasks that you have to accomplish in the next couple of years? J. Schlotman: It's an interesting way to ask the elephant-in-the-room question, Meredith. Meredith Adler : I try to be interesting all the time. J. Schlotman: It just doesn't do us any good to comment on potential activity that's out there, so we'll just take the stance of no comment on M&A activity. W. McMullen: That's one of the things. Meredith, the only thing I would add is just remember the model that we've outlined in terms of growing our business for our shareholders doesn't require any type of mergers to achieve. And if you think about the merger with Harris Teeter, the benefit that, that brought to our company, we actually increased the growth rate from the first year. In terms of specifics, I'm not going to get into any specifics. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Scott Mushkin, Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : Meredith, you took my question. So I actually wanted to go to gross margins and a lot of our work is showing you guys priced very aggressively on some of these fast-turning items, probably more aggressively than we've ever seen you. Yet your FIFO gross margins are probably better than we would've expected and continue to push in the right direction. How are you doing this? I mean, one side of it, you're taking huge share, pricing is very aggressive. But on the other side, it seems like you've got some secret sauce here. And I just wanted to have any comments on how you're able to do this. J. Schlotman: The fourth quarter was a little different than everybody had seen and has expected from us. Clearly, pharmacy that we talked about in the prepared comments had a very strong year and was a good contributor to gross margin. It had a nice gross margin increase. Our mix in the fourth quarter was very strong. When you look at just gross margin, obviously, a lot of those fresh categories have a little bit higher overall margin than some of the center-of-the-store categories, so that mix can help. And certainly, the snow helped, as we made the comments on people coming in to stock up before weather events. Typically, when people go on a normal shopping trip, they shop off of their lists. When they come in to stock up before an event like that, they come in to stock up before an event like that, and they aren't really beholden to a list at that point in time. So I would say those 3 were the main drivers of what we saw in the fourth quarter, not necessarily something that's going to continue out into the future. Scott Mushkin : Okay. Then I -- one other question about the guidance. I noticed -- I think you're down pretty low on your repurchase authorization. I think, Mike, you said about $18 million or something or $18 million, $19 million left. How much of the guidance of repurchase activity is contemplated in that guidance? I mean, should we expect a change, I mean, you're -- like you're almost done? J. Schlotman: Yes, a couple things on repurchase activity. We've been a regular buyer of our shares since January of 2000. There have been a few times when we've been out in the market, and most notably, around the White House work stoppage and then when we were blacked out as a result of the Harris Teeter negotiations. But other than that, we've generally been in the market almost all of the time and I would expect going into the future, we would continue to be in the market. Obviously, I don't have a lot of money left to do that with and our guidance, as we just talked about back in October of '12, in the early years of that growth model, it is an important contributor to our earnings per share growth, until those stores, as we talked about coming out of the ground beginning in 2013 start to mature, we will rely on some share buyback activity. To get any more specific than that -- I'm not going to go any more specific. Scott Mushkin : So there is some of that contemplated in the guidance you put out? J. Schlotman: Yes. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Kenneth Goldman : Great. I have 2 questions, let me try and attack the elephant a bit differently. Can you remind us in general what your requirements are or what attributes you look for when you do M&A? And my impression has been that you're not necessarily interested in what I would call turnaround stories that needs some price investment, but you'd rather buy a ready-to-wear asset like Harris Teeter. Is that a fair judgment still? Would you theoretically look at stores that need a little TLC if the price is attractive enough? Just on a general basis. J. Schlotman: Well, even when you look at -- let's just talk about the Harris Teeter transaction. The thing that was attractive about Harris Teeter as a transaction is that it's a well-run company that overall we admired a whole lot. That's not to say -- you only picked off price as an attribute that might need some TLC. What we have not liked over time is poorly run companies, not just one attribute of the company that might have an issue. Kenneth Goldman : That's helpful. Can you maybe just add a little color on what poorly run means to you? J. Schlotman: We're getting close to just -- to asking the question. Poorly run just -- results aren't strong, cash flow is not strong, pick the attributes. Kenneth Goldman : Okay, I hear you. And then other question, can you talk a little bit about how happy you are with center store performance in general? And the reason I'm asking is the shelf's stable numbers that we're seeing from the manufacturing side, just very sluggish across the board except natural and organic and yet we're seeing specialty groceries, right, that focus on fresh, prepared, et cetera, do pretty well across the board. I walked down the aisles of Kroger and Safeway and SUPERVALU banners and I see a lot of meaningful space still being given to cereal, soup and categories in decline. I'm just wondering how long can that last, right? What would it take for you to take a more dramatic change to your in-store footprint, right, so you can replace some of that dry grocery shelving with some room for fresh, prepared, et cetera? J. Schlotman: Well, the core of our business is still a big part of our business. And when we look at space allocation, especially in some of our new stores, you'll find that we are allocating more and more space to perishable, refrigerated and the categories that the customer really cares about. The customer is telling us that's what they're interested in, but we can't ignore the center store and health and beauty care products and grocery that are still a big, big part of our business. But we constantly look at space allocation and make adjustments based on what the customer is telling us they want. Kenneth Goldman : Okay, so no plans to sort of accelerate that shift in space? J. Schlotman: No, I think we're constantly looking at this, the allocation and making changes. If you get into our new stores, I believe you'll see some changes in mix. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America. Robert Ohmes : I just had a few quick follow-ups. First, I just want to clarify, and you guys have probably explained it more than once, but so the SNAP reductions are actually supporting market share gains for you? Is that fair to say? W. McMullen: Well, I wouldn't say it that way. What we're seeing is our SNAP customers continue to spend more money with us, and what they're doing is substituting SNAP dollars with their own cash or on debit or credit card. We believe -- if you look, overall, fuel prices are down to even, depending on what part of the period you're looking at. So we believe some of that has been funded by our SNAP customers spending less in other places and reallocating dollars. So I wouldn't make the direct connection the way you did. We're really focused on how do we make sure that we're giving the best value we can to that customer, along with all our other customers, and they're rewarding us by spending more money with us. Robert Ohmes : Got you. That's great. Second follow-up question, which is the weather and stock-up, any -- did you guys take a guess at quantifying how much that might have helped comps in the fourth quarter in gross margin? J. Schlotman: It's really difficult to say. When you look at weeks like that, clearly, it's a net positive when it winds up happening. But you have days that are up double the prior year and then you have a couple days after that, that are down significantly from the prior year. So it gets very, very choppy. Clearly, with the help, and as I said in the prepared comments or I said earlier in the -- to the gross profit question, the mix during those shops helps the gross profit rate because people come in, really, not with the list like they'd normally do, but they come in to have things deep for the next couple of days. W. McMullen: Robbie, overall, was -- it was helpful, but we did -- when you look at the 2004 expectations, we grew that off of the actual '13, excluding any unusual items. So we did not adjust out that -- any weather benefit. But overall, we do think it was a net positive. Robert Ohmes : Got you. And then last question, I'll let you guys move to the next. Harris Teeter, I'm a personal fan of. I shop there when I'm down south. And is there any other -- you guys have talked about some of the things they do well that you might be able to bring into The Kroger store base. Anything since we last did a conference call that you can update us on? J. Schlotman: Robbie, it's -- the merger ultimately closed January 28. So it's only been a handful of weeks since we've actually been able to roll up our sleeves and have the kind of conversations you want to have when you start integrating a company. That said, we've made a lot of progress in those 6 or so weeks since the merger's been closed. Clearly, one of the things we like is that about -- a little over 160 of their stores, they have what -- it's called Express Lane, we call it click and collect. That's something that intrigues us as -- it's an internet but pick-it-up yourself kind of a process at the store that appears to appeal very strongly to their customer. That's something we'll try to learn from. But it's been a very positive and we're very happy with the start we've had to the integration progress with Harris Teeter. And any surprise that we've seen has been a positive, not a negative surprise, which is always nice. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Greg Hessler with Bank of America. Gregory Hessler : So my question is with the Harris Teeter acquisition, it kind of brought you back into the M&A market where you've been absent for a number of years. And I know you can't comment on market rumors, but internally, has there been any sort of shift or change in the way that you'd look at M&A opportunities? J. Schlotman: No, I'd say it's consistent with how we've always done it. And also, as I said in my prepared comments, our investment-grade rating is important to us and we continue to expect to allocate free cash flow to maintain our rating. Gregory Hessler : Okay. And I think with the Harris Teeter acquisition, you sort of temporarily went above that 2 to 2.2x net leverage target. I mean, how much flex do you feel like you have within the investment-grade rating band? And would you be able -- or would you be willing to even go maybe a little bit higher than that for the right strategic opportunity? J. Schlotman: Yes -- I'm not going to comment on that. And obviously, the only reason -- the reason we're above the 2.2x on Harris Teeter is the shareholders won't wait a year to get their check for the purchase of their shares. They want that upfront. We don't get a year's worth of EBITDA until the end of the year. So it's really just the fact we have all the debt and none of the EBITDA now, and we feel very good about our ability to get back under 2.2x in the time frame we outlined to the rating agencies. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Karen Short, Deutsche Bank. Karen Short : A couple of questions just on your guidance. What is your -- in guidance, specifically. What is your guidance and planned D&A, as well as interest expense? It seems like -- I mean, we can kind of calculate interest expense or incremental interest expense related to Harris Teeter, but D&A was a little bit of a wildcard. So any color there? J. Schlotman: Obviously, from the write-off of the assets for Harris Teeter, the amortization of that will pick up. I don't have that in front of me, and I prefer not to go giving guidance on every line of the income statement. I might as well just hand you my business plan and let the whole world have it, which I think we give as much or more guidance than anyone. So you should be able to back into it just based on the public guidance we've given of what our earnings per share is and the number of lines we've given you. Karen Short : Okay. And then looking at your MEPP guidance for 2014, I think it reflects kind of an 11% increase in the expense. Any color on why that increase is so high. That just seems high to me. J. Schlotman: The contributions into the plan? Karen Short : Yes, the $250 million? J. Schlotman: It's just our expectation. There are some funds in rehab status that -- one of the ways you get out of rehab status is you put a little bit more money in, benefits come down a little bit and over time, it's an attempt to try to get them in a better funded position. It's -- while the percentage is fairly strong, it's not that much incremental cash that we're expecting next year. W. McMullen: And it would be something that we'll work with the unions on to make sure that we try to get those funds in a status that's sustainable over time. And it would be an ongoing negotiation and relationship in terms of the balance between what money we spend on pension, what money we spend on health care and what we're able to do on wages. So it's really all together. Karen Short : Okay, that's helpful. And just on your investment-grade ratings, getting back to that 2x to 2.2x, I guess what I'm confused about is why wouldn't they be looking at the pro forma number regardless in terms of your investment-grade rating [indiscernible] they are? J. Schlotman: Yes, I believe the rating agencies do that, which is why they did not downgrade us when we announced the merger. Obviously, the conversations were -- with them were our commitment to get it back down there based on a pro forma calculation you do for them, and that's what they got comfortable with. So from the rating agency standpoint, they would look at it that way. But from the number I have to report, my number is my number. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Charles Cerankosky : Could you touch on a couple of categories in particular about how they did during the quarter, one would be general merchandise, especially at Fred Meyer and then prepared foods, please? Michael Ellis : Yes, general merchandise, it was such an interesting holiday season with 6 less selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. And predicting our business and building our business plan around that was certainly -- it doesn't happen very often. But overall, the season came out pretty decent. It wasn't as different as we would've thought it would've been. I think we actually came out okay when you figure the changes in by Friday, the differences in the calendar and everything else that occurred. And so in general, I would say it came out okay. Jewelry, for example, for us, had a really stellar quarter, and general merchandise was fairly decent. I mean, I would say it came out okay. But in terms of -- what was the other question, prepared food? W. McMullen: Yes -- and overall, it turned out better than we were expecting when you think about 6 less days and the economy and especially some of the weather in parts of the countries. But overall, we felt pretty good about it, prepared goods. Go ahead, Mike. J. Schlotman: Prepared foods continue to be a growing section of our business for us, so we're committing more and more space and better products all the time to those types of departments and items. So I wouldn't say there's anything really unusual when it comes to prepared food. Charles Cerankosky : All right. And finally, can you give us an update on sales trends, thus far, into the first quarter? Michael Ellis : Obviously, it's very early in the quarter. Right now, we would be a little bit better than the high side of the range, but it's still very early, and we believe the weather has been a positive so far. As we've mentioned, as Mike mentioned in the prepared remarks, when you look at the year as a whole, we expect inflation to be reasonably modest throughout the whole year. But so far, so good. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Stephen Grambling with Goldman Sachs. Stephen Grambling : You did mention the innovation in digital on the YOU Tech acquisition. So can you actually maybe describe some of the synergies that come from that acquisition, what they are maybe bringing to the table that you didn't have already and just the contribution you're expecting there over the next, call it, 5 years? Michael Ellis : Well, I'm not really so sure I can comment on synergies, but we do like what YOU Tech brings to us in terms of the technology and our ability to serve up coupons for our customers in a really meaningful way. And you couple that with dunnhumby, and we think that this really gives us a great platform to communicate better with our customer and provide them both technology and the coupons that they're looking for today. Because a customer can redeem coupons simply by taking their loyalty card into the store and scanning it, and they're receiving the things they want most and getting discounts on those items. Stephen Grambling : When I said synergies, I guess, I meant qualitatively. And I guess, the follow-up would be, as you look at developing this yourself versus making this acquisition, is this just the way to jumpstart moving to maybe even integrating some of the customized coupons to the customer? Michael Ellis : Yes, well, it certainly helped us move faster. And the relationship with YOU Technology has moved us along a lot quicker than we probably would've done on our own. J. Schlotman: Yes, there's multiple levels to it, Stephen. When you talk about customized coupons, today, all of the digital coupons that are out there, there's a sort feature on The Kroger app that allows you to sort those coupons based on the relevance to you of how you shop and what you buy. So rather than having to search through all the coupons that might be attractive, the app basically does that for you based on how you actually buy product. Stephen Grambling : Great. And then I have a quick follow-up to I think it was Ken's question. And you had mentioned last quarter that you would expect the margin on natural organic items to converge over time with conventional. And as I think initially, it may have been viewed as maybe reduction in margin on those items, but given the consolidation in the space and your reallocation of the natural organic to be a little bit greater versus the center store, is there any reason to see the margin maybe even go up on the conventional items over time? W. McMullen: It's a good question. I think it's pretty hard to say. We would not expect that as a general rule and we're really focused on figuring out ways to give the customer better and better deal. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Mark Wiltamuth with Jefferies. Mark Wiltamuth : So Cerberus is one of the parties reportedly looking at Safeway. If you look at their behavior after their acquisition of the Supervalu banners, would you say they were more or less disciplined on price? And how is their behavior in the marketplace as a competitor after the move there? W. McMullen: Obviously, in terms of a lot of specifics, we won't be able to give you that. But we look at Cerberus and Albertsons as a very good competitor, and we're really focused on what does our customer want and then how do we get better about delivering against that. They're a good competitor, but there's a lot of good competitors out there. So probably a little more focused on the basics every day, but I wouldn't say it's appreciable different. Mark Wiltamuth : Okay, so you didn't see any C-change in pricing strategy or anything like that as they shifted there? W. McMullen: No, not to the extent that you would think. It was a completely different person before. They do a better job on the basics. They also will consolidate stores. They ended up selling off some stores, things like that, but it's -- every transaction is different. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Todd Duvick with Wells Fargo. Todd Duvick : Just looking at cash flow for 2014, can you tell us after the Harris Teeter acquisition, whether or not you expect working capital to be either a use or a source of cash? And can you give us kind of an order of magnitude? J. Schlotman: Yes, we continue to do a really good job on our working capital usage. If you look at the consolidated balance sheet, the way we look at it, and it's the balance sheet with Harris Teeter combined into it. We had just about $75 million or $80 million reduction in working capital overall for the year and we still have plans in place of things that we think could continue to improve that. We wouldn't budget in dramatic improvements and have that in expectation of as a source of cash, but we would expect to have some benefit from it. Todd Duvick : Okay, that's helpful. And then I think you also indicated that you expect to contribute about $250 million to the multiemployer pension plans this year, and I assume that includes Harris Teeter. Can you confirm that? And can you tell us if there are multiemployer pension -- I guess, obligations were materially larger than your overall obligations? J. Schlotman: Harris Teeter is not a party or not a member of any of the multiemployer funds. They're 100% employee choice. So I guess, that would be total company, the contributions, but none of it has reflected the result of the merger with Harris Teeter. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Edward Kelly with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Edward Kelly : Mike, my question for you is on CapEx. I don't think it was asked. But your guidance, Mike, looks like it calls for about, I don't know, maybe a $600 million increase in CapEx. I think Harris Teeter, based on what they've shown historically, could be a couple hundred of that. And you know what, obviously, your longer-term guidance was an additional $200 million a year. So could you just kind of help us understand where the increase in CapEx is coming from? J. Schlotman: Sure. If you go back to our December call, we were projecting a point estimate of $2.4 billion for this year. We came in at $2.3 billion. Some of that is just a little delay on some projects that caused it to be a little behind where we expect it. We would expect that catch-up to happen in 2014. So if you think about 2014 going off of a $2.4 billion base, the $200 million increase that we would've expected on an annual basis would get you to $2.6 billion. And then adding in the activity for Harris Teeter, which will probably be a little higher than the number you used, may continue to have some attractive opportunities and their own forecast would have had their CapEx continuing to grow because they were growing their company. That's really how we got the build up to $2.8 billion to $3 billion. Edward Kelly : Okay. And then as we think about sort of beyond this maybe like '15, I -- we probably shouldn't throw $200 million on top of '14 number because of the catch-up, I guess, is how to think about it. J. Schlotman: It's a little early to give 2015 guidance, but for planning purposes at this point, I would be thinking about another $200 million internally. W. McMullen: And Ed, the thing we're really focused on, and Mike mentioned it in his prepared comments, is the incremental capital we're spending, what returns are we getting for that and what's our ability to execute at that higher level because obviously it creates jobs and we have to find associates to staff those stores and run those stores. And as long as we're feeling good about being able to help develop our associates to run the stores and their performance continues to be strong, we would continue to expect to continue to increase capital. J. Schlotman: And as we said, we're coming close to picking a market to go into organically, which will take some capital as well. Edward Kelly : And just a follow-up on that, Mike and Rodney, when you think about a new market, what are the dynamics that you're really sort of looking for to make that decision in terms of where you ultimately go? J. Schlotman: Well, we look at a wide range of topics, including the competitive landscape. We look at where the market may be situated compared to our existing infrastructure. It would be very nice if it winds up being a market that our current logistics and manufacturing systems can supply product to them, again, the dynamics of the market, not just the competitive landscape, but the growth that you see in a potential market. And then some customer research of what it is the customer wants from a grocery retailer and how we have been able to perform against that over time in the markets where we already operate. So it's a very long list of things. Those would be amongst the bigger. Operator : There are no further questions. I will now turn the call over to Mr. Rodney McMullen for closing remarks. W. McMullen: Thanks, Glenn. Before we end the call, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. First, I'd like to welcome our Harris Teeter associates to The Kroger family. We couldn't be happier. I'd also like to thank our associates for your hard work in connection with our customers. We finished 2013 strong because of your hard work to provide friendly service and fresh products to every customer every time, every day. You also helped keep costs under control so we can reinvest the savings in things that matter most to our customers. They are taking note of your efforts and giving us credit for making a difference. Special thanks to each and every one of you for all you do for our customers and each other.  This week, we will host our third annual associate recognition event in Cincinnati. Our 33 associate honorees come from across the company, including our retail divisions, fee stores, manufacturing and logistics facilities, Fred Meyer Jewelry, the Little Clinic and general office. They will be recognized during this 2-day event for their friendly service, strong leadership, dedication to their community and courage in the fight against cancer. Finally, I'd like to say thank you to our Chairman, Dave Dillon, for his leadership and the powerful foundation he and our team have put in place. I am humbled to be serving as your CEO and excited to work with our outstanding leadership team. We're not done serving our customers, growing our business and performing for shareholders. Indeed, we're just getting started. That completes our call for today. Thanks for joining us, and thank you for all you do to partner with Kroger. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Cindy Holmes, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Cindy Holmes : Thank you, Laura. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our first quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Rodney McMullen, Chief Executive Officer of Kroger. W. McMullen: Thank you, Cindy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's first quarter 2014 results are Mike Ellis, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  Kroger delivered an outstanding first quarter. It is a great start to what we believe will be another exceptional year. Our associates continue to enhance our connection with all customers and achieve key performance measures, which are allowing us to achieve our growth strategy. We also achieved our 42nd consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales, exceeded our goal to slightly expand FIFO operating margin without fuel on a rolling 4-quarter basis, maintained a steady return on invested capital while increasing capital investment. We are achieving synergies from our merger with Harris Teeter. Both Mikes will have more to say about this in a few minutes. And we returned over $1 billion in cash back to our shareholders this quarter through our buyback program. The staying power of our Customer 1st strategy and our accelerated growth plan are generating strong momentum. We continue to lower our cost of doing business and to invest those savings both for today's customers and for future growth. Our strong first quarter results set us up to deliver a 12% to 15% net earnings per share growth rate for the year, partly due to the benefit of Harris Teeter, compared to our long-term growth rate of 8% to 11% plus the dividend in both cases.  I'm also pleased to report that we continue to take meaningful steps to restructure and help secure our associates' pension obligations for the future. Through 2 innovative agreements, we plan to move nearly 2,000 associates and retirees to more stable pension plans and 350 associates to a Kroger-sponsored 401(k) plan with a match. We intend to continue looking for opportunities to leverage our strong financial flexibility to safeguard our associates' benefits. We are always looking for opportunities that are good for our associates, good for Kroger and good for our shareholders.  From an economy and customer shopping behavior, we are seeing strong positive indicators in shopping behavior. Our customers have exhibited less cautious spending behavior, for example. Consistent with the rise in consumer confidence index in May, our own customer research tells us that more customers perceive the economy to be in recovery. While it is obviously welcome news, the recovery remains fragile, especially for customers on a budget. We intend to keep delivering value and improving our connection with customers across the entire spectrum. Whether through our popular fuel rewards program, our Simple Truth offerings or a more convenient shopping experience, Kroger is uniquely positioned to deliver on this promise in any economic environment. And against this backdrop, an uneven economic recovery, our team's excellent first quarter performance stands out in even greater contrast.  Now I'll turn it over to Mike Ellis to outline our operational performance. Mike? Michael Ellis : Thanks, Rodney. Good morning, everyone. I'd like to congratulate the entire Kroger team for executing our Customer 1st strategy with precision in the first quarter, which is driving growth and improving our perception in the eyes of our customers. We are connecting better with our customers, showing them we care and making sure they have a great shopping experience every time.  Keeping costs down allowed us to invest strategically and increase customer loyalty. During the quarter, we grew our number of loyal households at a much faster rate than total household growth, which also was up for the quarter. We saw inflation increase in the grocery category during the quarter. This, combined with higher inflation in meat, produce and pharmacy, has caused us to adjust our view of inflation for the year. We estimate inflation excluding pharmacy was 1.8% in the first quarter and 2.1% with pharmacy included. We expect it to be higher than originally anticipated for the rest of the year as well. Even with higher inflation, we saw strong tonnage growth during the first quarter. I'll jump to Harris Teeter. Our merger with Harris Teeter is going extremely well. We are spending time with Harris Teeter and learning a lot about how they connect with customers. Their store standards and fresh foods are world-class, and our cultures are a great fit, which makes our integration work rather easy. We are excited about what we're learning about Harris Teeter's online ordering and store pickup model. It's a program with a lot of promise. A key driver of sustainable growth is Customer 1st innovation. Each quarter, we are highlighting one or more of our innovations that are improving our connection with customers and growing our market share. This quarter, I will highlight some of the new exciting work of our corporate brands and Kroger technology teams. In corporate brands, a strategic differentiator for Kroger's corporate brand portfolio is our multi-tier offering. It allows us to offer the right price points and product experiences for everyone. In the first quarter, we introduced new branding and packaging for our value products, the good tier of our \"good, better, best\" program. The new design calls out to customers with attractive, uplifting packaging, and the response, so far, has been really terrific. For fresh products, we've replaced Kroger Value with Heritage Farm. The name better reflects the inherent quality of the brand, and we are already seeing positive acceptance from our customers. Corporate brands had a solid first quarter, accelerating company sales growth and representing approximately 26.2% of total units sold and 24.5% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy.  Kroger technology is our team of technology innovators and inventors. They are implementing a fundamental foundational technology that we can leverage to create the Internet of Things in the retail environment. One tangible example of this is real-time temperature monitoring in our supermarkets. Today, temperature checks are performed manually by our associates, but by using interactive sensors that are connected through an in-store network, we can better ensure the freshest foods by allowing for more frequent, real-time temperature checks of meat, produce, deli and frozen food products. Now we love these kinds of initiatives because they save money and they free up time for our associates to engage with customers. And most importantly, this technology will help improve our already vigorous food safety efforts. We plan to continue leading the adoption of the Internet of Things in our stores.  Now I'll give a brief update on labor negotiations, labor relations. We recently agreed to new contracts in both Atlanta and Southern California, as well as for nonfood associates in Portland, Oregon. We are currently negotiating contracts with the UFCW for store associates in Cincinnati, New Mexico, Toledo and parts of California and an agreement with the Teamsters covering several distribution and manufacturing facilities. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages to provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, should have a shared objective : knowing Kroger's business and profitability, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhanced job security for our associates. Now Mike Schlotman will offer more detail on Kroger's financial results and update our guidance for 2014. Mike? J. Schlotman: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. We exceeded our expectations for the quarter, thanks to our associates performing to deliver growth. We continue to implement our long-term growth strategy, which includes targeting capital to grow our business in new and existing markets, leveraging customer insights to solve varied customer needs through both traditional and digital channels and continuing to deliver shareholder value through our share buyback program and dividend. When we outlined our accelerated growth strategy at our October 2012 investor conference, we also identified the key performance targets for shareholders to measure our progress. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the results in each metric. Our first metric is identical supermarket sales without fuel. We are pleased with our first quarter ID sales growth of 4.6%. This strong performance was supported by ID sales growth in every department and every supermarket division. We continue to see outstanding double-digit identical sales growth in our natural foods department. Our produce and general merchandise departments also posted strong ID sales growth, and Kroger's pharmacy department continued its strong performance.  Rolling 4 quarters FIFO operating margin on a 52-week basis, excluding fuel and the pension agreements, increased by 12 basis points. This exceeded our commitment to grow the rate slightly over time on a rolling 4 quarters basis. Until we have Harris Teeter in both the current and base years, the expected increase will be higher than our long-term guidance, which is slightly expanding. Over time, we expect our FIFO operating margin growth, excluding fuel, to return to slightly expanding on a rolling 4 quarters basis.  The third metric is return on invested capital. We reported a return on invested capital on a 52-week rolling 4 quarters basis of 13.5%, which is consistent with ROIC during the same period last year. As we increase capital investments, it will be more difficult to grow ROIC in the near term. However, as these investments mature, we expect them to be accretive to ROIC. As Mike and Rodney already said, our integration with Harris Teeter is well underway, and we're achieving synergies in multiple fronts. One great example is combining insurance programs, which has reduced our annual premiums by $6 million already.  Now I'll share our first quarter 2014 results in more detail. Please note that this is the first period that includes Harris Teeter in Kroger's statement of operations. Year-over-year percentage comparisons are affected as a result. In the first quarter, our net earnings totaled $501 million or $0.98 per diluted share. This includes charges related to the restructuring of certain pension obligations to help stabilize associates' future benefits, as described in yesterday's press release. Excluding the effect of these charges, Kroger's adjusted net earnings were $557 million or $1.09 per diluted share for the first quarter. Net earnings in the same period last year were $481 million or $0.92 per diluted share.  As Mike Ellis said, we are seeing higher inflation than anticipated. We recorded a $28 million LIFO charge during the quarter compared to a $17 million LIFO charge in the same quarter last year. We are increasing our LIFO estimate for the year to $90 million. Our previous LIFO guidance for the fiscal year was a charge of $55 million. This affects the year by about $0.04. FIFO gross margin increased 1 basis point from the same period last year, excluding retail fuel operations. Strong identical sales and cost controls allowed Kroger to leverage operating expenses as a rate of sales in the first quarter. Operating, general and administrative costs plus rent and depreciation, excluding retail fuel operations and pension agreements, declined 9 basis points as a percent of sales compared to the prior year's first quarter.  Now for retail fuel operations. About half of our supermarkets have fuel centers today. In the first quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.131 compared to $0.116 in the same quarter last year. Our long-term financial strategy continues to be to maintain our current investment-grade rating, repurchase shares, have an increasing dividend and fund increasing capital investments. Kroger remains committed to achieving a 2 to 2.2 net total debt to EBITDA ratio by mid to late 2015. Kroger took on debt to finance the Harris Teeter merger and realized no incremental EBITDA in fiscal 2013 because the transaction closed late in the fiscal year. This has a material effect on the company's net total debt to EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA ratio, which is 2.42x compared to 1.85x during the same period last year. As we get a full year of Harris Teeter EBITDA in the calculation, we expect to be closer to 2.2x by the end of the year. Kroger's net total debt is $11.3 billion, an increase of $3.4 billion from a year ago. This is a result of the debt related to the Harris Teeter transaction and Kroger's share repurchase activity.  Kroger's strong financial position has allowed the company to return more than $1.9 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends over the last 4 quarters. During the first quarter, Kroger repurchased 25.7 million common shares for a total investment of $1.1 billion. Capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, totaled $709 million for the first quarter compared to $600 million -- $640 million for the same period last year. We continue to expect capital investments to be in the $2.8 billion to $3.0 billion range, including Harris Teeter, for fiscal 2014.  Now I'd like to update our growth objectives for fiscal 2014. Based on our strong first quarter results, we raised and narrowed our adjusted net earnings guidance to a range of $3.19 to $3.27 per diluted share for fiscal 2014. The original guidance was $3.14 to $3.25 per diluted share. The company's long-term net earnings per diluted share growth remains -- our guidance remains at 8% to 11%. Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend expected to increase over time. We raised our identical supermarket sales growth guidance, excluding fuel, to 3% to 4% for fiscal 2014, including Harris Teeter. The original guidance was 2.5% to 3.5%. And now I'll turn it back to Rodney. W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike. What a terrific start to our year. Our merger with Harris Teeter is going exceptionally well. We are learning a lot from Harris Teeter associates, and our business is performing well. And we're even more excited about Harris Teeter's people and the opportunity today than we were when we first merged. Across our company, our associates' remarkably consistent execution continues to generate consistently remarkable results for our shareholders. We will continue building on this resilient foundation to grow aggressively into the future. And now we look forward to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : So a couple of things. Obviously, it's a little hard to tell with Harris Teeter mixed into the numbers, but if I try to back that out and think about x fuel gross margin decline, it looks about what it's been running or maybe just slightly higher than it's been running. And I ask that because I'm curious what you see with regard to inflation today. Is that being passed along fairly quickly? Or given your value position, are you delaying some of that for weeks or maybe even months? W. McMullen: Yes, breaking it out, you would be correct that without Harris Teeter, the trends would be very similar to what they've been running. From an inflation standpoint, we pass it along, some of it in terms of, obviously, how's the competitive environment going and also, inflation that we think is just a seasonal-type inflation or something that's longer term. And I would say in our ability to pass it through, it's pretty much similar to what it's been running. I don't know, Mike or Mike, anything you want to add to that? Michael Ellis : No. J. Schlotman: No. John Heinbockel : Okay. And then as a follow-up, when I think about your price investments, right, and you're \u2013 I don't know what inning we're in, but how do you think about it now in terms of investing by category, right, because I know you made investments in natural foods. Are there more categories where you need that type of work? Doesn't look like there is. Or is it solely items? And then how do you think about private label, price investments in private label? And when you think about that, do you look at the private label spread versus the brand, or do you actually go out and look at what other retailers are retailing their private label products at? W. McMullen: Well, the first question on overall price investment, we're continuing to look at the markets we do business in and deciding where we want to be positioned. Also, we look at categories within the store and try to determine where we want to be priced relative to competition or the market. But private label, there's several ways we look at private label pricing. One would be how it's related to the branded product. And in some cases, it might be priced with the competition in a way that keeps us on our pricing strategy and keeps us relevant. It really depends upon the item and the market. John Heinbockel : But do you think -- we're talking about items now. Most of your category adjustments have been made, or do you disagree with that? W. McMullen: We've been through most categories and made some sort of adjustments over the last several years in pricing, but we're still looking at pricing overall and where we're positioned and making decisions on where we want to be. Operator : And the next question will come from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Kenneth Goldman : Forgive me if you mentioned this. Can you estimate, even if it's just a rough number, what weather's tailwind was on your comps in 1Q? W. McMullen: Mike? J. Schlotman: It's really tough. If you look at the cadence of comps during the first quarter, the first 4 weeks of the quarter were a little bit stronger than the rest of the quarter but not remarkably high. In the second, third and fourth periods, the second and third were affected by the Easter shift. If you kind of normalize Easter between the 2 periods, they were very, very close to one another. So I don't think there was a huge bump in the first quarter as a result of weather. It certainly helped, but it's not what made the 4.6% strong. The second, third and fourth on a combined basis certainly contributed to the results as well. Kenneth Goldman : Okay. And then as we look at your comps into 2Q, any particular headwinds or tailwinds we should be thinking about? Just a little more color on how things are progressing so far this quarter. Just curious on those lines. W. McMullen: Yes, we wouldn't see anything unusual versus what it's been running, and we would continue to be slightly above our guidance range in terms of, so far, this quarter and very similar to the first quarter. Kenneth Goldman : One last quick one. It's a bit tricky because of the different days in the quarter and Harris Teeter. I just want to make sure. Your D&A was up 12% year-on-year. Your interest expense was up 14% year-on-year. Are these roughly the growth rates we should be modeling for the rest of the year on a year-on-year basis? W. McMullen: For the year on a year-on-year basis, yes. They will be in that kind of a range because of the Harris Teeter depreciation, as well as the debt we took on for Harris Teeter. And then obviously, next year, we'll return to a more normal level. The other one that's a little different than what we've historically reported is rent as a rate of sales because the large majority of the Harris Teeter stores are leased, not owned like ours, so that affects that line as well, and we break that line out separately. Operator : And the next question will come from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : I just wanted to delve a little bit more into the upside in the quarter. So you beat the high end of your guidance, I think, by about a few pennies. Was that all driven by sales upside, or are there other things in play? J. Schlotman: The sales piece would be, by far, the biggest driver of the upside. Michael Ellis : And just to clarify, we don't give quarterly guidance, so we only give an annual guidance. So the only thing you can compare it to is what the Street expectations were. Rupesh Parikh : Okay. And then you also mentioned that you're seeing better signs of a consumer this quarter. What are you seeing in some of your more discretionary areas of the business? W. McMullen: Well, we've really seen -- I mean, if you look, it's continuing a good, solid trend. It's always hard to define what's discretionary. But certainly, if you look at what areas people cut back on first, we continue to see strong growth on that across the board. I don't know, Mike, anything you want to add to that? J. Schlotman: No, that pretty much sums it up. There's been some mix changes in what people are buying, it looks like. But overall, it's been strong all across the board. Operator : And our next question is from Ed Kelly of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Lauren Wood : This is actually Lauren Wood on for Ed. Just a quick question. Can you remind us what percent of your stores have a heavier mix of natural and organic selection and where that number could potentially go to? And then also if you see a comp lift when you add -- when you sort of bulk up that offering in your store? W. McMullen: Well, I don't know if there's any particular area that has a higher mix of natural foods. We tend to -- it's a strategy for the company to improve our natural foods offering across the country, so any of our new stores or remodels, we try to be aggressive on natural foods positioning and the amount of products we carry. So it's pretty much throughout the country, and it's definitely a strategy of ours, and it's really connecting well with customers right now. Michael Ellis : And it's not always -- pretty much every store has some offering of natural and organic products. What we're finding is it's as much a lifestyle decision as it is a demographic-driven topic. And people of all demographics are choosing a healthier lifestyle, so we actually have the product. And really, I can't think of stores I go into that don't have some. Now the size of the store can dictate how much you have, but it's a broad-appeal product. Lauren Wood : Okay. And then just a quick one. Can you update us on your total MEPP liability? Michael Ellis : I don't remember what it is off the top of my head. It was in our 10-K and the MD&A. I don't want to guess the number because I'll be guessing wrong. You can follow up with Cindy and I after the call, but it was in the MD&A and our 10-K. Operator : And the next question comes from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : I had a housekeeping item first before I got to my bigger question. The ROIC calculation you guys ran in the report, it seems like, and maybe I'm wrong, but basically, Harris Teeter's reflected in the denominator, but the numerator is not pro forma, or is it? J. Schlotman: Okay. So you are correct, Scott. And you also noticed that we went to 1 decimal place instead of 2 decimal places. So the way that works, it's rolling 4 quarters calculations, so your denominator becomes the average assets at the beginning and the end of the year. So you effectively have half of Harris Teeter's assets in there because of that averaging but only 1 quarter of their EBITDA. We'll get more and more of their assets and more and more of their EBITDA as we go throughout the year. So we did it a couple ways. If you look at it just the way this calculation is, it was about 2 basis points down. If you pro forma Harris Teeter in there for the whole time frame, it was about 2 basis points up. So we just decided that rather than try to confuse it, we're going to call it the 13.5% until the end of the year, and then we'll go back to 2 decimal places, I would think. Scott Mushkin : Okay, perfect. So then the second question is actually more of a strategy question. I mean, you look at the broader food landscape here, and I think you guys just out-comped Whole Foods, if I'm not wrong about that. But on the other side of the equation, you're clearly out-comping Walmart. You have a format now and probably the best high/low operator out there. You got big data. When do we -- and you just bought Harris Teeter, so -- but when do you put this more aggressively on the road? I think you're in 34 states now. When does Kroger really start to drive even more growth? I mean, clearly, you're taking enormous market share where you are, either through more M&A or more aggressively venturing into places you're not. W. McMullen: Scott, as you know, if you look at our fill-in markets, that is the first part of that, and it's really -- if we look at the returns from that, the higher our market share, the higher our ROIC. So that's really the first phase of that is we're increasingly getting aggressive on fill-in markets. And that's -- we're very pleased with the early result. In terms of new markets, by merging with Harris Teeter, we really view that is going into several new markets. And as I've mentioned in the call, one of the things that we're really excited about is the market share opportunity, growth opportunity that Harris Teeter has, and we will aggressively partner and support growing in several of those markets as well. So from our perspective, that is going on the road with it in the context of where we think we see the highest return with the capital that we've allocated. Scott Mushkin : Any chance we get a bump in the growth rate that you have out there? 8% to 11%, I think you've been exceeding now for a while. W. McMullen: We're not even 2 years in the 8% to 11%, Scott. Let us get comfortable and used to this one for a little bit. But as you know, the key to our growth rate is being sales-led in growing our business and then continuing to executing against our model. So I agree with Mike. Give us a little time, but that's really how we're trying to drive to grow our business. Michael Ellis : It's one thing to announce investments in October of '12. It's another thing to begin making those, and then it's another thing again for them to come out of the ground and start generating sales and EBITDA. So there's a lag from when you make the announcement until you get there. Keep in mind, our share buyback in the first quarter is very strong. That was contemplated in our guidance. And we told everybody in October '12 for the first couple, 3 years, 1/3 or half of our growth was going to come from share buyback until our investments started to mature. So we'll have to wait until that tipping point happens, Scott, and see where we are at that point in time. Operator : And next, we have a question from Karen Short of Deutsche Bank. Karen Short : Just on the comps, looking at the numbers that Harris Teeter reported last year, it looks like I mean they actually had some pretty decent comps throughout last year, right up until their third quarter. So I'm kind of wondering if you could give some color on what the impact for Harris Teeter was on your comps. J. Schlotman: Yes, we won't give specifics, and obviously, when we talked in the fourth quarter, we said we would -- we gave guidance with Harris Teeter in it. We were pleased with where Harris Teeter's numbers was. It was consistent with the budget, and that's true for EBITDA as well. But I won't give specifics in terms of how effective the overall total Kroger number other than it wasn't much. Karen Short : Okay, that's helpful. And then I know you obviously gave color on your inflation in the current quarter. What are your expectations on inflation for the whole year or full year? J. Schlotman: Yes, we're kind of expecting in the range where we saw in the first quarter to hold true for the year. I figured inflation was going to come back up again, so I actually flipped to a page in our \u2013 you've see me carrying the bluebook around the conferences, Karen. If you look at some interesting things, and without fuel and pharmacy, last year's inflation cadence was 1.7%, 1.6%, 1.5% and 0.8%. And everybody's concerned about inflation right now. In our first quarter, that same metric was 1.8%. Grocery inflation in this year's first quarter was actually lower than grocery inflation in last year's first quarter, and pharmacy and meat and produce are basically in the same range. So this isn't a world we've lived in, and it's not a huge shift, really, from where we were about the same time last year. We're comfortable managing the business in an inflationary environment like we have today and think we're going to see this continue. There's some grain prices out there that are favorable. Milk looks like it's peaked, and it's going to start to come down a little bit, which will help the grocery inflation index because that's where we classify milk when we talk about inflation. So we think it's going to be pretty comparable to where it is today. Karen Short : The bluebook came in handy. And then just the last question. It looks -- obviously, you gave your dollar amount for the buyback, but it looks like you're done, pretty much done with your authorization. So any comments on that? J. Schlotman: We did have -- our expectation in our guidance for the year, contemplated a front-end buyback program. It is somewhat unusual for us to go without any kind of an authorization. What I would say is unless there's -- I wouldn't expect significant incremental buyback activity for the rest of the year. W. McMullen: And it's really left up to our board on the approval. J. Schlotman: Right. Operator : And the next question is from Meredith Adler of Barclays. Meredith Adler : I'm going to probably talk about something a little bit bigger picture. I was very intrigued by the commentary about pension and specifically that you had some employees, a small number, but some employees shift to a 401(k) plan with matching and also that you moved a much larger group of employees to a different plan. Could you just talk a little bit about kind of what the discussions were, why would somebody move away from a defined benefit plan, and what do you think the prospects are for other people recognizing the value of a 401(k)? W. McMullen: Yes, there were clearly a couple different moves here, Meredith, both of which came together in the same quarter. The folks in the Pacific Northwest, there were actually 2 separate moves with those folks. They're continuing -- their accrued liability moved into the consolidated UFCW plan that we established a couple years ago. So we took their historical liability that they've already earned into that company-managed UFCW plan. Their future benefits are being accrued in the sound plan, and it's not a sound plan from a financial standpoint, although it's very well-funded. It's called a sound fund in the Pacific Northwest. So that was a group of retail associates. The second move was a group of King Soopers pharmacists who happen to be unionized. Same thing, we moved their obligation, and it was actually through the negotiating process with them where they had the desire to go into our 401(k) plan and be able to manage their investments themselves and accrue those dollars and move them around as they see fit, and that one was really associate-driven at the negotiating table. I will tell you we have some high-level talent dedicated to this effort. In fact, if you remember, a year or so ago, we moved Scott Henderson, who was our Treasurer, and he spent a good chunk of his time, one, he manages our entire pension investment program, both of the -- all 3 of the K plan, the company plan and the UFCW plan, as well as spends a lot of time with our labor negotiators trying to do this. Our view is we're trying to be proactive on this front, not reactive. And we think by being proactive, it's the best thing for our associates, not only for the pension they've already earned but for the pension that they would expect to earn going forward. J. Schlotman: And Scott and Mike working with our labor negotiators and the union, they understand the opportunity and need for this, and this really does improve the quality of the benefits our associates have and secures -- and improves the security of their ultimate benefit. So it's one of the things where the union is also working with us on these, but it's a lot of work and a lot of effort. W. McMullen: It happens slowly. 300 contracts out there. Meredith Adler : I guess it's fair to say that repeating what you did with the pharmacists may be unusual because they are a unique group of employees. W. McMullen: Perhaps. You never know what's going to happen in the negotiation. All I know is the unions and Kroger both have a desire to continue conversations to try to come up with creative solutions to secure -- to help secure the benefits they've already earned and give them a decent benefit accrual going forward as well. Meredith Adler : That's great. And then I'm going to just switch gears talking about fuel. You had what looks like a pretty attractive margin on fuel this quarter. And I assume that's because prices were coming flat or coming down. Is that fair to say? And kind of what's your outlook, if you can have an outlook, about fuel prices for the rest of the year? And also, did it contribute to earnings per share in any kind of a meaningful way? J. Schlotman: What we always say about fuel is one thing we'll guarantee, and that is it will be volatile. It was volatile inside the quarter. There were days and weeks where we were not as thrilled with our fuel results, and then there were days and weeks where we're very thrilled with our fuel results. Relative to the retail price per fuel, in quarter 1, on a total company basis, fuel supermarkets and convenience stores combined, the average retail price per gallon last year was $3.524, and this year, it was $3.456, so it was actually a little bit lower on a combined basis between the 2 years. And the cost was actually about the same amount, maybe just a touch amount lower as well. So it's -- and we had very, very strong gallon growth, almost 6% gallon growth. W. McMullen: It helped the quarter, but it wasn't the driver for the quarter by no means. And as you know, we always budget fuel margins kind of the same this year as the prior year. And over time, that always seems to come out pretty close to right. Along the way, there's, as Mike mentioned, quite a bit of volatility. Meredith Adler : Right, and I'm just going to throw in one more quick question. I think I just didn't hear what was said about pharmacy and what pharmacy did maybe to comps and anything else about pharmacy profitability. I don't know if you made a comment. Some stuff broke up when I was listening to it. J. Schlotman: Yes, I made a comment when I spoke about ID sales for the quarter, that they continued their strong performance both from a script count and the sales count -- sales basis. So good ID sales growth in dollars and scripts. Operator : And next, we have a question from Andrew Wolf of BB&T Capital Markets. Andrew Wolf : Wanted to ask one follow-up on the inflation questions that you've been getting. With meat rising really quite rapidly the last couple months and the quarter coming out okay in gross margin and you guys saying your survey works, looks like your customers are loosening up their pocketbooks. Are you seeing a lot less change in behavior in terms of trading down in proteins and into lower-quality meats and stuff like that? Well, that's really the question. So it's kind of a pass-through, and are you able to pass it through in a sort of more reasonable way than you would 1 or 2 years earlier, when that type of thing happened? And how's the consumer reacting to that? Michael Ellis : If you look at meat, specifically, you can clearly see behavior changes as prices increase. So people buying more cube steaks or buying more hamburger, those kind of things, you can clearly see. The comment on the customer overall is very broadly in terms of if you look at what they're doing in total. We feel very good about and we like what we're seeing in terms of customer in total being willing to spend a little bit more. Andrew Wolf : Okay. And I wanted to ask just a follow-up on Harris Teeter. I know you guys do a lot of survey work with customers, and Harris Teeter has a pretty rich loyalty card as well. Have you been able to do any survey work with their customers? And could you reveal what it is you might have heard from them in terms of -- maybe in terms of the 4 keys that you guys go to the market with or that kind of thing? I know at a conference, recently, you said perishable pricing was a focus, for example. Michael Ellis : If you look at, obviously, Harris Teeter has done customer research for years. And before, in a couple of markets, we would have our customer research on Harris Teeter just because they were somebody else in the market. Harris Teeter scores incredibly strong on people and products and freshness of products. So when you look at produce, meat, deli department, they score very well. And their associates are very friendly, and that's really their strong suit. And we would expect, when we start doing the combined research that, that's consistent with the research Harris Teeter had done before. We would expect to see the same. Andrew Wolf : And where they score well, let's say, in some of that merchandising and maybe customer interaction as well, is that something where that can be integrated into all or parts of Kroger? Or is it just too much of a task given the size differential between the 2 companies? W. McMullen: Mike Ellis, on his prepared comments, talked about it a little bit. I can tell you that Mike Ellis and the operators are spending quite a bit of time trying to understand exactly how Harris Teeter does that. Mike, you're in the middle of all of that. Michael Ellis : Well, it's really been fun to have someone who was a competitor that you admire, and now you can actually see what they do, how they do it. But as Rodney mentioned, they've been really strong on some of the matrix, better than us in several markets. So to learn how they do what they do has been actually, really, a lot of fun, and we're integrating some of that into some of our operations today throughout Kroger. Operator : And our next question is from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Stephen Grambling : I guess turning back to the guidance, given the big buyback upfront, it looks like the year assumes a bit of a change in the margin on a stand-alone basis when factoring in the high LIFO charge. I know you don't like to get into this that much, but can you talk qualitatively about your underlying gross margin, even OG&A assumptions in the back half and any unusual shifts we should be expecting? J. Schlotman: Yes, I wouldn't -- I won't get that granular. The closest I'll come is we did make comments about operating profit, and as we get a full year of Harris Teeter into the numbers, we would expect our operating profit margin to not be the 12 basis point rolling 4 quarters increase we had in the first quarter. But as we get a full year of them in, we would expect it to come closer to the slight increase that we project overall. Stephen Grambling : Okay, that's helpful. And then I think the other thing that, I guess, Kroger's been doing that's a little bit different than other areas in retail is moving towards a few of the larger-format stores, marketplace stores. As you look at general merchandise, which has been shifting online, and you learn from click and collect at Harris Teeter, how are you thinking about the opportunity to offer general merchandise at a broader group of stores with the web? And what are the implications for sales per square foot? W. McMullen: Well, all of our large stores have some selection of general merchandise, including apparel, in all of our future plans and remodels that we're working on. And we're really pleased with the results, pleased with sales per square foot and pleased with customers' reaction to the product offering. So it is part of our strategy going forward. Stephen Grambling : And for the smaller stores, is there an ability right now to actually have click and collect on general merchandise? W. McMullen: Not today. We would expect to take the Harris Teeter click and collect, as Mike mentioned, to other -- to do it in another market. We like what we're seeing there. Operator : And our next question is from Jason DeRise of UBS. Jason DeRise : It's Jason DeRise. Wanted to ask on natural foods, obviously growing double digits. Can you share what it contributed to the 4.6% comp? W. McMullen: We really wouldn't get into that level of detail in terms of how much of the 4.6% is driven by that. Mike did mention that all departments were positive identicals. J. Schlotman: All departments and all geographies. W. McMullen: Yes. So it's broad-based, so that isn't the thing that's driving it, but obviously a nice growth. Jason DeRise : And when you look at your customer data, do you think that this is a customer who's just entering the category in a more meaningful way now that you're offering it? Or do you think that, perhaps, this is sales that previously were outside of Kroger, at maybe a specialty store, and now that shopper is deciding to do that trip back at Kroger solely? W. McMullen: I think it's all of the above. There's been lower prices in a lot of areas in natural foods, so it's bringing new customers to the category. But certainly, people are more health-conscious for their family and the things that they consume. So a lot of our customer insights are driving a lot of the decisions on what we carry and what we put into our stores. And they are \u2013 customer is shouting that this is something they're really interested in, so it's a big focus for us. Jason DeRise : I think it was maybe a year or 2 ago, there was a lot of talk about how Kroger only has half of their customers' grocery spend. How has that trended since the efforts in natural foods and other categories to try to win more of that share? W. McMullen: Jason, it's a great question, and it's one that if you were in the room, you'd see us smiling at each other because it's pretty similar to what it was because the fortunate part, we keep adding new customers. So if you look at the loyal shoppers that have been loyal for a while, we continue -- that 50% would probably be more like 70% to 75%. Fortunately, we keep growing our customers, so you have new loyal customers coming in. So when you look at the blend of existing loyals and new loyals, it's still around the 50%. Michael Ellis : Yes, and if you look at ID loyal customers, it would be much higher than 50%. But the good news is, is we keep adding people that become loyal below the 50%, so it dilutes the total back down. W. McMullen: Obviously, natural foods helps on that, but it's really across the whole store that we're picking up that customer, including the fresh departments, produce, meat, deli, bakery, seafood. Jason DeRise : Okay, great. And I guess I just wanted to see if I can put this in there on Harris Teeter. Would you quantify just the EPS accretion for the quarter just so that we can sanity-check the original guidance on that? W. McMullen: You should assume that our original guidance, our updated guidance would have the same base assumptions for the Harris Teeter contributions to the year. I did mention that Harris Teeter is performing consistent -- a little bit better but not a lot in terms of the analysis that we used when we were working on the merger. So we're pleased with where they're tracking, and it would be consistent with what we shared before. Michael Ellis : Right on track with what our expectations were. Jason DeRise : I mean, there's been, in the press, I guess, part of it's your press, but that the Harris Teeter started dropping prices, similar type of press releases that you had seen coming out of other Kroger banners on this. And so that's -- I guess is there anything you could share about how that's gone. Is that what's driven maybe a bit more of the upside response to that, or is that not where the incremental upside has been? W. McMullen: Yes, it's really very, very early in that process. And what we're doing is the synergies, as we accomplish them, Harris Teeter is taking that money and giving it back to the customers. So it's really giving the customers something back from the merger and some of the savings, and Mike mentioned insurance, for example. Operator : And next, we have a question from Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research. Charles Cerankosky : Looking again at the pension benefit announcement you made the other day, Mike, I'd like to get a better idea on how the cash flows are going to look on this. You're obviously not going to pay $56 million immediately. But at the same time, how might that be broken up over the next 5 years or so as it moves into the funds, and is there a corresponding offset in your hourly contribution to these plans? J. Schlotman: A couple questions there. So the $56 million is the after-tax cash we'll have to put in. And as we said, we have up to 5 years to do that. We really haven't decided exactly how we're going to do it. The Kings Sooper pharmacists is a smaller part of that total contribution, and we actually have longer than 5 years to do theirs. But you should expect some plan over the 5 years to do it. What this really does is, technically, what happened is assets and liabilities came attached to their already earned and accrued benefits, and that's what we're shoring up in these plans. Going forward, they will continue to earn benefits. In the pharmacists' case, they'll get a K plan matched. In the Pacific Northwest contract, they'll continue to earn a benefit going forward, and there will be cents per hour accrual for those benefits going forward. So it won't reduce that. Charles Cerankosky : So the $56 million is to shore up the plans, and whatever's negotiated going forward is an additional pennies per hour kind of deal? J. Schlotman: Right. Now, what we don't have to negotiate and worry about funding going forward is any cents per hour to make up the $56 million because we'll do that separately. So going forward, any portion of an hourly contribution that was there to make up an underfunding in the plan, obviously, we've already negotiated that and walled it off. So all we have to worry about funding is future benefit accruals, not vested benefit accruals. It'll be separate. Charles Cerankosky : And announcements of this sort are likely to recur, but it's very difficult to forecast when and how frequent. Is that a fair statement? J. Schlotman: Can't predict when and how, and it's one of the reasons we had a disclosure of this kind of activity in our outlook section in the 10-K because -- that's why we dedicated some very talented resources to this because we would love to continue to pick off opportunities like this to secure -- to help secure the pension benefits of our associates going forward in some of these underfunded plans, get that out of that fund. If that fund runs into trouble, we know our associates are taken care of because we have them in a fund that we're helping manage. And we do view that what we have is an obligation to do that for them. Operator : And the next question is from Philippe Guzens [ph] of Mitsubishi. Unknown Analyst : [indiscernible] has recently indicated that they had seen a pickup in competitive activity, not only, obviously, in their home market with the expansion of Albert Heijn [ph] stores, but also in some U.S. markets. Should we read into that that you, perhaps, have sharpened a little bit your pricing already with Harris Teeter, given that they do compete with the Food Lion stores in a number of markets? W. McMullen: Yes. As I mentioned before, that's a good assumption, but it's just early in that process. Unknown Analyst : Okay. And then just as a follow-up, if I may. I may have missed this, but following the announcement yesterday, have you indicated by how much your multiemployer liability will shrink on the balance sheet? J. Schlotman: Well, that amount we put in the MD&A is not entirely on our balance sheet. And theoretically, it will be reduced by the $56 million once we fund it. That $56 million will actually now sit as a liability in our balance sheet until we do fund it. Operator : And next, we have a question from Kelly Bania of BMO Capital Markets. Kelly Bania : Just on your comp guidance, you clearly raised it. First quarter was strong, sounds like second quarter's running strong as well. And you talked about a little bit of a less cautious consumer behavior, which I don't think I've heard you guys say for a while, and upticking inflation. So just curious if there's any conservatism in that 3% to 4% kind of outlook for the rest of the year or any other thing that we should be thinking about getting back to a 3% to 4% range. W. McMullen: The one thing that -- if you look at last year by quarter, the fourth quarter actually was a little better than the trend had been. It wasn't driven by weather, but it was helped by weather. And as we start cycling some of those things, until you actually cycle them, obviously, you don't know where you are. Now we'll always hope that we're a little conservative, but until you get there, it is our best estimate at this point it time. I don't know, Mike or Mike, you want to... Michael Ellis : I agree completely. J. Schlotman: I would agree completely also. Kelly Bania : Great. And if I can just add another question on natural foods, clearly up strong again. Just curious, if you look at your competition, whether it's discount channel or supermarkets or elsewhere, do you see them investing as much as you are in natural product categories? I mean, I realize Walmart's announced a Wild Oats line. We haven't really seen that show up in stores yet, but do you think some others could start to invest more in natural foods as well? Or what are you seeing versus your competition? W. McMullen: Well, there is investment. We're seeing competitive investment in natural foods. For us, we've positioned natural foods in different parts of the store now. You'll find soy milks, almond milks in the regular dairy case and things like that. So we're just trying to answer what the customer wants and have products available at a price they're willing to pay and in a location that they're happy to find them. So but competitively, yes, we've seen a little bit of move but not much. Operator : And that question will come from Kate Wendt of Wells Fargo Securities. Kate Wendt : So I just actually had a bigger picture question. As you look at your overall store base, whether you think you'll see a net increase in competitive openings against you this year or if it's consistent, you think, with last year or maybe offset by closures at weaker chains? Obviously, it doesn't seem to be affecting your comps this quarter, but just curious how you see that playing out this year. Michael Ellis : Yes, it's a good question. And you continue to see a lot of people talk about adding square footage in the space. Some of that square footage is dedicated to what we sell inside of a different format, be it inside of a Dollar General store or a drugstore or something like that. Walmart's obviously building some smaller neighborhood and kind of markets, so that's there. What kind of gets lost is competitors who are closing stores that I would call -- versus a small offering inside of another format, what I would call a destination store. So when you have a destination store close and it's 50,000 or 60,000 square feet and somebody else has added 1,200 square feet, that's really a convenience shop. It's a different kind of competitor. So I think we'll continue to see a lot of square footage open up that sells food. I think overall, the destination kind of square footage is probably flat to slightly down. Kate Wendt : Got it. That's really helpful. And then just one other quick one. I saw that you recently introduced a premium pet food assortment, which sounds like it could be a nice incremental comp driver for you guys. I was wondering how many stores that's in today and maybe how many you're planning by year end. And then it also sounds like maybe along with that, there's been a change in the receptivity of premium pet food brands distributing to the supermarket channel. W. McMullen: Yes, we just recently introduced, I'm glad you caught that, a new line of premium pet foods. And it should be in every store in Kroger, I would hope. That is the plan. And sales have started out strong, we're pleased with it. Glad you caught that.  Before we end today's call, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. Earlier this month, we introduced the Taste of Mexico event in all our stores. We hope our associates are enjoying this fun celebration of Mexican food with our customers, including in-store sampling, creative displays and special activities. I know I've enjoyed visiting our stores across the country and seeing the creativity, passion and enthusiasm from our associates for the Taste of Mexico. This special event is the first of a series of celebrations of foods of the world in our stores and runs through June 24. Our associates' passion for doing good is evident in the way we serve our customers and neighbors in the communities where we live and work every day. This month, we honor our associates' efforts in serving our communities and those in need. We are pleased to recognize in our 2013 annual report 28 associates across the company for their outstanding volunteer service as recipients of The Kroger's 2013 Community Service Award. These women and men give their time and talent on our veterans, feed the homeless, raise money to fight cancer and bringing music to mentally challenged, among many other causes. We are grateful for their commitment. A big heartfelt thank you to all our associates who volunteer. Mike and I are proud of the work you do. You make a big difference for so many others and the communities we call home. Thank you.  That completes our call today. Thanks for joining us. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings and Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our second quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com.  After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] We are hopeful that you can join us for our 2014 Investor Conference in Cincinnati, beginning on the evening of October 28 and ending early afternoon on October 29. Details will be coming soon and we are looking forward to seeing many of you then. I will now turn the call over to Rodney McMullen, Chief Executive Officer of Kroger. W. McMullen: Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's second quarter 2014 results are Mike Ellis, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  Kroger achieved a strong and balanced second quarter. As we improved our connection with customers, we are also executing our growth plan and delivering on our key performance indicators, all of which is fueling strong financial results for our shareholders. Our second quarter performance highlights Kroger's continued growth momentum. We continue to deliver on the performance targets we outlined at our October 2012 Investor Conference, including: positive identical store sales growth; slightly expanding rolling 4 quarters FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel; and improving return on invested capital.  For the period, we achieved our 43rd consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales growth. We exceeded our goal to slightly expand FIFO operating margin, without fuel, on a rolling 4-quarter basis; and we increased our return on invested capital, while also increasing capital investment. Based on our strong quarter results, we are raising our net earnings per diluted share guidance and our identical supermarket sales growth guidance for the year. We expect to deliver a net earnings per diluted share growth of 13% to 15% for fiscal 2014. As you know, this is partially due to the benefit of Harris Teeter. We expect to return to our long-term growth rate of 8% to 11%, plus the dividend, in fiscal 2012 -- 2015, sorry. Thanks, Cindy. And we are not done growing and differentiating to better serve our customers. We are proud to welcome the incredible Vitacost.com team to The Kroger family. We are excited about the opportunity the merger creates to transform the customer experience and move Kroger directly into the e-commerce space much faster than we could have done on our own. The merger closed last month and our teams are hard at work developing our combined business plan. Mike Ellis will have more to say about Vitacost in a few minutes. Our merger with Harris Teeter is going very well and we are learning a lot from each other and we can't say enough great things about our Harris Teeter associates. We continue to see positive indicators in customer shopping behavior, both what our customers tell us and what their actual shopping behavior says. Kroger's data suggests some greater confidence in the economy and less caution in spending, consistent with what we saw in the first quarter. Even so, confidence in the economy and the economic recovery is not pervasive across the board. Many of our customers are still struggling and we continue to pursue our strategy of connecting meaningfully with all customers, wherever they are in the economic spectrum. It is worth noting that our definition of a loyal customer is based on a combination of how often a customer shops with us and the amount of products they purchase from Kroger. We have loyal customers in every segment of the customer spectrum, from value customers to upscale shoppers and everywhere in between. We continue to see our loyal households grow at a faster rate than total households. As you know, we developed the 4 Keys of our Customer 1st Strategy more than 10 years ago because we recognized that customers wanted a grocery retailer that would deliver not just 1 or 2 key advantages, but a total combination, including a great overall shopping experience, excellent customer service, a full assortment of both national and corporate brand products and everyday low prices and promotional offerings. Today, our customer research tells us that this is even more important. Our customers don't want to compromise by choosing retailers who do only well in only 1 or 2 areas. In short, customers are looking for a food retailer that can offer it all and that is Kroger's sweet spot. That is exactly where we've positioned ourselves to win, it is where we are winning and it is where we intend to continue to win. Now I'll turn it over to Mike Ellis to outline our operational performance. Mike? Michael Ellis : Thanks, Rodney. Good morning, everyone. First, I'd like to thank our associates for their solid performance. Strong and consistent execution is what allows us to continue making investments in all the 4 keys of our Customer 1st Strategy, including investments in our associates and ongoing price investment.  As Rodney said, loyal households grew at a faster rate than total households, which also grew for the quarter. This is important because it tells us that we are connecting with our customers across the entire spectrum and that we are connecting in the right areas : people, products and shopping experience and price. As expected, inflation continued to increase during the quarter, especially in meat, dairy and in pharmacy, which continued to produce solid growth in both script count and ID sales. We estimate inflation, excluding fuel and pharmacy, was 2.4% in the second quarter and 2.8% with pharmacy. Even with higher inflation, we saw strong tonnage growth during the second quarter.  Our corporate brands portfolio continues to resonate with our customers. During the second quarter, our corporate brands represented approximately 26.3% of total units sold and 25.2% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy. We saw strong double-digit unit and sales growth in Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organics. Our new entry-level price point brands and premium tier Private Selection brand all had strong positive sales and unit gains in the second quarter as well.  Another driver of sustainable growth is Customer 1st innovation. For the past few quarters, we have highlighted innovations that are improving our connection with customers and growing our market share. This quarter, I would like to focus on our merger with Vitacost.com. First, I'd like to echo Rodney's welcome to the Vitacost team. You're now part of team Kroger and we couldn't be more excited about that. This is a compelling transaction because of the incredible potential for transformation and growth. We believe Kroger is uniquely positioned to blend the art of retailing and deep customer insights with a superb online experience. Vitacost people and extensive e-commerce platform, coupled with Kroger's customer insights and loyal customer base, will really be a powerful combination that we can leverage to create new levels of personalization and convenience for our customers. We intend to build on Vitacost's robust technology platform and integrate it with our existing digital footprint to do just that. This is one of the reasons we recently asked Kevin Dougherty, who has been serving as Kroger's Group Vice President and Chief Supply Chain Officer, to lead this effort in a new role as Group Vice President of Digital and Vitacost. Kevin has been a leader on the Vitacost merger team from the beginning and, for the past several years, he has been increasingly focused on building our digital organization here at Kroger. We look forward to combining our teams to do great things for our customers together.  Now I'd like to provide a brief update on labor relations. We recently completed several successful contract negotiations, covering Food 4 Less associates in Southern California and Kroger associates in Cincinnati and Dayton. We are currently negotiating contracts with the UFCW for store associates in New Mexico, Toledo and agreements with the teams just covering several distribution and manufacturing facilities. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, should have a shared objective, growing Kroger's business and profitably, which will help us create more jobs and more career opportunities and will enhance job security for our associates.  Now Mike Schlotman will offer more detail on Kroger's financial results and update our guidance for 2014. Mike? J. Schlotman: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. When we outlined our accelerated growth strategy at our October 2012 Investor Conference, we also identified the key performance targets for shareholders to measure our progress. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the results in each metric. Our first metric is identical supermarket sales without fuel. We're very pleased with our second quarter ID sales growth of 4.8%. This strong performance was supported by ID sales growth in every department in every supermarket division. Our natural foods department continues to grow in the double digits, accelerated by significant household gains. Rolling 4 quarters FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel and adjustment items, expanded by 7 basis points. Over time, we expect our FIFO operating margin growth rate, excluding fuel, to return to slightly expanding on a rolling 4 quarters basis. The third target metric is return on invested capital. We reported a return on invested capital on a rolling 4 quarters basis, excluding adjustment items of 13.6%, which was an increase from 13.5% in the same period last year. Increased capital investments will make it more difficult to grow ROIC in the near term, however, we expect these investments to be accretive to ROIC as they mature. We expect our year-end ROIC, which will factor in a full year of increased capital investments and fully reflect Harris Teeter in our calculation, to show a slight decline compared to the end of fiscal 2013.  Now I'll share our second quarter 2014 results in more detail. Please note that this quarter includes Harris Teeter and Kroger's statement of operations, so year-over-year percentage comparisons are affected as a result. In the second quarter, our net earnings totaled $347 million or $0.70 per diluted share. Net earnings in the same period last year were $317 million or $0.60 per diluted share. As Mike said, we are seeing higher inflation than originally anticipated. We recorded a $26 million LIFO charge during the quarter, compared to a $13 million LIFO charge in the same quarter last year. We began fiscal 2014 estimating LIFO for the year at $55 million. At the end of the first quarter, we increased our LIFO guidance to a charge of $90 million. As reported this morning, we are increasing our LIFO estimate for the year to $100 million, which is an incremental $0.01 charge to net earnings per diluted share in the second quarter and $0.05 to $0.06 for the full year.  As we have mentioned in the past, we manage the company without regard to our LIFO charge and many of the items we discussed are on a FIFO basis. So when we develop our expectations for every given year, we estimate LIFO last. The reason for this is LIFO is merely an accounting convention. Typically, a higher LIFO charge would be a headwind to results, but our strong sales helped us overcome the higher-than-expected charge and increase our guidance. FIFO gross margin decreased 12 basis points from the same period last year, excluding retail fuel operations. Operating, general and administrative costs, plus rent and depreciation, excluding retail fuel operations, were essentially flat as a percent of sales compared to the prior year. Increases in workers' compensation and general liability reserves negatively affected this comparison by 8 basis points. Now for retail fuel operations. About half of our supermarkets have fuel centers today. In the second quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.18 compared to $0.165 in the same quarter last year. Our long-term financial strategy continues to be : maintain our current investment grade debt rating, repurchase shares, have an increasing dividend and fund increasing capital investments. Achieving the 2x to 2.2x net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio by mid to late 2015 remains a key objective. Kroger took on debt to finance the Harris Teeter merger and has not yet final -- realized a full year of Harris Teeter EBITDA. This has caused a significant increase in the company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio, which is 2.33x as of the close of the second quarter compared to 1.77x during the same period last year. This is, however, an improvement from the 2.42x we reported last quarter.  Kroger's net total debt is $11.2 billion, an increase of $3.5 billion from a year ago. This includes the debt related to the Harris Teeter transaction and the share repurchases activity so far this year. Kroger's strong financial position allow the company to return more than $1.9 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last 4 quarters. During the second quarter, Kroger repurchased 1.6 million common shares for a total investment of $78 million. All $500 million of the buyback authorization in June, granted in June, is still available.  Capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, totaled $672 million for the second quarter compared to $507 million for the same period last year. We continue to expect capital investments to be in the $2.8 billion to $3 billion range, including Harris Teeter for fiscal 2014. Now I'd like to update our growth objectives for 2014. Based on our strong second quarter results, we raised and narrowed our adjusted net earnings per diluted share guidance to a range of $3.22 to $3.28 for fiscal 2014. The previous guidance was $3.19 to $3.27 per diluted share. The company's long-term net earnings per diluted share growth guidance remains 8% to 11% and shareholder return will be further enhanced by dividend expected to increase over time.  We raised our identical supermarket sales growth guidance, excluding fuel, to 3.5% to 4.25% for fiscal 2014. The previous guidance was 3% to 4%. We are optimistic, as we look forward to the remainder of the year but, keep in mind, we had a very strong fourth quarter last year to compare to.  Now I'll turn it back to Rodney. W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike. As I've said this before, this is an exciting time to be at Kroger. We are accelerating growth in our core business and investing in unique competitive positioning for today and the future. Integration with Harris Teeter is going exactly the way we would hope and we continue to learn from each other in ways to improve our customers' experiences. We see transformational potential in Vitacost's e-commerce platform. We are currently hiring to fill an estimated 20,000 positions in our supermarket stores. Next week, we will open our 2,000th fuel center location and we are well on our way to exceeding our long-term earnings per share growth rate for fiscal 2014.  Now we look forward to answering your questions. Laura, we'll take our questions now. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Steven Forbes of Guggenheim Securities. Steven Forbes : So 2 questions. Number one, how much of the inflation that you saw in the quarter do you think actually passed through? Maybe, on a percent basis, did you pass 50% of it through or 75%? What's the general thought there? And then given your -- around your comments about the economy, I would think you probably could get a lot more of that pass-through here in the third quarter or is that not right? W. McMullen: Yes, on your second question, I wouldn't necessarily agree or disagree with that. And as you know, inflation is -- you really do have to look at it item by item. And as Mike mentioned, even with the inflation, we still had strong tonnage growth and we're very happy with the results in total. A lot of the inflation right now is in some of the perishable areas, the fresh departments and that, as you know, is very seasonal. And if you look at, like, some of the produce inflation, as soon as the next crop comes on, that can heavily impact it. On percentage, I would hesitate to give it because in some areas, we feel comfortable we probably passed 100%, others, not so. And as you know, overall, as I mentioned, tonnage is strong. We continue to reduce our pricing for our customers as we take cost out of the business to do that. Steven Forbes : Okay. And then, secondly, so if you think about Harris Teeter, how much scope is there for that organization to accelerate unit growth? I know there's a lot of potential for new stores, but -- and I don't know if that's spread out over more years, can they accelerate unit growth? And if they can't, if there's the capacity to do that, given the lead time on real estate, when would that be? Is that a '16 or '17 time frame or sooner? J. Schlotman: John, I think you'll see Harris Teeter have a little bit higher store growth over the next several years than they otherwise would have. They had a lot of projects in the pipeline as the 2 companies came together with the merger and the nice thing about joining Kroger for them is it gives them a little bit more capital capacity to be a little faster on getting some of those store projects up and running. It is true, in many of the markets they operate, where we have growth opportunities, the D.C. area, the Baltimore area, markets like that, the lead time is a little bit longer, but they've always had a very strong and forward-thinking capital plan. It's really just the ability now for them to accelerate some of those a little faster than they may have on their own. So we would expect that their unit growth will kick up from where it has been historically. W. McMullen: [indiscernible] average, the lead time is probably, what, 1 to 2 years longer than what we've been traditionally used to, unless you go to the West Coast. J. Schlotman: Right. Operator : And our next question will come Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : So I wanted to dive a little deeper into your expenses for the quarter. So compared to the past few quarters, we saw less expense leverage and I know you guys called out the more difficult comparison. Was there anything else that was unusual this quarter? And were the expenses in line with your internal plans? J. Schlotman: Yes, they were generally in line with our internal plans. The item that we called out in both -- well, that I just spoke of in the conference call, some increases in workers' comp and general liability reserves, a little bit of increase for this year, as well as some prior year increases in the allowances for that caused about an 8-basis-point negative effect on the OG&A lines. So we would've had a little bit better improvement or we would've shown some improvement if not for the need to increase those allowances. And I can tell you, that is certainly a point of focus for our operators and our loss prevention folks. The key to that isn't the dollars, it's making sure the accidents never happen. Rupesh Parikh : Okay. And then shifting to e-commerce, we've seen a lot more noise lately, whether it's from Amazon or Whole Foods and some of your competitors and you guys have clearly made investments with Vitacost. I mean, how do you feel about your current capabilities versus the competition right now? W. McMullen: It's a good question. I would say we feel very good, but we're not satisfied. And the changes that we've made over the last couple of years, we feel increasingly happy about what we're seeing. As you know, it's one of the things when we merged with Harris Teeter that we were really excited about. They have an incredibly strong click and collect operation that we're spending a lot of time on. And as you know, when we announced merging with Vitacost, they have a great group of people from a talent perspective and a great infrastructure that we think we can grow off and expand. So I feel very comfortable where we are positioned from a food standpoint relative to our competition. I feel even more excited about some of the things that we've put in place to take advantage of the future. Mike or Mike, do you want to add to that? Michael Ellis : Nothing, other than the fact that the merger just closed a month ago and we are working hard to bring both companies together and see all the benefits we can come up with here. Operator : And our next question comes from Karen Short of Deutsche Bank. Karen Short : I just wanted to dive a little bit into gross margins. So obviously, there's been a lot of news and press about Harris Teeter taking prices down and it's hard to know how much that would've impacted your gross margins on your P&L. But by my math, your core FIFO margins, excluding Harris Teeter, could actually have been up this quarter. Is that a fair statement? And then, I guess, maybe talk about how generics might have impacted your gross margin and other points that might be relevant. J. Schlotman: Relative to Harris Teeter, I won't go to that level of transparency. Harris Teeter is not the only place that we continue to invest in price. They've -- it's been fairly public about the price reductions they've done and where they've done them, but we continue to refine our pricing strategy in all the geographies we operate. And our goal always remains to grow our operating profit margin on a rolling 4-quarter basis slightly. We were 7 basis points and I've never given a specific number, although Rodney and Cindy both pitted me a little bit yesterday that I've always said, \"By that, it's a handful or less,\" and most people can count how many digits are on both of my hands. And it would be only 1 hand, not 2. So that's why we said we actually exceeded that goal a little bit this time and that's what we always focus on. And when we get the operating leverage, we can accelerate things that we plan to do later. And if things aren't quite trending the way we want to grow operating profit margin, we can slow a few things down. We've become very nimble on that arena, which has been a huge help. Karen Short : Okay. So then, just on your quarter, in general, did you guys -- you guys came in above plan in the second quarter, is that fair to say? And then, I guess, it was ahead of plan on earnings. Was that more gas margin related? And I guess, I'm wondering because you didn't beat the Street by much, but your gross margins came in quite a bit higher and yet, you're raising your full year guidance on the low end by $0.03, so... J. Schlotman: I think it's a combination of things, Karen. The strong sales, certainly, are encouraging for us and that momentum is always good. If you look at everything that has happened and the fact that we've increased our LIFO charge by what will amount to $0.05 or $0.06 more charge than we expected at the beginning of the year, we've now raised our earnings guidance twice, we've now raised our ID sales guidance. It's the combination of those factors that has allowed us to remain quite positive. While we only beat the Street by $0.01, LIFO cost us $0.01 and the 8 basis points from workers' comp and general liability would've been somewhere between $0.015 and $0.02, probably, at least, $0.02, depending on how things round. So despite those headwinds, the underlying strength of our core businesses, we're very happy with it. Karen Short : And the top line strength has continued into the third quarter? W. McMullen: Yes. So far, through the third quarter, it's very similar to where we were in the first and second quarters and I'm pleased with the continued progress. Operator : And next, we have a question from Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research. Charles Cerankosky : If we look at the P&L just for the third quarter, are there any Vitacost acquisition expenses worth calling out, Mike? J. Schlotman: We haven't really called out any merger-related expenses for Harris Teeter for a while. We had some, actually leading up to the merger, there's been a few small ones out there, nothing amounting to much of anything, although a lot of the heavy lifting on -- as we convert systems and maybe happened to write some of the assets off of their books that they have capitalized as we convert to our systems. Those things might face us in the future. But those aren't cash expenditures, they're things that were spent in the past. And Vitacost is just so new. Sure, there was a handful of expenses leading up to the merger. While we used outside counsel, we didn't use an outside financial advisor, so it's not like we had any kind of a fee to pay a third party in that. So there really wasn't much at all. Charles Cerankosky : And then, in your guidance for the remainder of the year, Mike, how much dilution from Vitacost is built into that number? J. Schlotman: It's negligible for the back half of the year and it's certainly contemplated in our guidance. They were actually operating here, very recently, at very close to a breakeven kind of a level. And we have a little bit of dilution built in, but nothing dramatic that we don't think we can overcome with the strength of the underlying operations. Charles Cerankosky : So something like less than $0.05 per share? J. Schlotman: Yes, sir. W. McMullen: Less than a handful of pennies. Operator : And the next question will come from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe research. Scott Mushkin : Most of my questions have been asked, but I just wanted to delve into the balance sheet. Mike, I know you talked about 2.33x and your 1.7x -- and I probably got the numbers all messed up, but you want to get them -- you want to get down to 2x. But clearly, there's been a lot of activity in the space. I just wonder, from your perspective, does your balance sheet right now preclude you from doing other things? Or would it -- it's a factor? Or how are you thinking about your balance sheet, given the fact that there's been so much activity in the space vis-\u00e0-vis M&A? J. Schlotman: We were 1.77x last year and we were at 2.33x this year, which was 9 basis points down from the first quarter. We feel very comfortable we're on track to get to the 2x to 2.2x. We'll be happy at the high-end of the range. We don't necessarily have to get to the 2.0x, Scott. That's just the range we winded up giving. I don't know that our balance sheet necessarily precludes us from doing anything. If the right opportunity is out there and we go to the rating agencies and they understand the uniqueness of an opportunity, like they clearly did with Harris Teeter, and our follow-through, when we make a commitment to them that we actually follow through on what we do, whether it's how we expect to grow the dividend, how we expect to use cash flow to buy in shares, how we expect to use capital to grow our business organically, we're very open with the rating agencies and follow through on the commitments we make. And if it's the right set of assets with the right growth opportunity, like Harris Teeter was with all the new markets, I don't think we would be precluded from continuing to participate in industry consolidation. W. McMullen: The other thing is the 1.77x was unusually low because we had stopped buying back stocks and some other things because we had already announced the Harris Teeter merger and we wanted to position ourself well to being able to merge with Harris Teeter. J. Schlotman: That's an excellent point. We were actually out of the market on shares for quite a while, as we were blacked out while we were looking at it as well. So it was a combination of factors. Scott Mushkin : That's perfect. And if I could have one more. I think you guys recently opened up 121,000 square-foot in Athens, Georgia and I think the comments and what I've read is that there's a bigger one to come down there. You guys are really the only ones opening up bigger stores, even Walmart is shrinking what they're trying to do. Can you kind of give us a reason why you're so comfortable with opening up these large stores and what you see what maybe other people don't see? Michael Ellis : Well, we've had good success with our marketplace format. It is driving a lot of our sales and growth right now. So really pleased with how they're performing, although we are still working on small-format stores. We're doing some work and research around that. So we're really trying to stay open to what's the customers looking for in terms of shopping experience. And so far, they've been really pleased with the selection that we have in the big store and we're really pleased with the results. W. McMullen: When we look at our Customer 1st tracker, customers can -- rate us very high in our marketplace stores. So it's really the things -- the combination of our associates and their connection with our customers and what we've put inside those boxes really connect well with the customer. And I realize 120,000 square feet, it depends on where you start from, it's a good-sized store but it's not so big that you can't manage getting around the store reasonably easy either. And it just gives you a lot of flexibility from a space utilization standpoint. And obviously, the key is making sure what you put in is exciting and something the customer wants. Operator : And the next question is from Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley. Vincent Sinisi : Wanted to ask a little bit more about Harris Teeter, if you guys can give further color in terms of the order online pick up at store capability that, obviously, was one of the big draws from Harris Teeter. Where are you in that process today? And any color that you can give in terms of, maybe, as you roll that capability out further? W. McMullen: It's still pretty early in the process. I can tell you that our teams have spent a ton of energy, but it's not something that we are to a point of announcing publicly. But I can tell you, we're progressing along and we're very pleased with where we are and we're very pleased with the progress that Harris Teeter continues to make as well. I don't know, Mike, if you'd like to... Vincent Sinisi : On the -- in the Harris Teeter brand itself, has there been further rollout? W. McMullen: Yes. Harris Teeter has continued to roll it out and they continue to have strong growth where they already have it. So it's really both pieces. Vincent Sinisi : Okay, great. And just a quick follow-up, switching over to Vitacost. I know, obviously, also very early in the stages, but any color that you can give in terms of, when it was announced, you said that of the 45,000 SKUs that Vitacost carries, you had about 10,000 overlap. Any work that's been done so far that you can just kind of incrementally share in terms of maybe what some of those other products, when we may start to see them flowing onto the shelves throughout your banners, your other banners? Michael Ellis : Well, again, we just really closed the transaction and we're right in the middle of putting plans together and going through all of the steps that you would during a merger of this sort and size and really trying to develop our plans for the future and how do we grow the platform, the Vitacost business. And we're learning a lot from Vitacost on what to do within the Kroger footprint also. So we're still in that discovery phase, but there is a lot going on and we're learning every day that there's more to learn. Operator : And our next question comes from Robert Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Robert Ohmes : For Rodney or Mike and Mike, the guidance obviously implies a little bit of a slowdown in the ID sales x fuel in the back half. Can you guys just maybe talk about what -- why IDs would slow? Would it -- and maybe what some of the support was? Is your expectation of support from fuel rewards potentially slowing? Is there an expectation of less benefit from inflation? Or is there an expectation that tonnage could slow? Just sort of any color we should think about as far as your opportunity to continue to beat those ID guidance you're giving us. W. McMullen: Thanks, Robert. First of all, obviously, we're going to strive to make sure the identicals are as strong as we can. If you remember, in the fourth quarter of last year, we had a lot of weather benefits. We didn't really talk about it that much in the earnings call, but there were quite a bit of weather benefits. Until you actually have it, you don't know whether it's going to be a headwind or a tailwind, so we're really -- the biggest reason for the conservatism in the identical guidance would be really cycling fourth quarter last year and not knowing how weather would be. It's really nothing -- you shouldn't read anything in it other than that. So we really don't see inflation changing that much. We really don't see the economy changing that much. We're not seeing the customer behavior changing either. Robert Ohmes : And then in terms of the sort of contribution from fuel rewards, has that been healthy? And is that expected to continue to incrementally support IDs as well? W. McMullen: Yes, it's a great question and it's a little harder to answer because it's hard to isolate just one piece and what it does for identicals. It's really the whole shopping experience. So we continue to make progress on the freshness of our product. Our associates continue to make progress on connecting with our customers from a friendliness standpoint. So it's really hard to say this piece of improvement causes this much to the identicals. Overall, as you know, it's just one more reason for somebody to shop at Kroger and it's part of the overall package of what we're trying to deliver for our customer. Operator : And next, we have a question from Kelly Bania of BMO. Kelly Bania : I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about category performance. I think you mentioned a little bit on private label, but I think if I'm correct -- or correct me if I'm wrong, that you had been trending with all departments, kind of, in the positive territory? So just curious if you had any update on that. Michael Ellis : It was a well-rounded quarter. Corporate brands had a very nice quarter. If there was any hiccup at all and it's not even a hiccup but, obviously, the high dairy prices has an influence on how many units of milk wind up getting sold. So that was a bit of headwind on corporate brands because so much of the milk that we sell is processed in our own dairies. But tonnage, overall, was very, very strong. All departments had positive ID sales. All geographies had positive ID sales. And once again, natural foods would have been the leader in the departments, with continued double-digit ID sales growth in that department. W. McMullen: Pharmacy was strong... Michael Ellis : Pharmacy was strong. W. McMullen: A lot of departments were strong. Michael Ellis : Good broad-based performance. W. McMullen: Meat, produce, et cetera. Kelly Bania : Great. That's very helpful. And then just curious if you could elaborate a little bit on the science of the less cautious behavior that you're seeing and it sounds like most parts of your store. Is that more any trading-up activity? Is it more items you're seeing in the basket? Is it less focus on couponing and promotions? Or just any color you can provide would be helpful. Michael Ellis : Okay. Well, it's as much an art as it is a science, but it's really looking at things that would be discretionary, what kind of performance are we having there. So if you think about Starbucks or Boar's Head, some of our cheeses, some of our upscale items, customers continue to engage in that in a much more positive way than before. And that's performance that's year-on-year. Also, if you look at some of the nonfood, general, jewelry, all those types of discretionary items, customers continue to be willing to spend money. And then we also survey our customers on their perception and customers are continuing to tell us they feel the economy is a little bit better, but they continue to be nervous in terms of their outlook on things. So it's cautious optimism, I think, is probably the best way to put it. Operator : The next questioner is Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Kenneth Goldman : I have 2 questions, if I can. You slipped in a mention of D.C., Baltimore today. Can you update us on what your plan is for your expansion into new markets, where you're most focused? You're looking to hire 20,000 new permanent employees. Is that a sign you are getting closer to that? Or is that not the right way to look at the press release? J. Schlotman: Yes, I wouldn't say the 20,000 new hires really has anything to do with any announcement of going into new geography. Those are, by and large, almost entirely, if not incompletely, jobs that are open today in geographies where we already operate or have plans over the next year to open stores in existing geographies. So those are actual current needs we have to have to fully staff our stores at the level we want staffed and be able to have schedules written away. We need them written in our associates who want to work inside of our stores. We continue to think about our new market activity. A lot of activity going on around that, but we aren't going to be premature in announcing where that may be. W. McMullen: Obviously, merging with Harris Teeter put us in a lot of new markets. J. Schlotman: A lot of new markets. And relevant to the earlier question that I think John asked, we would expect, they're relatively new to D.C., Baltimore, so for Harris Teeter, those were new markets and there's significant opportunity to increase our footprint in those markets. Kenneth Goldman : Okay. And then the drought in California, it continues to become, I guess, more worrisome. So as you think about some of the fruits and nuts and so forth that you source from there, I mean, you look into next year, some of these items might be in shorter supply. Are you planning more differently than what you might usually do? Do you have options from other geographies if, I guess, certain items from the U.S. are harder to find? Or is it just too early to even think about that? W. McMullen: I think it's probably too early to think about that, although, we have the same sort of issue, whether it's orange juice from Florida or other commodities from around the world, that we'll have short supply from time to time and we just have to deal with that as best we can. And we buy from around the world in so many cases today, whether it's in the fresh departments or other parts of our business. So we just have to deal with that as it comes, I think. Operator : And next, we have a question from Kate Wendt of Wells Fargo Securities. Kate Wendt : So your natural and organic sales growth has remained, obviously, pretty consistent here and strong. I'm curious how you're thinking today about this notion that the industry may be reaching a point where there's too much supply at retail for demand? Or do you think, instead, that the piece of the pie in terms of people interested in natural and organic is only continuing to broaden and deepen? Michael Ellis : Well, it appears to us that the natural organic customer is changing and growing in numbers and those that shop the grocery store are also crossing over. And the blurring of grocery and natural foods is becoming more and more difficult when you look around the store and you can see organic items on the regular grocery shelf. So it seems that the customer base is getting much larger for these types of products. I don't know where the end is. I mean, it might be a lifestyle change for our customers that they're just deciding to eat better and make different choices for their families. But we love the growth and we're going to continue to make sure that we have the products our customers are looking for. W. McMullen: We don't find that customer as an either/or shopper. There's a small percentage of customers that are only organic and natural, but most of our customer base actually buys across the whole store. Kate Wendt : I guess that was my follow-up. Do you have any data that you can share on what percent of your customers are buying some natural or organics products today? And maybe how many just started over the past couple of years or maybe even what type of households were you seeing the most growth in the category in terms of whether it's middle incomes or upper middle incomes? Or anything that you can share on that would be really helpful. W. McMullen: It would be well over half of our customers would buy something. That continues to increase. And the thing that I think is so hard is there's a lot of product innovation in that space as well, so some of the customers may be buying products there because of the innovation, not necessarily because of organic or natural. It's just because it's a new item and it tastes good. So how much of it is driven by one piece versus the other, I think it's pretty -- it'd be pure speculation. Kate Wendt : Interesting. And anything in terms of the sort of household income profile, are you seeing that kind of dip down into middle incomes or where you're seeing kind of the most growth? W. McMullen: It's really all customer types. It's not exclusive to one specific customer, by no means. Operator : And our next question is from Filippe Goossens of Mitsubishi. Filippe Goossens : I actually have 2 questions this morning, if I may. First one is for Michael Schlotman. Michael, if I look at your outstanding debt, there's still a few items with high coupons. Can you maybe, conceptually, talk about how you think about liability management? And then, my question for Rodney is kind of a follow-up on an earlier question with regard to smaller store formats. We're obviously monitoring, with great interest, the Family Dollar saga. We're also monitoring what's going on in the U.K. market, where companies like Wm Morrison are now using convenience stores as a way to compete with the Aldis and the leaders of the world. Can you maybe just kind of talk a little bit more about how you think about the convenience store format? Is that something that, down the road, may be part of your plans? Or are you still very happy with your current portfolio? W. McMullen: Yes, if you look at the smaller stores, obviously, we've been in the convenience store itself for years and years and years. I came to Kroger when we merged with Dillon. We would look at -- we are following Dollar General, Family Dollar every day as well. We consider both of them competitors. I can tell you all of us get into those stores on a regular basis, trying to learn what they do and how they connect with their customer and what are they doing good and what can we learn from them. And we think it will be important, over time, to have even a smaller store that's part of the profile, that's probably a convenient store and not necessarily a convenience store. But it's something we continue to work on. We haven't figured out how to make money the way we'd like to make money there, but we haven't given up either. Mike, do you want to talk about the debt? J. Schlotman: Yes, from a liability management standpoint, Filippe, we constantly look at some of those higher-coupon pieces of debt that are out there. Many of those are 30-year debt or what was 30-year debt at the time we issued it. When we look at the net present value of making a tender offer for those, it just doesn't often come out where it's an NPV positive on a cash flow basis. It may help accretion, it may be accretive to earnings per share on that basis, but the upfront amount you have to pay because of the premium that they'd be trading at, you wind up spending a lot of cash upfront. So we'll constantly look at it. I wouldn't say we have any plans in the near term to do anything about them and our approach has been, over time, to continue to manage our liability and have dollars coming due every year so we can be accessing the markets on a regular basis. We've actually taken a few hundred basis points out of our average interest portfolio. When we look at upcoming debt issuance activity, we do oftentimes enter into hedging agreements to lock in current interest rates in advance of actually issuing the debt. As we get closer to those, that is a type of transaction we often use. Operator : And our next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth of Jefferies. Mark Wiltamuth : Your comments that the recovery has not really been pervasive across the board, if you also look across the discounters that have not been showing strong grocery performance, it sounds like the weakness is really in that lowest income customer bracket. Is that true? And can you give us some insights on what's going on with that group? Are they just not responding to lower pricing at this point? W. McMullen: Well, I would say that we're very happy with how we're connecting with that customer. If you look at their economic situation, incomes have been very slow to recover and employment has been slow to recover. So it's really, when I make the comment, it's referring to the situation therein and we continue to try to make sure that we're able to address pricing and help their budget go further, both on the introduction of more entry price point items and, absolutely, just lowering pricing, too. So we're very happy with our performance for that customer segment, but that customer segment continues to be under a lot of economic strain. Mark Wiltamuth : Okay, great. And then, switching over to store growth. You've done a lot of consolidation of underperforming stores in recent years and that's put some pressure on your net store growth. But it sounds like you're coming to some end of that process. Is there a square footage growth rate you can commit to in future years that's a little more robust? J. Schlotman: Yes, I incorrectly predicted last year that our asset, Harris Teeter, that our unit growth would expand a little bit. So I'll probably be hesitant to repeat that great prognostication here. Obviously, we've been very aggressive on trimming some of the underperforming assets in our portfolio, which has slowed our store count. The question earlier on, in Athens, Georgia, opening it up at 121,000 square feet, there are times -- that was not the case, but there are times where we open a store like that and then may replace a couple of 40,000 or 50,000 square foot stores. So our square footage actually goes up, but our store count goes down by 1 as a result. I think, going forward, our guidance has been in the range of a couple of percent of square footage growth excluding the operational closings and I don't want to get married to a square footage growth on a net basis and not make the right decision on operationally closing a store, so we kind of look at our investments in new, relocated and expanded stores separately from what activities should happen on operational closings and look at those separately. So we continue to increase capital. We'll increase it a couple of hundred million dollars next year. We expect to open up more stores next year than this year and I think it will be a continued progression up in both our store count and our square footage. Mark Wiltamuth : So improving, but something under 2%, it sounds like. J. Schlotman: On a net basis, I would think so, yes. But Mark, keep in mind, that square footage is significantly more productive when you look at it on a sales per square footage basis. We're up roughly 50% on improvement in productivity in our stores since we started this Customer 1st journey 10 years ago. At the end of the day, I'd rather have more highly -- more productive square footage than more square footage that's a little less productive. Mark Wiltamuth : Okay. And then lastly, as you're looking at click and collect and some of the other models, maybe if you can comment a little on some of these personal shopping services that are out there from third parties. Have you looked into Instacart, into Google Express and some of these other ones that are out there? What are your thoughts there? W. McMullen: Yes, you should be very comfortable that we've looked at all of them and it's really trying to make sure we understand what our customers' wants and needs are. Some of the places where we believe that will be more successful are places where we don't have stores, but it is something we continue to look at and evaluate and look at partnering with, as appropriate. Operator : And our next question comes from Meredith Adler of Barclays. Meredith Adler : I wanted to go back to comments about ROIC and the fact that there are a lot of investments, not just including Harris Teeter, but other investments that are dampening it now, but we will see improvement. And I was just wondering if you can give us a better sense of, not specific numbers, but kind of in terms of magnitude, whether we're talking about remodels, new stores and then a sense of how we should expect the benefits of those investments to flow in? Is it going to be 2015? Or is there more in 2016? Just how is that all going to work out? J. Schlotman: Yes, Meredith. If absent the Harris -- Harris Teeter being in there for a full year this year and if you think about how an ROIC calculation works and we started to go down this path in the conference call and took the language out, so I guess I'll go down on that in the Q&A. Right now, we only have half of the Harris Teeter assets in the calculation because it's the beginning of the year and end of the year average assets that your return is calculated on. So right now, it's about half year's of EBITDA and half of their assets. If you think about an ROIC number for Harris Teeter based on the purchase price, it would've been an ROIC number below what Kroger had been generating. So a full year of Harris Teeter in here will reset the bar for ROIC slightly. It won't be dramatically lower, but we do expect it to be a little bit lower. Absent that, even with the increased CapEx we've been investing in the business, we would've expected ROIC to grow slightly, albeit somewhat slowly as we ramped this up. You typically see a couple to 3-year lag and a better growth of ROIC as you begin to increase your capital expenditures. So we're about midway into that 2- to 3-year time frame. So sometime in '15, '16, we should start to see a bigger benefit from those investments we've made 18 months ago and are starting to mature now and they'll overwhelm the new investments we make in '15 and '16 from a return standpoint. W. McMullen: Typically, on expansions in these stores, Mike, the first year actually hurts ROIC. J. Schlotman: Absolutely. W. McMullen: The second year, it gets almost neutral, but it hurts a little. Third year, it starts helping. J. Schlotman: Right. W. McMullen: If you look at the level of maturity. Meredith Adler : Okay. And when you look at the performance of the projects that you've done, are they all following the pro formas that you had built? Are you -- do you feel like they're -- or are they beating them? J. Schlotman: Well, it's like anything, all would be an overstatement of all hitting that or overperforming. It's a mixed bag. Some are a little below, some are exceeding it in a big way. But, by and large, most of them, many of them are right at the kind of expectations we laid out. The key there will be to continue to generate the sales and the EBITDA that those stores were expected to generate and then, in turn, hold our divisions accountable to give that EBITDA back to our shareholders and either back to us to continue to invest in the business or back to the shareholders so we can grow it. But clearly, as a group, these stores are performing very well and, I would say, are at a point right now of exceeding our expectations as a group. Meredith Adler : And then my final question would be, is it right to think about this level of investment as being something that will continue? I know you don't want to talk about moving into a new market. Or should we see this as sort of opportunistic and we'll see a moderation in, say, '17? J. Schlotman: I would not expect to see a moderation in the capital plans. We've got some great markets where we have average market shares or below average market shares when you look at some of our stronger markets. And the strong connection we see between market share and return on invested capital is one of the reasons we've gone down the fill-in strategy format. And I would expect to continue to see us have a very strong capital expenditure program. When we laid it out in 2012, we expected this to -- a couple of hundred million dollar increase for 5 years and it was going to start in '13. So that really gets you to the '17, '18 kind of time frame. And as we go through that process, we'll go through the report card like you just asked on the stores we've opened. And to the extent we continue to be happy with those investments as a group because, in the end, that's what affects our shareholders, is the group, we'll make ongoing decisions about how much we'll invest in capital. But based on where we are right now, I don't see any cause for pause. Operator : And that question will come from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Stephen Grambling : So as we -- I guess, just following up on Kate's questions earlier on natural and organics, you mentioned innovation as a big part of some of the growth you're seeing in the channel and the response from the consumer. Can you just provide a little bit more detail on the number of SKUs you've added in these categories, what additional rollouts are still planned and maybe, how much of the sales you think has been incremental? And then, kind of as a corollary there, how do you think about margin associated with this category versus other areas of the store? Michael Ellis : Well, in terms of incremental, it's hard to say. There's a lot of switching that goes on today between natural and basic type of products. As we've mentioned, we expect our Simple Truth brand to be a $1 billion brand this year. So customers are as interested today and as engaged in natural and organic as they've ever been. Also, we don't talk a lot about organic produce, but that's a category that continues to grow. Could probably grow faster if supply was better, but we continue to enjoy large sales growth in that particular area. Stephen Grambling : And so just, again, on the -- I guess, any additional SKUs that you're planning to roll out on top of what you've done already? And also how you think about the margin in these categories, I guess, now and going forward? Michael Ellis : SKU count continue to increase and the departments continue to grow in many cases, both on the private label side as well as the branded side. Margins, I'll tell you what, there's more margin pressure now on natural and organic than there's ever been. It seems that it's becoming more and more of a competitive category. And so although margins tend to be better in natural and organic, I don't know if that's going to continue for the foreseeable future. W. McMullen: Before we end today's call, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge that this morning is the anniversary of the attacks of September 11. We all continue to mourn the loss of the brave men and women who perished on that tragic day. And I know that many of the folks on the call today were personally affected by those events. We continue to honor the memory of the fallen through our support of police, firefighters, the military and their families. On behalf of all of us here at Kroger, we want to say our heartfelt thank you to the everyday heroes who work every day to keep us all safe.  Finally, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. September is Hunger Action Month and I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our associates across the company who help support our customers and neighbors in need. According to our partners at Feeding America, the nation's largest hunger agency, there are 46.5 million Americans who don't know where their next meal will come from. Together, we are working to combat poverty, in partnership with 106 local Feeding America food banks. Last year alone, Kroger contributed the equivalent of 200 million, that's right, 200 million meals, nearly 4 million meals every week, to feed hungry families in our community, which I just find an amazing number and my hats off to our team.  Of that, our Perishable Donations Partnership Program provided more than 50 million pounds of fresh meat, produce, dairy and bakery items directly to local food banks in 2013. Our associates play a vital role in helping us get this fresh, healthy food to those who need it most. Without your help and support, our Perishable Donations partnership would not be possible. Thank you.  That completes our call for today and thanks for joining us. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Cindy Holmes, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Cindy Holmes : Thank you, Emily. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially.  A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our third quarter press release, which includes a reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures discussed today, and our prepared remarks in this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thanks, again, to those who participated in our October investor conference in person or via webcast. We appreciate that many of you made the trip to Cincinnati, and as always, we enjoyed the dialogue and the opportunity to show you our stores. I will now turn the call over to Rodney McMullen, Kroger's Chief Executive Officer. W. McMullen: Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's third quarter 2014 results are Mike Ellis, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  Kroger continues to deliver consistently remarkable results. We are well on our way to achieving our 10th consecutive year of lowering costs and reinvesting those savings in our people, products, pricing and improved store experience, which together are driving our growth. Few can deliver this level of sustainable high performance. After a while, it can be easy to take this consistency and reliability for granted. So it's important to keep in mind that these results are possible only because 375,000 associates engage with our customers every single day. Our associates delivered yet another quality quarter of inspired Customer 1st performance. We continue to implement our growth strategy and consistently deliver on the key performance indicators we first outlined in October 2012. In the third quarter, we achieved our 44th consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel. We exceeded our goal to slightly expand FIFO operating margin without fuel on a rolling 4-quarter basis, and we continued to gain market share. Our third quarter financial results were driven by strong sales and core business performance, which was better than we expected. Higher fuel margins drove our results above our previous guidance range. Our guidance range for the full year assumes fuel margins will not be as strong in the fourth quarter as they were in the third quarter. Mike Schlotman will have more to say about our supermarket fuel operations in a few minutes. How our customers are doing today depends on the stability of their family finances. Overall, our customers continue to spend a little more as confidence in the economy improves over time. While inflation is apparent in certain commodities, fuel prices have been going down, which helps all customers, especially those on a budget. We try to help those customers stretch their food budget in a variety of ways. Our weekly promotions and fuel rewards help, along with price investments. We continue to make natural and organic foods affordable and accessible to all customers, especially with Simple Truth. Our expansive corporate brands offering is resonating with customers seeking high-quality food at very good prices. In fact, our Corporate Brands had their best performance in several years in the third quarter. Our ability to deliver this combination of value sets us apart. Now I will turn it over to Mike Ellis to discuss our operational performance in the third quarter. Mike? Michael Ellis : Thanks, Rodney. Good morning, everyone. During the third quarter, we continued to grow the number of loyal households, and our loyal household count grew at a much faster rate than total household growth, which, incidentally, was also up for the quarter. Loyal household growth is an important measure of our business because it lets us know how well we are connecting with our best customers. Inflation increased in the third quarter, as Rodney mentioned, among commodities such as meat and pharmacy and increased to a lesser extent in all other supermarket departments. As Mike Schlotman will discuss shortly, we raised our LIFO charge estimate for the year again this quarter due to the higher-than-expected inflation. We estimate inflation was 3.5%, excluding fuel, for the third quarter. Even so, we saw strong tonnage growth in the third quarter compared to last year. And in fact, it was slightly ahead of the second quarter's unit growth. Corporate Brands had an outstanding third quarter, representing 27.3% of total units sold and 25.8% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy. In fact, Corporate Brands experienced its highest sales growth and total retail dollar share of any quarter in the last 3 years. So clearly, our rebranding -- rebranded opening price point in Kroger banner brands are a hit with our customers. Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organics continued to earn double-digit unit and sales growth. A key driver of Kroger's sustainable growth is Customer 1st innovation. For the past few quarters, we have been highlighting innovations that are improving our connection with customers. This quarter, I will highlight some of the new and exciting work of our manufacturing team in the dairy department. We recently opened a state-of-the-art dairy processing plant in Denver. We built and engineered the plant to deliver exceptional quality and freshness for our customers and to provide an avenue for innovation in the dairy category. We incorporated new technologies for our customers that ensure our milk will stay fresher longer than ever before. We are the first dairy in the U.S. to deploy robotic technology that enables us to pack cases and pick and palletize orders entirely by automation. Another innovation that this dairy will bring is the ability for us to produce long shelf life products to meet growing demand for aseptic products and packaging. The dairy, our first ground-up manufacturing plant of any kind in 20 years, opened in May and began full production of fresh milk in August. We have been producing fresh milk, organic milk, juices and drinks, and customer response has been very, very positive. Now I'd like to give a brief update on labor relations. We recently completed several successful contract negotiations covering Smith's associates in New Mexico, Fry's and Smith's associates in Arizona, Food 4 Less associates in Southern California and Kroger associates in Toledo, West Virginia and the Ohio Valley. We are currently negotiating with the Teamsters covering several distribution and manufacturing facilities. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages; good quality, affordable health care; and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension cost, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, should have a shared objective : growing Kroger's business and profitably, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for all of our associates. Before I turn it over to Mike Schlotman, I'd like to thank our associates for the impressive quarter. Once again, you showed our customers how much we care about them, and each and every day, you continue to deliver. Because of your efforts, we are able to continue investing in our products, lowering prices and improving the shopping experience in ways that generate customer loyalty. Now Mike will offer more detail on our financial results and our guidance for the remainder of the year. Mike? J. Schlotman: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. As you know, when we outlined our growth strategy in 2012, we identified the key performance targets for our shareholders to measure our progress. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing the results in each metric. Our first metric is identical supermarket sales without fuel. Identical sales performance is the best measure of our growing connection with customers over time. We're very pleased with our third quarter ID sales growth of 5.6% without fuel. This strong performance was supported by ID sales growth in every supermarket department and division, and our natural foods department continues to lead with double-digit growth. Rolling 4 quarters FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel and adjustment items, expanded by 9 basis points. This exceeded our goal of slightly -- to slightly expand FIFO operating margin without fuel on a rolling 4 quarters basis. We are not reporting our third metric, return on invested capital, this quarter because the calculation would actually overstate our result. We expect our year-end return on invested capital, which will fully reflect Harris Teeter in our calculation, to be similar to our return on invested capital at the end of fiscal 2013. Now I'll share the rest of our third quarter 2014 results in more detail. Please note that this quarter includes Harris Teeter in Kroger's consolidated results of operations. Year-over-year percentage comparisons are affected as a result. In the third quarter, our net earnings totaled $362 million or $0.73 per diluted share. This includes a $0.04 benefit in the third quarter due to certain tax items. Excluding these items, Kroger's adjusted net earnings were $345 million or $0.69 per diluted share for the third quarter. We view these tax benefits as nonrecurring. So as you begin to think about 2015, please note that we will not be growing off of that next year. Net earnings in the same period last year were $299 million or $0.57 per diluted share. Last year's third quarter net earnings per diluted share benefited from certain adjustments totaling $0.04 per diluted share. Excluding these adjustments, last year's third quarter net earnings were $0.53 per diluted share. We recorded an $85 million LIFO charge during the quarter compared to a $13 million LIFO charge in the same quarter last year, resulting in an incremental $0.09 per diluted share charge to net earnings in the third quarter compared to the same quarter of last year. We began fiscal 2014 estimating a LIFO charge for the year at $55 million. At the end of the first quarter, we increased our LIFO guidance to a charge of $90 million, and at the end of the second quarter, we increased our LIFO charge estimate for the year to $100 million. As reported this morning, we have again increased our LIFO charge estimate for the year to $180 million. FIFO [ph] gross margin decreased 2 basis points from the same period last year, excluding retail fuel operations. Operating, general and administrative costs plus rent depreciation, excluding retail fuel operations and the adjustment items, decreased 21 basis points as a percent of sales compared with the prior year as a result of good expense control and strong sales leverage. Now for retail fuel operations. In the third quarter, our cents-per-gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.232 compared to $0.171 in the same quarter last year. This does not include debit and credit card fees. Last year's third quarter margin was well above historical averages, which means this quarter's margin performance was remarkable. Our long-term financial strategy continues to be to maintain our current investment grade debt rating, repurchase shares, have an increasing dividend and fund increasing capital expenditures. Achieving a 2 to 2.2 net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio by mid to late 2015 remains a key objective. Kroger took on debt to finance the Harris Teeter merger and has yet not realized the full year Harris Teeter EBITDA. As a result, the company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.29 as of the close of the third quarter compared to 1.86 during the same period last year, as described in Table 5 of our press release. This is an improvement of -- from the 2.33 reported last quarter. Kroger's net total debt is $11.5 billion, an increase of $3.4 billion from a year ago, including the debt related to Harris Teeter transaction and Kroger's share repurchase program. Kroger's strong financial position allowed the company to return more than $1.8 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last 4 quarters. During the third quarter, Kroger repurchased 600,000 common shares for a total investment of $29 million. All $500 million of the buyback authorization granted in June remains available. Capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, totaled $681 million for the third quarter compared to $641 million for the same period last year. We expect capital investments to be at the low end of the $2.8 billion to $3 billion range, including Harris Teeter, for fiscal 2014. Now I'd like to review our updated growth objectives for fiscal 2014. Based on our strong third quarter results, we raised and narrowed our adjusted net earnings per diluted share guidance to a range of $3.32 to $3.36 for fiscal 2014. The previous guidance was $3.22 to $3.28 per diluted share. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, Kroger expects identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of approximately 4% to 5%. We acknowledge this is a wide range for one quarter, and we are seeing great strength and momentum at the start of the fourth quarter, but this year's fourth quarter is difficult to project narrowly because of the uncertainties relative to a year ago, including the positive effect that weather had on our identical supermarket sales during last year's fourth quarter. As you start to think about fiscal 2015 estimates, we encourage you to build your models based on fiscal 2014 adjusted results, which exclude certain tax benefits and charges related to the restructuring of certain pension plan agreements. If fuel margins return to historical levels, we expect 2015 results to be closer to the low end of our long-term net earnings per diluted share growth rate guidance of 8% to 11%, and shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend expected to increase over time. Now I'll return it back to Rodney. W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike. Our third quarter performance is further evidence that Kroger is improving our connection with customers and delivering growth for our shareholders. We continue to increase capital investments, which creates exciting opportunities for our business and for our associates. We enjoyed discussing several of those opportunities with you during our investor conference in October. Our positive momentum is expected to carry through to the fourth quarter and sets us up well as we look to 2015. More importantly, Kroger's to-do list remains longer than our done list. There is a lot more to come. Now we will look forward to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Karen Short of Deutsche Bank. Karen Short : Just a couple of questions regarding your guidance and, I guess, also this quarter. So obviously, gas margins more than offset the higher LIFO charge this quarter, and this year has been an incredible year from an earnings growth perspective. But I guess, what my question is, looking to next year, Mike, you talked about the lower end of the range of earnings growth. And I understand you're coming off of a very strong year. So my question for this current year is, was the strength more in overachieving on the Harris Teeter accretion side? Or was it broad-based across the core and Harris Teeter? And I guess that would lead me to, if it was broad-based across -- or if it was more Harris Teeter related, that explains why you might be at the lower end of the 8% to 11% next year. But if it was broad-based across Harris Teeter and the core, are you just being conservative for next year, even though this year was incredibly strong? J. Schlotman: Wow. There was like 3 or 4 questions in there. Which way do I go with the answer? Well, fundamentally, this has been a very strong year across the board for us with the ID sales that we've had so far this year and ID -- positive ID sales in every department and positive ID sales in every geography. Our core business is performing extremely well. It's not just incremental accretion from Harris Teeter, it's strong results from all of our core operations. The primary reason for the conversation about being at the low end of 8% to 11% for next year is solely where fuel is at $0.23 for the quarter. And really, the last 2 quarters have been well above historical averages with the amount of fuel gallons we sell and that kind of outperformance on historical fuel margins. We just wanted people to be aware as they start thinking about 2015 of that potential headwind. If you were to kind of take the business apart and look at our core operations for 2015, they would perform extremely well inside the 8% to 11% range, and it's really just a headwind from a potential lower fuel margin per gallon for next year. Karen Short : And is it fair to say that Harris Teeter has come in slightly better than expected for the year so far? J. Schlotman: Yes, I would characterize Harris Teeter as performing how we expected them to perform. We've -- as has been widely publicized, they've not been shy about advertising it. We've made the price investments in their business that we expected to make during the year. The customers are responding to those price investments, and I would characterize Harris Teeter as right on track with what our expectations would be relative to our overall guidance for the year. W. McMullen: The Harris Teeter team has done a nice job of running their own business, but the other thing is they've been incredibly helpful helping teach all of Kroger some ideas as well. So it's been great so far, and the synergy's moving along as we expected as well. Karen Short : Okay. And then, just last question. On next year's earnings growth, what's embedded in terms of share buybacks? J. Schlotman: We'll give full guidance in March. We just know that at this time of the year, with 3 quarters behind us, clearer fourth quarter guidance, since we only have one quarter left, people start to refine their 2015 estimates. And we just wanted to give some insight of our view of a percentage growth rate and where we would expect to fall in that range as you all start to prepare your estimates for 2015 or refine those estimates. But we'll wait until we give full guidance in March. We feel we've gone far enough with the EPS because our board has its annual business plan review meeting in January, and it's probably better served to let them approve our business plan for next year before I give you too many lines. Operator : Our next question is from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. Steven Forbes : It's actually Steve Forbes on for John today. Regarding gas, so we've historically found it difficult to find any real correlation between gas prices and comps. What are you seeing during the most recent period since these declines? I know you've recently touched on it before. But is there any particular region to call out? You mentioned the low -- lower-income consumer. Or is there any demographic that you can expand on as well? W. McMullen: The -- if you look at our own numbers, we would have difficulty finding some of the same correlations. When gas prices go up, our fuel reward program has a little bit more strength. As gas prices go down, people have more money to spend. So as you know, when we look at fuel, we just look at one more service that we're offering the customer and one more reason to come to Kroger. The comments that we made -- that Mike and I both made, we continue to see improvement in the economy. It's slow, but it's going in the right direction, and it's really across all customers. But if you look at mainstream and up, those customers have fully recovered. The customers that are on a budget are improving, but it's much slower and more constrained. Steven Forbes : Okay. And then just on the deployment of these windfalls, is there -- I'm sure there's thoughts around how to invest these benefits. But do they occur too quickly in order to appropriately plan for the deployment? Or is it just better to let it flow through to the bottom line? How do you guys think about these onetime or short-term benefits? W. McMullen: Well, if you look at like the tax settlements and stuff, we just let those, for the most part, be when they are. And we just disclose it to let you know what it is. And it flows to the bottom line, but it's onetime. If it's things that we think are things that are sustainable, those are the things that we would look at in terms of continuing to invest in the business from a service standpoint and a price standpoint. But it's -- as you mentioned, it's always a balance between those 2 pieces, and we are always focused on what's going on in the marketplace and what do we think is the best use of that opportunity when it happens. So it doesn't answer your question directly because the answer's actually different depending on what we see the opportunities to be. Operator : Our next question is from Judah Frommer of Credit Suisse. Judah Frommer : Judah on for Ed. You mentioned in the release and also on the call the kind of rolling 4-quarter x fuel operating margin being a little bit stronger than you expected it to be. I mean, is that a way of saying you would have liked to maybe invest more in price? Or how should we kind of translate that? J. Schlotman: I don't think it's a reflection of having -- wanting to invest more in price. It's really a reflection of having Harris Teeter in for a portion of the year and not all year compared to results last year that didn't have Harris Teeter in the numbers. And I would say that's the same thing for the -- just a couple of basis points decline in the gross margin number I talked about. If you were to strip Harris Teeter out of the prior year, you would have seen a much bigger amount that we have invested in, in price to continue to give value to our customers, but it's really that -- the fact that their historical numbers have been higher than ours, and it's the mention of those together that's driving some unusual comparisons. We've continued right on track with what our expectations were for investment in all 4 keys of our Customer 1st Strategy, not just price, but the people, the products and the shopping experience as well, and continue to be very pleased with the reaction our customers have with those investments. Judah Frommer : Okay. And if I could just sneak one more in there, maybe shifting gears. On natural organic, it sounds like it's still comping really well. You've mentioned, in the past, maybe eventually seeing some margin compression in the category. And now that you have one of the bigger players in this space with a national ad campaign out there highlighting value, have you seen anything in kind of the near term on margins there? Michael Ellis : I haven't really seen margin pressure overall. We continue to invest in price where we feel appropriate, and the customer really drives our pricing strategy for the most part. But again, we had strong sales growth and double-digit growth in national organics. And to go back to our Simple Truth brand, which will hit $1 billion this year, we're really proud of where that's going and what it's contributing. Operator : Our next question is from Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley. Vincent Sinisi : I also wanted to ask a bit more on the natural organic. Obviously, Simple Truth continues to perform very well. But can you also give us a little color on how some of the other categories and products within natural organic are doing? And maybe touch upon, also, some of the Vitacost products? Michael Ellis : Well, in natural foods, the expansion of item selection is continuing to grow. And you're finding more and more products in the dairy category. We just introduced a new line, the Simple Truth lunchmeats. So there's a lot of activity. And we're still finding so many of our customers that didn't shop natural foods are beginning to migrate over to that business, which has been really, really good for us. On the Vitacost piece, we're still in a honeymoon. It's only been a couple of month since we merged with Vitacost, and there's a lot of work going on, but we have big plans for Vitacost, and we're excited about the merger. I've been to the facilities, down to their offices, to their warehouses, and it's a great business that we have. And we're excited about where we're going to go into next year. Vincent Sinisi : Okay. Great. And just a follow-up, if I may. Regarding your relationship, the dunnhumby relationship, as you continue to have nice growth in your loyal households and loyal customers, I know that part of what you're looking at is also not only continuing to have your current loyal customers purchase more, but also convert others into being loyal customers. Can you talk about any -- if there are any either new strategies or learnings that you're finding as you're going through? W. McMullen: If you look at all of our data insights, and dunnhumby that you referenced is obviously one piece of that, but there's a lot of other insights, you're continually getting insights and testing things. And the things that work, you do more of, and the ones that don't work, you stop doing. And that never stops. So it's an ongoing basis in terms of trying to understand customer needs. So if you think about your earlier question on natural and organics, well, that's some insights from our customers. But one of the things our customers are very clear is they don't want to have to pay a premium for natural and organics, and we're trying to make sure that we have where they can get a good-quality product at a price that's comparable to the nonorganic brands and, in some cases, actually the same price. So it's, really, that would just be one example, but there's a whole host of things where you're continually trying to get insights, insights on actually where to locate stores. It's broad parts of our business, and it's actually getting that insight and using it is the key. Operator : Our next question is from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : So I just wanted to just touch on inflation. Clearly, you had a nice benefit in inflation this quarter. I just want to see if you guys can share, maybe, your early thoughts for inflation for the upcoming year. J. Schlotman: As we sit here today, we would actually expect -- I'm always hesitant to go here because I've proven my inability to predict this with the fluctuations we have on our LIFO charge, which is tied to inflation, but we would expect inflation next year to be a little bit more moderate than it is this year. Clearly, the protein categories don't really show any signs of letting up on inflation. Chicken may happen if corn prices stay down at some point, but beef and pork, we would expect to see probably close to double-digit inflation again next year. Milk, at this point, again, as you know, the milk prices are driven by federal market order. As we sit here today, it looks like they may come in some, which would help a lot of categories next year. But overall, just given where some of the core input categories are, it looks like we should be a little bit lower than the 3.5% that's out there. That said, embedded in that 3.5% is pharmaceuticals, which continue to have -- particularly in the generic category, which has not always been the case, which continue to have quite high inflation in them. W. McMullen: One of the things that we think is important, when you look at inflation over the last 10 years, Kroger's been able to really manage in all inflationary environments, whether there's been deflation or inflation. There's always a transition if it suddenly changes quickly, very high or very low, to manage that transition. But over time, we've found that we really -- our associates have the ability to manage in all environments. Rupesh Parikh : Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just shifting gear to your ID sales. Do you feel -- as you look at your IDs this quarter, do you feel that you're maybe winning new customers maybe at an accelerated pace from earlier this year? W. McMullen: The thing that's exciting, and Mike mentioned it in his prepared comments, we're seeing good growth with our existing customers, but we're also seeing new loyal shoppers. And so it's really balanced across both, and that's one of the things exciting. And it's been -- it's a little bit higher now than earlier in the year, but it was strong earlier in the year, as well. I don't know, Mike, if you want to add anything. Michael Ellis : No. I think you hit it. It's just -- it's been solid, yes. Thanks, Rodney. Operator : Our next question is from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : Mine's actually much more of a kind of strategic, long-term question and just trying to understand kind of the growth trajectory of the company. You guys were nice enough to take us to a Marketplace store, I think, that was converted from a regular grocery store. And it seems like that conversion has gone quite well. So I guess I'm just trying to understand. It seems, as we think about Kroger, that in a lot of ways, you have a better mousetrap at this stage, and that Marketplace store is certainly one of the key elements. You guys went through -- and this goes way back in the, I think, late '60s, early '70s, into a big kind of store upgrade cycle, and you became a good to great stock in Jim Collins' work. I mean, how close are we to really getting into a big upgrade cycle on your store fleet where you really deploy Marketplace in a much more aggressive way? So that's my first question about long-term growth. W. McMullen: Well, as you know, when you were out in October, we're obviously very excited about the Marketplace stores and the use of all our formats together. It's one of the reasons why, a couple of years ago, we committed and -- to increase our capital investment by $200 million a year, and we continue to do that. We think that's a good amount to accelerate capital by in terms of the ability to operate the store at the level that you saw and balance in terms of the use of the cash flow. As long as -- as we continue to get the performance from those stores as we expect, you'll see it to continue accelerating that capital investment. But that was the reason why, in October of '12, we outlined the need to increase capital by $200 million a year. I don't know, Mike, if you want to... J. Schlotman: No, I would agree with that, and it's -- we -- as you know, Scott, we continue to expect increased capital over the next several years by incremental amounts. I -- if there's one disappointment I have so far this year, it's that -- actually, that we're at the low end of our CapEx guidance. I know some people out there think we spend too much on CapEx, but that just means some stores aren't coming out of the ground as quickly as we had hoped. It doesn't mean that we're less bullish on the new stores we're opening. It's just a matter of timing of those projects, and they will get caught up. So we're very bullish on our ability to continue to open new stores and have them perform very well. Michael Ellis : One other comment. We have Marketplace stores now in just about every division of our company across the country, and the success we're having with the Marketplace store has been really pleasing. But you asked about remerchandising, and I know you saw apparel in some of our stores now. We're having some success in -- with some of these new brands, some of the new products we're putting in. So we continue to work on the model to make it relevant to the customer, but we're really pleased with what we have today. Scott Mushkin : And as a follow-up -- I mean, any thought process as to how many stores in the store fleet could eventually be Marketplace? J. Schlotman: We probably do, but probably not for public consumption at this point, Scott. The other thing to keep in mind is, as we go down this path, and you'll probably see it a little clearer as we get into next year, we continue to invest in our business. And a fundamental piece of being able to invest in our business is continuing to generate a really good return on our new investments. And some of those dollars, we make conscious decisions of how many fall to the bottom line and how many we invest back into the business and the people, product, shopping experience and price. And while I know a lot of you would think that we should be at the end of investing in price, we still see plenty of categories and particular sections of the store where we have an opportunity to be more price competitive than we are today. So we're, in some respects, counting on that continued good results from that deployment of capital to both increase to have the 8% to 11% earnings per share growth and have the dollars generated to invest back in our business. Scott Mushkin : And then I just had one more, and then I'll yield. And it goes to the long-term growth again. M&A, we talked about it at the Analyst Day. It seems, again, Kroger, better mousetrap, fuel program, dunnhumby, customer insights, Marketplace store. It seems, as you guys evaluate -- at least from my perspective, evaluate M&A activity, there's almost a checklist of what you might want out of a company that you were going to acquire. But it does seem like it's a little bit different now, given the success you have with your business. Any thoughts, any additional thoughts? Again, I know asked this at the Analyst Day, but I wanted to revisit it. W. McMullen: Yes, I wouldn't say that there's anything much different than what we answered. As we talked about then, one of the keys on any merger, how's the -- how are the people that run the business? And do we think, culturally, they have the same values we have? And that's one of the reasons why we always talk about mergers rather than acquisition. You get a more limited number of opportunities when you have that standard, but what we find is, when people have that standard, they like it going the other direction, as well. And we always like to point out the fact that 2 of our last 3 CEOs came out of one of our merged companies and several of our senior officers. J. Schlotman: And our current President... W. McMullen: Yes, came out of one of the merged companies. So I think you're right when you say it's almost a checklist because it is, but it's something that's really worked well for us. J. Schlotman: And Scott, something I would add to that. And I certainly understand your question and the seeming benefits we could bring to some M&A activity that may be not as strong as we may hope or not have everything on our checklist. When you sit back and you have opportunity x and you look around the organization as a company in our geographies where we are today, and you can clearly see where you can double market share in specific geographies by deploying new capital in those geographies. And you have a base of people and a recognition in that market and already strong customer acceptance. We typically default to that fill-in strategy that we talked about because it's a much surer thing, takes a lot less time and energy of the organization, has significantly less management distraction. And we're perfectly willing to sit and almost wait, not necessarily troll around the country for those opportunities to come long like the Harris Teeter did. W. McMullen: The other thing that would be needed for us to change our approach is if we find that we're able to develop talent faster than we can use it within our existing growth where -- because if we bought something that was something that needed to be fixed up, we would obviously need to figure out a way to put talent into it in a way that was effective. And that would require a different level of talent than we're producing today because we're really focused on developing the talent to support the growth we have. Operator : Our next question is from Mark Wiltamuth of Jefferies. Mark Wiltamuth : Could you give us a little perspective on just how much the gas gain was in EPS terms? And what quarter should we really think about the headwinds starting to arrive as you lap the stronger margins from last year? J. Schlotman: Yes. We -- Mark, we won't go into the benefit of the EPS benefit. But if you think about a $0.23 fuel margin and $0.17 last year, you get a feel -- we talked about, in a lot of places, the number of gallons that we pump. So you should be able to back into a number that gets you relatively close. We just don't want to -- we think about that department as any other department inside the company, and it happens to be performing very well right now. I would say, clearly, the second and third quarter of next year, if margins revert to a more historical kind of level, would start to experience some headwind from lower fuel margins. Again, we didn't say \"when\" in the comments purposefully. We said \"if\" because nobody can really predict where it is. And we typically turn fuel a lot faster than our competitors. So in down cycles, that's good. In up cycles, that's bad. So if fuel were to turn the other way and -- or oil was to turn the other way and start going up, that actually creates an incremental headwind, not just a normal headwind, because we're turning the fuel so quickly. But clearly, second and third quarter. W. McMullen: And one of the things, as Mike mentioned earlier, we have a January meeting with our board for them to actually approve our '15 plan. Normally, we would not share '15 details until the fourth quarter earnings release, but we just thought it would be helpful to give a little bit of color on what we're thinking and what we're seeing before then for next year. Mark Wiltamuth : That's fair. And then, on the inflation in those meat categories where you're still seeing that double-digit inflation, are you passing all that through? Because we are hearing some other retailers are having some difficulty passing it through. J. Schlotman: Well, inflation for us -- inflation and deflation come and go all the time, and we're constantly dealing with pricing and how do we continue to give value to the customer through inflation and deflation, whether it's meat, produce or any other part of our business. So we try to manage it in a way that still gives great value to the customer, and the customer decides what they're going to pay. But I can tell you our tonnage is good, and inflation is extremely high right now. And we're just trying to really manage our way through it. Operator : Our next question is from Stephen Grambling of Goldman Sachs. Stephen Grambling : As you think about just the broader industry, I was hoping you could just talk maybe about where you think some of the gains that you're getting are coming from, how you see that evolving. I think it was at an Analyst Day a few years back where you discussed some of the regional players ceding share pretty consistently. Are you seeing that accelerate? Or is there anything else that you can just talk to broadly? W. McMullen: It's -- as you know, we don't ever talk about specific competitors. In terms of where the market share is coming from, it's always easier to ask the question than it is to see. It looks pretty broad-based in terms of where it's coming from, but we see, at some other national players, they are gaining share as well. So we're not the only one. But there's still about half of the market that's out there that's not people with our economies of scale, and it's not necessarily just small regional people. Some of them could be a little bit bigger. And then the other piece is we continue to add categories that we didn't even have before, which is helping some of our growth. Stephen Grambling : That's helpful. And then, are you seeing any difference in terms of the comp performance by the format of your stores? And do you feel like, after so many years of positive ID growth or productivity growth, that you're hitting a ceiling in any of these? W. McMullen: It's a good question. It's -- if you look at the comps, you always have pockets that are better than others, but it's very broad-based. And when you look at age and other things, obviously, newer stores will have a higher comp than older stores. But outside of that, there's nothing that would cause us to say one thing or the other. And probably -- I'm sure we have some stores that are getting close to capacity, but as a general rule, we have plenty of capacity within our existing stores to continue to increase the business. Operator : Our next question is from Kelly Bania of BMO Capital Markets. Kelly Bania : Just wanted to ask about the guidance for the fourth quarter for IDs. You mentioned the difficulty in forecasting when you cycle that benefit from the winter weather last year. I'm just curious if you are able to or have been able to at all look at your data and use dunnhumby and see how much of that boost that you may have had last year was from existing or loyal customers versus new customers and if there's any strategies in place to help kind of cycle that benefit that you may have had last winter. J. Schlotman: Well, clearly, we can understand where that business is coming from, and in those -- in regions where the snow or the weather is going to be -- get volatile in a big way, you get a lot of people from all spectrums of the loyalty umbrella, if you will, from people who rarely shop with you, but they come to you because you might be the one that is on stock on product, to your most loyal customers who come in and stock up. Obviously, we aren't -- for the fourth quarter, Mike Donnelly and Robert Clark and their merchandising group isn't sitting back just hoping for weather for us to be able to cycle the great sales we had last year's fourth quarter. They know what days and what weeks there was weather, and they would have strategies in place to try to cover some of the uplift we had in the -- from that snow. But the amount of incremental volume you get in a 36-hour period from snow is phenomenal, and it would be a Herculean effort on their part to be able to come up with strategies to overcome all of it. Clearly, we're going to go do our best to overcome it the best we can. We'll have weather. We don't know when. We don't know where. We don't know what day. We don't know... W. McMullen: Or how much. J. Schlotman: We don't know if it'll be by the end of January. We don't know if it'll be in February, March at the beginning of the next year. But it happens every year. You just don't know when. W. McMullen: Yes, the other thing is, when you look at the weather, I have a couple of friends that own quite a few fast food restaurants. And they will -- they always tell me that they hate snow because it actually has the opposite effect on them. So it's actually some of our increase is getting business that customers would sometimes be going to other channels. And obviously, when kids stay home, they're eating at home versus eating at school. So some of it is just switching where somebody eats. J. Schlotman: Right. Kelly Bania : Got it. That's helpful. And then just another question on gross margin. Your FIFO gross margin x fuel only down 2 basis points in spite of some of the high inflation you mentioned in some categories, just any comments on the ability to pass that through and how that maybe compares to historical standards? I mean, are you finding it easier or the same in terms of passing along inflation at these high levels in some of the protein categories? J. Schlotman: As always, it's almost a category-by-category decision on where the inflation is and what the price points are doing to the customers. And if you pass it all on, what do you think the effect on units is going to be? And if you don't quite pass it all on, are you better off at the end of the day not passing all of it on? So it's a category-by-category decision. And I know Mike Donnelly and his team spent a lot of time trying to decide exactly what price points and how much of inflation to pass on and when to pass it on. I do want to reiterate that a couple of basis point decline in gross margin would have been a more normal decline in gross margin -- when I say normal, kind of the historical kind of numbers you would have seen in 2013 versus '14 if not having Harris Teeter in this year and not in the base. We continued to invest in the price -- actually, all 4 keys of the strategy this quarter. It's just that, with Harris Teeter being in there at a higher gross than we typically have run, it makes that decline look smaller. W. McMullen: The other piece in terms looking at it on a -- from a historical standpoint, part of it is trying to decide how long is the inflation going to be in place. In some items, we would anticipate inflation is only going to be 4 to 8 to 12 weeks, depending on if it's weather-driven or if it's industry and other driven. That will also affect our ability and influence on how we try to pass that through as well. Operator : Our next question is from Chuck Cerankosky of North Coast Research. Charles Cerankosky : If -- you're mentioning sales were off to a strong start thus far in the quarter. Can you give us a little detail on that, including general merchandise sales and how you did thus far in the holiday selling area period? W. McMullen: Yes. So far, if you look, it would be kind of -- fortunately, it's a similar comment that we made earlier or, I guess, really at last quarter. So far, we would be at the top end of the range. It's broad-based in all departments, so it's across the whole store. So we feel really good. The thing that makes it a little more complicated is we haven't cycled -- we're just now starting to cycle some of the weather from a year ago. So that's one of the reasons why we would get the wide range in kind of Mike's comments earlier. Charles Cerankosky : Yes, I understand, Rodney, on the weather comparisons. That's just going to be tough to predict and deal with. But just wanted to see what the actuals look like so far. And can you... W. McMullen: And then -- and jewelry, also, is good so far. And obviously, that's one of the most discretionary areas that we have. Charles Cerankosky : I didn't know it was discretionary. J. Schlotman: I have so many comments. Charles Cerankosky : I -- also, could you repeat the private label percentages? I missed those earlier in the call. W. McMullen: Yes, Mike? Michael Ellis : Well, overall we were really pleased with the total private label sales. And our Kroger brand, which is our workhorse, showed really strong sales growth again. And in fact, all of the different banners -- brands, excuse me, really performed well, whether it's Simple Truth and Private Selection, all of those. But Corporate Brands in the third quarter represented 27.3% of total units and 25.8% of sales dollars. That's without fuel and pharmacy. Operator : Our next question is from Ajay Jain of Cantor Fitzgerald. Ajay Jain : My question is guidance related. I can understand why you might be slightly cautious in your outlook for next year if fuel margins revert to more normal levels. But your outlook for the fourth quarter, I think, is around 10% EPS growth if I use the midpoint of the range. So first, as a comment, I would have thought that the benefit from fuel could be potentially even higher in the fourth quarter based on the difference between the retail pump prices and wholesale prices and then looking at the year-over-year comparisons. So I was curious if you had any comment on that. And then, apart from fuel, are there any reasons why you're guiding to earnings growth lower in Q4 on a sequential basis? J. Schlotman: It would be primarily where fuel has been. Also, keep in mind our LIFO charge continues to go up throughout the year, and that's a bit of a headwind to earnings per share as well. And the single reason for the conversation about 2015 -- and again, I remind you we used the word if because it's difficult to project, it's really just the headwind that fuel potentially represents, 23 point -- a little over $0.23 margin on fuel. We've been in the fuel business a long time, and I personally don't remember a time where we've had anywhere near that kind of a number, and it's really difficult to predict where that may go. And again we're just -- we're trying to be transparent and let everybody know what we're thinking. W. McMullen: And what the key assumption is. J. Schlotman: Yes, what the key assumption is. Right. Ajay Jain : And as a follow-up, I think in November, you cycled the SNAP reductions from last year. Is that a material benefit at all in terms of how you're looking at it? And then are you factoring in any recent changes in the competitive environment or shift in behavior by the consumer around the holidays into your fourth quarter outlook? W. McMullen: When you look at SNAP and then you look at that customer overall, their spending may have been down on SNAP specifically, but customers are using and have been using more of their own cash. So when you look at that like customer base, it actually increased. Hopefully, that customer's increased spending in cash is driven because their economic situation's better. That, we don't know. But that's been up all year. And we continue to see the household spending for a SNAP household increase. It's not increasing at the same rate as the overall company, but it is going up. Ajay Jain : Okay. And finally, you may have mentioned this previously, but did you disclose the quarter-to-date comps, the actual figure? W. McMullen: No, we did not. J. Schlotman: Just said is... W. McMullen: At the high end. J. Schlotman: High end of our range for the quarter. Operator : Our next question is from Stacie Rabinowitz of Consumer Edge Research. Stacie  Rabinowitz: You had mentioned that you were actually thinking about specific categories for further price investment. And I was wondering if you could elaborate on those and then the extent to which either the increase in protein prices or the decrease in gas prices are changing how you're thinking about where you're investing in price? J. Schlotman: Yes, we're very guarded about our plans of where we would invest in price because we don't want to announce to our competitors where we plan to become more competitive. So we hold that very close to our vest. Stacie  Rabinowitz: Are you seeing anything so far as the gas prices are dropping in terms of shifts in where consumers are being more or less price-sensitive? J. Schlotman: Not in any big way. Operator : Our next question is from -- the last question will come from Andrew Wolf of BB&T Capital Markets. Andrew Wolf : I'll ask another natural foods question. I think you mentioned earlier on that you're seeing more conversions, people who weren't shopping, customers who weren't shopping the category coming into it. So  I want you to -- if you would, if you could, on some of your segmentation work, kind of elaborate on -- is that segment sort of driving the current growth you're seeing? And then contrast that to maybe folks who are already shopping the department and the penetration rates. And the third category, if you would address it, is there's been a prevailing theory for a long time, that consumer markets like Kroger would kind of see the natural food shopper and then, at some point, if they really converted to that lifestyle, would lose them to Whole Foods or an independent or somebody who could fulfill their whole basket. So I don't know if you're willing to talk about it, but are you trying to address that? I mean, are you seeing as they get to some point like hey, half their basket is this, and all of a sudden, they drop out? So if you would address that question, that'd be terrific to hear your response. J. Schlotman: Well, there's about 4 questions in the question. But the last piece, the folks that we have converted, I think if we can continue to offer the products selection at the prices they're willing to pay, I think we can maintain them. I don't have data that really supports if they leave and go to competitors, but some of the things we're doing around the country with vitamin shops in our stores and really well-done, expanded natural food selection offering -- and we've worked really hard on price in the whole natural and organic area too. So we are the #2 retailer for natural and organic sales today. And we just kind of continue to push hard. We love that customer, and they're really a great customer for us. W. McMullen: Andy, you shouldn't expect us to willingly give up any customer. And when you look at the products that a lot of the natural food competitors offer, you can find the exact same item at Kroger and, as a general rule, at very good value. Do you want to add? J. Schlotman: Just the last piece is, it's a large and growing segment of people who are trying to eat healthier, but they want to do so at a reasonable price. And I think, historically, it hasn't been that way. And today, you can shop for natural and organic and do it at a fairly reasonable price, and we're really trying to continue to make that offering, both selection and price. Andrew Wolf : Okay. Just to follow up because I know it was a long question, what about this trend you cited for -- is there an acceleration in new users, folks who are dabbling for the first time in... J. Schlotman: Definitely. There are people moving into the category, new customers entering natural, organic and healthy foods all the time. And again, a lot of it's because selection is better, I think, for us, and pricing is much stronger. W. McMullen: But it's kind of interesting. Some of the -- a large part of our customers that switch over is because some items, they think, taste better. So it actually is driven by the taste. And in some situations, it's driven by the innovation of the product. So it's not just exclusively people wanting to live and just buy and eat natural products and organics. It's much broader than that. It's one of things that we get excited about having a store that has a lot of flexibility in it is that we can change what's inside the store based on what the customer's needs are and how those change. So we're excited about the category, and we're excited about the potential even more. Andrew Wolf : Okay. And just on the guidance very quick. It's probably been asked, but I'll ask it again if it has. If you take out the gas this year and Harris Teeter's accretion, or at least you gave a range, it looks like you're coming in around the high end of the 8% to 11% secular growth or maybe at the high end or a little better for the core business x those 2. And if you look at guiding to next year towards the lower end, is it more normalization of sales trends and maybe inflation? Or more, hey gas is -- you can't budget gas at the same level as this year as you're just sort of putting out this broad look to the lower end as sort of early guidance? J. Schlotman: Yes, as I said earlier, if you were to look at -- if you were to strip out the core grocery business, it would be higher in the range. But when you add the fuel in, that's -- if fuel margins revert to the mean, it would be the fuel that's driving it down. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Rodney McMullen for any closing remarks. W. McMullen: Thank you. Before we end today's call, I would like to say a few words about Dave Dillon, who is listening in this morning. All of you know Dave well, and this is his last official meeting as Kroger's Chairman. Dave has been a friend and a leader to all of us and a mentor to many of us. Thousands of associates can relate to that comment. For me, personally, Dave has been a partner like no other. On behalf of the entire Kroger family, we wish Dave and his family all the best as they begin the next chapter together. Dave, thank you from all of us. Finally, I'd like to share some thoughts about our associates listening in. During the next few weeks, there will be a lot of activity in our stores as we help customers prepare for their holiday celebrations. Thank you for helping make the holidays brighter for our customers and the communities we serve and live in. During Kroger's season of giving, with your help and the help from our customers, we will donate 30 million meals to local food banks. Customers will have the opportunity to add their support by dropping change into coin boxes at check stands and donating nonperishable food in collection barrels in stores. Thank you for all that you do for our customers and each other. Merry Christmas. Happy holidays to you and your family. That completes our call today. Thanks for joining. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Cindy Holmes, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Cindy Holmes : Thank you, Laura. Good morning, and thank you for joining us.  Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our fourth quarter press release, which includes a reconciliation of certain non-GAAP measures discussed today, and our prepared remarks on this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com.  After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Rodney McMullen, Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Rodney? W. McMullen: Thank you, Cindy. And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.  With me to review Kroger's fourth quarter and full year 2014 results are Mike Ellis, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  2014 was an outstanding year for Kroger. First, let me say how proud I am to work with such a great and outstanding team of associates. Each of them deserve a round of applause for improving our connection with all customers and growing our core business right in line with our growth strategy. Second, I am pleased to report that we kept our commitments to you, our shareholders. As you know, the growth plan we first outlined in October of 2012 includes 4 key performance indicators : positive identical supermarket sales growth, slightly expanding nonfuel FIFO operating margin, growing return on invested capital and annual market share growth. In 2014, we met or exceeded each of these metrics. At the end of the year, we achieved an industry-leading 45th consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales growth without fuel. We exceeded our goal to slightly expand FIFO operating margin, without fuel, on a rolling 4-quarter basis. We improved return on invested capital even as we increased capital investment. And we captured incremental market share for the 10th consecutive year.  Strong performance means strong shareholder returns. We exceeded our long-term net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 8% to 11% in fiscal 2014, and we increased our dividend for the eighth consecutive year since we reinstated our dividend. Because we've been delivering at this level -- higher level of performance consistently and for so long, it can start to look easy or be taken for granted. It is important to know that our associates are committed to our continued success today and for the future.  We made progress on the other key elements of our growth strategy as well. We're innovating to grow. We expanded our digital capabilities to deepen our relationship with customers in new and exciting ways. More customers than ever before are engaging on our digital properties. The learnings from both our Vitacost and Harris Teeter mergers are allowing us to build an experience that gives the customer, our customers, the ability to interact with us when, where and how they want. Our corporate brand team keeps pushing the boundaries on what customers can expect from store brands. Our leading natural and organic brand, Simple Truth, hit $1 billion in annual sales for the first time and in less than 2 years after the introduction. We are investing to grow in both new and existing markets. We continue to pursue our fill-in strategy and are making great progress. Our mergers with Harris Teeter and Vitacost.com have opened new markets that present meaningful growth opportunities for Kroger.  We continue to create jobs. Today, we proudly employ nearly 25,000 more associates than we did last year at this time. Every day, we are creating opportunities for both new and current associates.  Our strong across-the-board results during fiscal 2014 allowed us to make a strategic and significant contribution to The Kroger Co. Foundation this year. We use our foundation dollars to support causes that our customers consistently tell us they care about, that enhances our reputation as a locally connected retailer. We are very proud that Forbes magazine previously recognized our work by naming us the most generous company in America. This contribution will allow Kroger to continue to support our key priorities, including hunger relief, breast cancer awareness, the military and their families and local community organizations. We are proud to make this investment to continue our efforts to support our customers and the communities that support our growth. Kroger customers are increasingly positive about the economy since late last year through the new year. They are feeling more comfortable with their discretionary spending, in part due to the low retail price of fuel. Even so, how our customers are doing today depends on the stability of their families' finances. Customers' perception of the economic recovery are still very much divided, and yet we continue to deepen loyalty with all of our customers. That is because whatever the external factors are at play at a given time, be it inflation in certain commodities, fluctuating fuel prices or unemployment, we adjust to win with the customer. So while inflation affected fuel costs through 2014, our personalized offers, weekly promotions and price investments helped customers stretch their dollars. We are currently investing $3.5 billion annually in lower prices. Even though natural and organic foods have been notoriously out of reach for many customers, we used our merchandising expertise, manufacturing base and buying power to make them affordable and accessible to all customers through Simple Truth, which continues to see double-digit sales growth. And while customers will always have evolving expectations for convenience, we have improved our prepared food offering to meet their changing needs as well.  Like a great meal, there is no single characteristic that makes Kroger great. Rather, it is the sum of its parts. It is the combination of food and drink, people and atmosphere, surprise and delight that makes a great meal great. And it is that combination of factors that our associates bring together, the sum of our parts, that explains why Kroger is so successful.  Before I turn it over to Mike Ellis, I wanted to let you know that both the Harris Teeter and Vitacost mergers are going very well, thanks to the incredible people at both companies. Mike will have more to say about these and our operational performance. Mike? Michael Ellis : Thanks, Rodney. Good morning, everyone.  This was a great quarter capping off a really great year. Our associates make everything happen, and they knocked it out of the park this year on several fronts. We achieved an outstanding fourth quarter ID sales growth, without fuel, of 6%. As Rodney pointed out in our press release this morning, while improved fuel margins contributed significantly to our reported results in the second half of the year, our operating performance without fuel shows that our associates are continuing to deepen our relationship with customers in very meaningful ways. The better our connection with customers, the better our shareholder returns.  Our identical sales performance was supported by robust performance in every department in every supermarket division. Natural foods, meat, deli and pharmacy departments all posted double-digit identical sales growth. For the 10th year in a row, we lowered costs and reinvested those savings to improve our store experience. It's no surprise that Kroger captured more share of the massive food market also for the 10th year in a row. Our consistent market share gains drive top and bottom line growth and generate lasting shareholder value. We report on market share annually and look at it as the customers would look at it, where they spend their money. Last year, we began using Nielsen point-of-sale plus, a Kroger term for Nielsen data that includes all point-of-sale data from several competitors and includes all departments inside our stores, except for pharmacy.  The data is generated by retailers who report their sales to Nielsen. This includes all major food, drug, mass and dollar competitors, as well as most club competitors. It does not include C-stores. Nielsen POS plus captures roughly 85% of the items we sell, including EPC-coded items, PLU and random-weight items, making it a really good and consistent source.  According to Nielsen POS plus data, Kroger's overall market share of the products we sell in the markets where we operate grew approximately 60 basis points during fiscal 2014. This data also indicates that our share increased in 18 of the 20 markets outlined by the Nielsen report and was down slightly in just 2 markets. Walmart is one of our top competitors in 15 of the 20 markets outlined in the Nielsen report. Kroger's share increased in all of those markets.  In addition to market share growth, we regularly measure our loyal household growth because it lets us know how well we are connecting with our best customers. During the fourth quarter, we continued to grow the number of loyal households and at a much faster rate than total household growth, which was also up for the quarter. Customers are buying fewer units per basket but visiting our stores more frequently. This is consistent with the trend for the past several quarters.  Inflation continued in pharmacy and among commodities such as meat during the fourth quarter. We estimate product inflation was 3.5%, excluding fuel, for the fourth quarter. In 2015, we expect the strong tonnage growth that we saw in the fourth quarter to continue.  We've talked a lot this year about our Corporate Brands growth and success. That trend continued in the fourth quarter, with Corporate Brands representing 28.2% of total units sold, the highest level in at least 7 years; and 25.8% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy. The star, of course, has been Simple Truth, and in 2014, Simple Truth reached an amazing milestone by hitting a $1.2 billion annual sales mark. Simple Truth has been our most successful brand launch ever, reaching billion-dollar-brand status in less than 2 short years. During the year, more than 20 million households bought 1 or more of our 2,688 Simple Truth or Simple Truth Organic items. The brand continues to earn double-digit unit and sales growth, which we don't see ending anytime soon. Shifting gears. We just completed our first year since merging with Harris Teeter, and our integration efforts have been fantastic. We are creating synergies both ways and we are learning new ways to connect with our customers. The Harris Teeter team is great, and both they and our general office teams have done an outstanding job in working together. Also, we are 6 months into the Vitacost merger, and our integration is going well. We continue to discover new ways to use Vitacost as a strategic advantage. We already have a strong national foods business, and Vitacost is helping us get better in that category. A cornerstone of our ability to deliver successful mergers is partnering with businesses that share our cultures and values. This makes it easy to share ideas between each other. Harris Teeter and Vitacost both illustrate that point. Finally, I'll provide a brief update on labor relations. We are currently negotiating in Louisville and with the Teamsters, covering several distribution and manufacturing facilities. During 2015, we will also negotiate agreements with the UFCW for store associates in Columbus; Denver; Las Vegas; Memphis; and Portland, Oregon. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good-quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continued to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, should have a shared objective : growing Kroger's business and profitably, which will help us create more jobs and more career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. We have very positive momentum with our customers, associates and communities as we move into 2015.  Now Mike Schlotman will offer more detail on Kroger's growth metrics and financial results as well as our guidance for 2015. Mike? J. Schlotman: Thanks, Mike. And good morning, everyone.  Before I share our fourth quarter and fiscal 2014 results, there are a few things to keep in mind about fiscal 2014. There are 2 items that we are adjusting our full year results for : charges incurred in the first quarter related to the restructuring of certain pension obligations to help stabilize associates' future benefits and certain tax benefits that we enjoyed in the third quarter. A lot of other things happened throughout the year as well, including low retail fuel prices and unusually high fuel margins, a LIFO charge that was significantly higher in 2014 than 2013, a $55 million contribution to our UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan in the fourth quarter. And as Rodney mentioned, we contributed $85 million to the company's charitable foundation throughout the year, $60 million of which was in the fourth quarter. Now I'll share our fourth quarter results. Please note that Kroger's operating results include Harris Teeter in the fourth quarter in fiscal 2014 but not the fourth quarter in fiscal 2013, which affects many year-over-year comparisons.  Total sales in the fourth quarter were $25.2 billion, an increase of 8.5%. Excluding fuel, total sales increased 14.2%. Net earnings for the fourth quarter totaled $518 million or $1.04 per diluted share. We recorded a $9 million LIFO charge during the quarter compared to a $10 million LIFO charge in the same quarter last year. FIFO gross margin was comparable to the same period last year, excluding retail fuel operations.  Total operating expenses, excluding retail fuel operations, the contributions to the pension and foundation and the adjustment items, decreased 15 basis points as a percent of sales compared to the same period last year.  Before I move on to discuss Kroger's full year 2014 results, I'll share some data on our fuel operations, which includes our supermarket fuel and C-store business. In the fourth quarter, our cents-per-gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.234 compared to $0.113 in the same quarter last year. For the full year, the cents-per-gallon fuel margin was roughly $0.19 compared to $0.141 last year. Going forward, we expect fuel margins to return to historical averages.  Turning now to Kroger's full year results for 2014.  Kroger reported total sales of $108.5 billion in 2014, an increase of 10.3%. Excluding fuel, total sales increased 12.9% over the prior year. Identical supermarket sales without fuel increased 5.2% in 2014 compared with the prior fiscal year. Net earnings for 2014 totaled $1.73 billion or $3.44 per diluted share. Excluding the 2014 adjustment items, net earnings for 2014 totaled $1.77 billion or $3.52 per diluted share.  It is important to note that if you look at adjusted EPS excluding fuel, it was at the high end of our long-term growth rate, even with the contributions to the pension and foundation included. So while fuel margins get a lot of attention, our nonfuel business had a spectacular year. Kroger's LIFO charge for 2014 was $147 million, significantly higher than 2013 due to higher product costs. FIFO gross margin for 2014, excluding retail fuel operations, declined 3 basis points. As Mike said, strong identical supermarket sales and cost controls allowed Kroger to reduce operating expenses as a rate of sales for our 10th consecutive year. Total operating expenses for 2014, excluding retail fuel operations, the contributions to the pension and foundation and the adjustment items, decreased 13 basis points as a percent of sales compared to the prior year. FIFO operating margin for 2014, excluding those same items, increased 10 basis points compared with the prior fiscal year. Kroger's strong EBITDA performance resulted in a return on invested capital for fiscal 2014 of 13.74% compared with 13.3 -- compared with 13.43% for fiscal 2013.  For 2015, our planned uses of cash remain unchanged : maintain our current investment grade debt rating, repurchase shares, fund the dividend and increase capital investments. In connection with our merger with Harris Teeter, we committed to getting back to a 2x to 2.2x net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio by mid- to late fiscal 2015. I'm pleased to report that we achieved our objective earlier than anticipated due to strong fiscal 2014 operating results. As of the close of the fourth quarter, net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio decreased to 2.15x compared to 2.43x during the same period last year, as described in Table 5 of the press release. Based on our current 2015 expectations, we should maintain a ratio below the 2.2x target throughout the year.  Capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, totaled $2.8 billion for the year compared to $2.3 billion in 2013. For 2015, we expect capital investments to be in the $3 billion to $3.3 billion range.  As you know, part of our long-term growth strategy is to increase capital investments over time. New store openings are meeting our expectations. We have a great pipeline of high-quality projects that we expect to allow this result to continue. We will allocate more of the spend to increase square footage in our fill-in markets. We have now identified 8 markets for fill-in opportunities. This is up from 6. Our excitement for this activity continues to grow. Kroger's strong financial position allowed the company to return more than $1.6 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. During the year, Kroger repurchased 28.4 million common shares for a total investment of $1.3 billion. As of February 27, 2015, Kroger has approximately $432 million remaining under the $500 million share repurchase authority granted in June of 2014.  Now I would like to outline our specific growth objectives for 2015.  We anticipate identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of approximately 3% to 4% for fiscal 2015. This range takes into account several factors : it's early in the year, our outlook for inflation is lower than actual inflation last year, and we expect our strong trend in unit growth to continue in 2015.  Full year net earnings for fiscal 2015 are expected to range from $3.80 to $3.90 per diluted share. This equates to Kroger's long-term net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 11 -- of 8% to 11%, growing off of 2014 adjusted earnings of $3.52 per diluted share. Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend that is expected to increase over time.  As we think about the growth in 2015, we expect fuel margins to return to historical averages. We are not planning for similar contributions to the pension or foundation, and we expect LIFO to be lower than it was in 2014. We are anticipating inflation, without fuel, of 1% to 2%, and the actual amount will be driven primarily by inflation in meat and pharmacy. So while fuel margins will be a headwind in 2015, we expect they will be offset by a lower LIFO charge, no planned contributions to the pension plan and our foundation and the continued strength in our core business.  For the full year, our expectation is that we will be in the middle portion of the range. As we look at quarter comparisons in relation to our 8% to 11% annual growth rate, we believe quarter 1 will be in the range, quarters 2 and 3 will be slightly above the range and quarter 4 will be below the range as we -- and as we expect Kroger's full year operating profit margin in 2015, excluding fuel, to expand slightly compared to 2014 results. Now I'll turn it back to Rodney. W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike.  I am so proud of our team. We fulfilled our commitments to our customers, associates, shareholders and bondholders in 2014. Kroger captured more share of the massive food market and continued to invest in growing our business. We created thousands of new jobs and hired more than 6,000 veterans last year. While we are very proud of this outstanding year, we are committed to even more. As I mentioned at our Investor Day, our to-do list remains longer than our done list.  Now we look forward to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : So guys, a few things. I think you said $3.5 billion of annual investment in price. Was that right? And what do you include in there? Is that merely price reductions, promotions or something else? Is that sustainable? Do you think you can do $3.5 billion a year? And then what happens to the elasticity of the return over time if the returns remain high on that investment? W. McMullen: Yes, that's $3.5 billion, John, that you heard us talk about. Yes, that's an annual number. And that's the annual number in 2014. Now if you look at -- obviously, we started the journey about 10 years ago of taking cost out of the business and taking that -- as we take cost out of the business, giving the customer better value both in everyday price and promotional. We would -- we see it as our strategy to continue that as we take costs out of the business. We'll continue to give that to the customer in a combination of service and price based on what we see the opportunities to be. We are very satisfied with the elasticity of the demand side as we invest in price. Obviously, we have a tremendous amount of data that we have developed internally to make sure that we're investing that in the right place where we get the best return. So we would see it sustainable, and it is part of our continued strategy. I don't know, Mike. Anything you want to add? Michael Ellis : No, I think that's it, Rodney. John Heinbockel : Okay, so as far as you can tell, there's enough things to invest in that the return will remain -- you think it will remain what it's been, as far as the eye can see, it sounds like. W. McMullen: Absolutely. And every category would have different results, and that's one of the values of our insight is understanding that. John Heinbockel : All right. And then just one for Mike Schlotman. I know you guys have liked a front-end-loaded buyback program, right, for the productivity that gives you throughout the year. Is that the idea this year? Is that sort of embedded in the guidance, that a lot of it will be done in the first half? J. Schlotman: Yes, I would say the day-to-day market conditions will wind up dictating when we make those investments, but I would point out the fact that, at the end of -- when we had our conference call in December, we had not used any of the $500 million buyback authorization. And from my comments today, we have used some now. Operator : Our next question will come from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : So I just want to start maybe with the center store trends. We've heard from a number of large CPG players just about challenges in the -- some of the center store categories. So I wanted to get a sense whether you guys are seeing the same thing. Or any more color what's happening there? Michael Ellis : Well, actually, our center store has performed better in the fourth quarter than it had in other quarters in 2014. And we've done a lot of work in relaying our center store, getting things refreshed, new products in. And it's been a big focus of us to using customer insights and really going through our stores and doing the work that's around assortment that's really effective. W. McMullen: The other thing that's -- a lot of the CPGs would have something different than what we would have is, a lot of the natural food items, do you include that in center store or a separate department? And it's getting increasingly complicated because there are certain categories where natural foods is almost as big as the historical business. So it's a short question but hard to answer. And for us, we're all -- we're completely focused on what it is the customer wants. Rupesh Parikh : And then switching gears maybe to the Simple Truth brand. You achieved your targets this year for sales of more than $1 billion. Do you have any new targets out there? And is it getting more difficult to get the supply for that business? Michael Ellis : Supply has been an issue in certain areas, but when you have over 2,600 items, we have a great base of product today, and we're going to continue to expand that. But for the most part, in some of the perishable areas, there's been a supply issue or 2, but we've been able to really take care of the customer. And I don't foresee anything this year in the near future. W. McMullen: Yes, but certain categories will always have some tightness on supply, especially at the front end, as farmers transition over to growing more of the organic or natural product. Operator : And the next question is from Meredith Adler of Barclays. Meredith Adler : Okay, I have made -- and this is a question for Mike. Do you... J. Schlotman: Which one? Meredith Adler : Right, that's right. Mike Schlotman. Question about labor negotiations. The very strong performance of the company, do you think that makes it harder for you to get the unions to go along with what you want? Or are they -- maybe a better -- bigger question is, are they pushing for wage increases? J. Schlotman: Our -- if you look at our average wage of our hourly associates in the store, it's nearly $14 an hour. And if you look at the total benefit package our associates enjoy, it's even stronger than that. It varies, obviously, by geography and particular contracts, but we've been on the forefront not only with a good solid wage. We've had -- we've been very upfront with the unions and have done a lot of things to protect the future pension benefits of our associates, what -- which others aren't doing out there. It's not just the big one we did 2 or 3 years ago. We did some more smaller ones in the first quarter this year, and it wouldn't surprise me if there'll be others that we wind up doing in the future. If you look overall, we are adding jobs. And we added 25,000 jobs last year. We're up to 400,000 jobs. One of the things that we like to say around Kroger is, a lot of people, particularly part-time workers that are under 18, they come to Kroger looking for a job, and they stay for a career. If you look around the ranks of our store managers, 2/3 of them started out as hourly, part-time hourly associates in our store. And that really just talks to the fabric of Kroger and how well we treat our associates overall. So it's more than just about the wages. There's a lot more behind the scenes of what those associates look for when they come to Kroger. W. McMullen: Plus what you make today is something different than you'll make in a -- as you get promoted throughout your career and take on more responsibility. J. Schlotman: Right. Meredith Adler : And then changing gears, maybe just talk a little bit about the test you have of click and collect in Cincinnati. Maybe it's too early to say anything, but are you feeling good about how that's going? Michael Ellis : Well, it is too early to really to say anything, Meredith, but the learnings that we have from Harris Teeter is really helping us develop our plans on how we're going to go forward. And Harris Teeter has had a very successful business for -- well, they started over 10 years ago in the click-and-collect world. And we've learned a lot, and it's really helping us accelerate our learning and growth. Operator : The next question comes from Karen Short of Deutsche Bank. Karen Short : Just a little color, I guess, following on John Heinbockel's question. In terms of share buybacks, obviously, your guidance for fiscal '15 is very strong given the tailwind that you're going to have in gas margins. So, I mean, maybe a little color on how much of this is buyback related versus core EBIT growth. I don't know if you can just elaborate a little bit on that. J. Schlotman: Yes, I won't get that granular on the model. From an expectation standpoint, you should have the expectation we'll probably spend a little bit less on share buyback during -- in terms of dollars in 2015 versus 2014. We are increasing our expectations for capital spend by a few hundred million dollars more just because of the great pipeline of projects I spoke of in the prepared comments. And that's what we think, we would believe, is the driver for growth in the future. Keep in mind, back in October of '12, we said, for the first couple of years of this new growth model, we would have 25 -- 1/4 to 1/3 of our EPS growth may come from share buybacks, but that would decline over time as we continue to open successful stores in our fill-in markets. Karen Short : Okay, that's helpful. And then just looking at the year in general. So when I look at obviously how strong this year was, can you maybe try to frame how much of that was Harris Teeter related in terms of Harris Teeter outperforming what your original guidance was on accretion? I mean, obviously, let's exclude fuel from the conversation. And then just following on that is, when we start to model comps throughout the year, any color on how we should think of how Harris Teeter, now that it's in the comp base, how that'll impact the comps throughout the year? J. Schlotman: Well, I won't give specifics on Harris Teeter. I would say that they added a little bit more to earnings per share than our original expectations for the year. They had a phenomenal year. They also helped the core Kroger with some ideas that they have done historically and helped the core Kroger have a very strong year as well. Relative to the comp cadence throughout the year, even though we only had Harris Teeter as a business for this year, we included them in our comp base all year using their 2013 sales. So the sales numbers we reported during 2014 actually included Harris Teeter as though we had owned them in 2013. So there won't be a big inflection point in ID sales from including Harris Teeter going forward. Karen Short : Even though the comps might have been pressured from investing in price? J. Schlotman: They -- again, their ID sales were included in our 2014 results, so going forward, they'll continue to be in there. W. McMullen: Karen, what I would -- I'm just going to add to Mike's thing. If you look at -- Harris Teeter delivered more than we were expecting, and that was driven because of their strong operations and synergies, but -- fuel obviously drove it, but if you look at core Kroger even without those 2 items, we still exceeded as well. So it's really all 3 pieces that drove the strong results. Operator : And next we have a question from Ed Kelly of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Edward Kelly : The first question, just for Mike Schlotman. On the cadence of the EPS growth next year, Mike, you mentioned Q1 being in line with the range for the year. I guess I would have thought that maybe it would have been better because the fuel comparison's obviously easier there. You still get the benefit from the repo in the first quarter and the share count. And then I would imagine that your comps are probably stronger earlier in the year than later. Could you just maybe help us understand why Q1 would be -- would just be in line? J. Schlotman: At this point, that's -- we had a very, very strong first quarter last year, so we are comping off of that. I agree that there will still be some residual benefit in the first quarter from the share buyback, but that was very front-end loaded last year. And we'll -- and as I said earlier, we'll buy less shares back this year than last year. So the combination of those, the way we bought it back last year did hit -- help the first quarter a bit. It's -- a lot of it winds up depending on a huge number of factors. And we just recently finalized our business plan by quarter based off of how the year wound up and what our expectations are for the various quarters. And the best answer I can give you is we're trying to be transparent about how our operators and so forth feel about the cadence throughout the year, and that's what our expectations are. There's a lot of factors that go into it. LIFO certainly will play a factor of how and when we get expense charges in the quarter. As you know, we increased our LIFO charge throughout the year and then it came down in the fourth quarter. So if our estimate for LIFO is accurate this year, second and third quarter will be helped a little bit by a lower LIFO charge as compared to the prior year. So there's lots of things that wind up going into building that model. Edward Kelly : And then just a follow-up, and this is just on your IDs generally. Your IDs typically have outpaced the industry for a very long time, but it does seem like, more recently, that this gap has widened. And I guess what I'm trying to ask you is, is there anything that you can identify, do you think, that's driven that acceleration? For instance, you saw a -- the windfall in fuel in the back half. Have you been able to use some of those proceeds to help you around the pricing front, as -- and other things that have maybe helped this acceleration in the outperformance to the industry? W. McMullen: Ed, it's a question that actually we have spent a little bit of time trying to think through internally. And probably the biggest thing is our associates, our store teams and their -- and all the people that's work our stores. They continue to do a better job of serving -- helping serve our customers on a daily basis, everything from making sure products are fresher to making sure that we treat our customers right. And we really do believe we had a great foundation in place, and our associates really are taking it up to the next level in terms of how they're taking care of our customers. And we think that that's what's -- the thing that's really been successful, and we really appreciate what our associates are doing. Operator : The next question is from Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley. Vincent Sinisi : Wanted to ask about natural organic, which as you mentioned, of course, continues to see some nice growth, Simple Truth being the main contributor to that. But outside of Simple Truth, can you give any other color in terms of maybe some other category or brand growth within it? And in particular, maybe any early just color around Vitacost, any cross-selling or expansion there? Michael Ellis : Great question. Within natural foods, there are so many categories that customers are connecting with today that get stronger and stronger, from dairy products, gluten-free. We can go on and on. And our ability to cross-merchandise some of those products throughout the store, I think, has made some of those products more available in a broader way to a larger customer base. We keep talking about the blurring of departments, and natural foods is becoming more and more mainstream for many people. So it's really broad based when you look at where the growth is. And we're trying all kinds of new things to make these types of products more available to our customers every day. On Vitacost, we love what we have. And it's a solid platform, and we plan to do other things with that over time. And I think you'll be seeing some things in the near future. Vincent Sinisi : Okay, all right, fair enough. And then just as a follow-up maybe switching over quickly to Harris Teeter. Are all Harris Teeter stores now having the click-and-collect capability? And also, I know that you started in your Harris Teeter banner in one region. Any further plans for rollout that you could talk to for this year, this coming year? Michael Ellis : Well, we are doing a -- we're still at beta test in 1 store here in Cincinnati, but at Harris Teeter, we're at about 160-some stores that are currently offering that to the customer. And I'll tell you what, the growth is exciting. Customers love the service, and the numbers continue to grow. We're setting new records at Harris Teeter all the time on more customers shopping this -- in this way. And it's a big part of our strategy going forward. Operator : And next we have a question from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : So my question is actually more strategic. As we kind of take a step back, you said a couple things, $3.5 billion of investment in price kind of ongoing. I think, Mike Schlotman, you said you pushed up that CapEx growth rate a little bit again, so my question really goes to the top line growth of this organization. I mean, is it time we accelerated it further? It seems like it's gone on a little bit, but I mean, is it time we continue to push? I was talking to one investor, who said, \"Kroger is kind of the Costco of the grocery industry at this stage, where they continuously reinvest.\" So what's your thought? I mean, is the growth rate -- what should we think of as an ongoing top line growth rate? Can it go higher? How do we get it higher? Is this something the company is thinking about? W. McMullen: Well, Scott, it's a great question. And it's certainly something we think about. And the investor you were talking to, please pass along our appreciation for the compliment because we have a great deal of respect for Costco. We think about it a lot. In terms of -- I guess, I would really say, use your model to figure out how to accelerate the growth. As you know, we continue to accelerate the number of new stores, and we continue to try to make sure that our identical store sales stay strong. So I think that would automatically cause a continuation of an increasing growth rate, but we've spent a tremendous amount of energy and efforts on trying to accelerate our growth at a pace that makes sense for our organization. And one of the keys is we have to make sure we develop associates to be able to handle the accelerated growth as well. Scott Mushkin : And since there -- and we've talked about this before, Rodney, and I appreciate that answer. There's kind of become a Kroger way, a Kroger model driven by, I think, your just advantage in big data. How do you get that model into more consumers' hands in markets maybe that you're not in? I mean it -- you really haven't expanded. I guess Harris Teeter did it for you, but I mean, do you agree that there's a superior model now and it would be advantageous for the company to bring it to more markets? W. McMullen: I was going to answer the question until you said the last part. The... J. Schlotman: We'll still let him answer, though. W. McMullen: The -- I -- we wouldn't ever think that we have a superior way. And all we're really focused on is how to get a little bit better tomorrow than we were yesterday. And for us, that would probably be the biggest part of the Kroger way is really trying to understand what the customers' wants and needs are and trying to get a little bit better at delivering against those. The -- and over time, and numerous times, we've said, anything that's available out there, you should assume that we've looked at it. And it's really making sure that we find something that adds value for our shareholders and something that we think the teams fit in well with Kroger and we can do something for the customer that they don't already have. And when you look at Harris Teeter, it checked all those boxes. And the Harris Teeter team was just amazing, but on smaller scale, Vitacost has been the same way. And a real small scale, YOU Tech has been the same thing. So it's really we're constantly trying to look at things that add new growth for us. Operator : And next we have a question from Robert Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Robert Ohmes : I was hoping you -- sort of a broad follow-up question from what everybody else has been asking. 2014, you guys have characterized as a somewhat unusually good year. Can you sort of walk us through some of the things that could continue, sort of puts and takes on 2015, and why or why not it could or could not be another unusually kind of good year? And sort of the areas I was hoping you would cover is things like the comp contribution from natural foods. Is that slowing in 2015 versus 2014? The competitive environment seemed to maybe be a little less competitive in 2014 for a lot of food retailers. What does that feel like right now as you look out? And then maybe a little more color on the puts and takes on inflation. Is there anything that could keep inflation from decelerating sequentially as you move through the year? And then the fourth part would be customer trade-up. Was that a significant support to your accelerating comps in 2014? And could that continue in 2015 as a driver? J. Schlotman: Okay, one very long question. If I ask you to repeat parts of those -- I was trying to scribble them down. And as everybody here at Kroger knows, when I write slowly, it's hard to read my penmanship. Rodney took them -- took better notes, apparently. The first point on what -- the broad question. We obviously get very thoughtful and step back pretty far when we think about where we should set our expectations for a particular year. We become very careful and protective of the overall business model that we've developed, and that's focused on the customer as front and center. And as we decide what EBITDA growth rate and earnings per share growth rate is appropriate to ask our divisions and our different operating units to generate during a particular fiscal year, that's first and foremost. We really don't start necessarily with, \"Here is what the answer has to be.\" It's, \"What can the answer be? And how do we actually build a model that winds up generating that?\" From a comp standpoint, there's numbers of factors that can go into where the IDs can wind up being. One of those that you mentioned was inflation. We are expecting a little bit less inflation. That said, as you know, we have a very large and robust pharmacy business. That was a huge driver of the LIFO charge this year. Where that winds up in 2015 is purely a guess at this point. As I've said oftentimes, if we've done nothing else, the ability to predict the LIFO charge is something that is difficult, at best. You mentioned competition. I don't think competition is benign by any stretch of the imagination, but I'd say it's relatively consistent. It's always highly competitive. You never know what a competitor is going to do. We certainly assume that the current competitive condition is not going to get better than it is today. And it's always been a highly competitive industry. There's always new people trying to take part of your business that have different operating models, whether it's a Sprouts or those kinds of operators; or Publix coming into Charlotte like they have, trying to take part of Harris Teeter's business. And we build a model to defend our turf no matter where those folks try to come. When you look at customer trade-up, I would say it's somewhat -- there's a lot of things out there that are affecting broad customer base. Certainly, I think we probably would have seen some trade-up from the customer who has been less affected by the downturn in the economy over the last several years, probably spending a little bit more money in a variety of outlets, certainly some of ours. I would say, that customer who's been on a budget for the last several years, they probably aren't spending a whole lot more money on being big contributors to a consumer-driven economy. They're probably able to take care of some of the bills that they manage on a monthly basis, trying to remember which one they're going to push off for a little while. And they probably have been able to be a little bit more current on their bills but not a whole lot more disposable income. So it's a pretty big mixed bag out there. The -- certainly, the -- where fuel costs are going to wind up and a whole lot of other factors enter into it, but it's -- I know I've been going on for a bit here, but it's a long and difficult -- one, the question was long, but it's -- there's not a precise answer to say, \"It's A and B, and that's what drives the final answer.\" We've taken lot of factors as we plan the year and think about how it's going to wind up being. Robert Ohmes : That's very helpful, Mike. Just the one area, just the one last area that I want to ask about. So on natural foods, you guys had big increases in square footage allocation to that space, very noticeable the last couple of years. I think that's slowed a lot. Should we expect less tailwind from natural foods to your comps in 2015 versus what you'd seen in the last couple of years? Michael Ellis : I think you're going to continue to see great growth in natural foods. It's more a way of life for our customer today. W. McMullen: Yes. The other thing is that, in certain categories, we're starting to integrate it rather than putting it in a separate space as well. Operator : And next we have a question from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Kenneth Goldman : A couple. Can you help us a bit with how QTD comp trends are proceeding either quantitatively or qualitatively? And I guess, similarly, on 1Q fuel margins to date, any sort of flow-through margin help? Or have retail prices come down enough to maybe offset wholesale ones by this point? W. McMullen: If you look at our identical sales so far this quarter, and obviously it's very early in the year because we're just a few weeks into the year, it would be slightly ahead of where we -- the guidance we gave. But it's very early in the year. On fuel margins, I'll -- Mike, we'll have to let you answer that one because I don't know the answer to that one. J. Schlotman: Yes, I don't think we need to talk about weekly fuel margins. It's difficult enough to predict what the year is going to be, let alone 4 or 5 weeks, because it's such a volatile area and just won't go down that path this morning. Kenneth Goldman : That's fair. And my follow-up is you're guiding to inflation being about 1.5% lower than it was in '14. You're talking about maybe a roughly 1.5% deceleration in total ID sales x fuel. So always risky embarrassing myself asking a simple math question, but is it fair to assume your guidance is thus implying that everything outside passing along inflation, like sort of traffic and basket size, you're expecting that to grow at a similar rate in '15 as '14, roughly? J. Schlotman: Yes, as Mike Ellis said in his remarks, we had great tonnage growth throughout the year, and it accelerated a little bit in the fourth quarter. And we don't see any reason why that would slow down during the year. And it's it winds up being in our hands to continue that underlying unit growth. Operator : The next question comes from Kelly Bania of BMO Capital Markets. Kelly Bania : Just first, wanted to double check on guidance. So I think the message for next year is you had the very strong benefit from the fuel margins in the back half, but you have lower LIFO, no -- none of the pension. You don't cycle that pension expense again next year and the foundation expense. And so net-net, you still can kind of maintain that 8% to 11% earnings growth, but it sounds like fuel still may be somewhat of a headwind. So I don't know if you can maybe parse out the net impact of those factors that were kind of swing factors this year just to help us kind of think about how -- the guidance for 2015. J. Schlotman: Yes, you -- if you look at where fuel margins benefited us, and we talked about what the fuel margins were for the year, you know roughly what our gallons are over time, so you can probably figure out the incremental benefit from a margin standpoint on fuel. So if you think about that normalizing and then LIFO being -- expectation being lower, not having the pension contribution or the contribution to the charitable foundation, they don't perfectly offset one another but they come close to being -- negating one another, and that's why we're growing off of the $3.52 at the 8% to 11%. Keep in mind, all of that information aside, our core operations without those would have been at the high end of our 8% to 11% range all by themselves last year. And it's really that underlying strength in the core business that gives us the comfort to be able to have another great year in the 8% to 11% range. Kelly Bania : Perfect, that's very helpful. And then just on the comps for the quarter. I think, when you were planning the comps for the quarter in Q3, you talked about cycling the benefit from the weather. Just curious what really came in better than expected for the fourth quarter in terms of those core ID comps. Was there a weather benefit? Or did you just kind of hang onto some of those customers that maybe were pushed into your stores last year with the weather? Or just curious, thoughts there. W. McMullen: Yes, we -- the weather would not have been as helpful this year as it was prior year. So it was really hanging onto some of those customers and really the operating and merchandising teams doing a great job of making sure that we had strong programs to cycle that weather. So it was really the team executing and doing a great job. J. Schlotman: Okay. And we'll take one more question. Operator : Okay, and that final question will come from Mark Wiltamuth of Jefferies. Mark Wiltamuth : Wanted to get some thoughts on, now that you're contemplating more of these fill-in markets, what should we be thinking about for a longer-term square footage growth rate for you? Because you have been fading off of your store closures, so I'm curious what the flow-through is going to be on actual net square footage growth. J. Schlotman: Yes, it's really difficult to predict exactly how many operational closings you're going to have in a particular year. And there's a wide variety of reasons those happen, but if you look at our gross, we expect it to be 2% to 2.5% next year. Our net was a little bit under 1% last year. Our store count has been down. Keep in mind, sometimes when we close an underperforming store, we may be closing an underperforming store, it's underperforming because its sales per square foot are at the way low end of a range of what would make that store profitable. And as we replace that store or open a new store that's larger than that, the net square footage may not go up dramatically, but the sales per square foot of that new store can often be several multiples of the store we closed. So it's a little misleading just to say, \"Oh, square footage growth hasn't been that much so they can't grow sales that much.\" The difference between that productivity of the new store and the store we closed can be quite remarkable sometimes. Mark Wiltamuth : Okay. And were there any tax implications from the charitable contribution in the fourth quarter, or anything that carries into 2015? J. Schlotman: No. Obviously, we got a tax deduction for that, but it didn't affect the tax rate in any way, shape or form. And we've just taken advantage of the opportunity of a very strong year to be able to continue to have dollars to support the efforts that we support, both that are important to us and are important to our customers. W. McMullen: I want to thank everybody for calling in today and listening to our call. And before we end the call, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today.  I'd like to thank all of our associates for their hard work and dedication in serving our customers. We finished 2014 strong, thanks to your commitment in providing friendly service and fresh products to our 8 million customers every time, every day. Thank you to each and every one of you for making a difference with our customers and for each other.  As many of you know, our community service awards honor and recognize our associates who, through their widespread volunteer activity, charitable involvement and leadership, make a difference in the communities where we live, work and raise our families. Nominations for our 2014 community service awards are now being accepted. Whether you support the hungry, veterans and active-duty military, cancer awareness or your favorite local organization, I encourage you to apply and -- or nominate a coworker for this prestigious award. Winners from each division will receive a donation to their charity of choice. Make sure you connect with your HR manager for more information and nomination deadlines in your division.  Thank you for all you do. Your work in our communities is simply amazing.  That completes our call for today. Thanks for joining. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Cindy Holmes, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Cindy Holmes : Thank you, Laura. Good morning, and thank you for joining us.  Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially.  A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our first quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. W. McMullen: Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining our call today. With me to review Kroger's first quarter 2015 results are Mike Ellis, Kroger's President and Chief Operating Officer; and Mike Schlotman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  Kroger delivered strong first quarter sales and earnings results, and we are pleased with our start for the year. We achieved our 46th consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales growth. We exceeded our goal to slightly expand FIFO operating margin without fuel on a rolling 4-quarter basis, and we continue to invest and innovate to grow our business, expanding our use of technology and our digital capabilities. Kroger has produced consistently remarkable results for so long that it might be easy to take a quarter like this for granted, but these results don't happen accidentally. They happen because we lead and drive our business toward these goals. Customer 1st and our 4 keys : our people, products, shopping experience and pricing, remains our fundamental strategy. We strive for balance across these 4 keys, and each quarter, we do a little better in each. And when we do that consistently for as long as we have, our results are more powerful. Based on the strength of our first quarter results, we are raising our identical supermarket sales growth guidance for the year, and we are on track to deliver our long-term net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 8% to 11%, plus the dividend, in 2015. One of the ways we continuously improve the shopping experience is by bringing new technology and digital capabilities to our business. Mike Ellis will provide an update on several digital efforts in a moment, but I wanted to mention what I think is a great example of how we're expanding our use of technology. Our recent decision to establish 84.51\u00b0, which replaced our previous joint venture, dunnhumbyUSA, 84.51\u00b0 is helping us to continue to use data science for the benefit of our customers and to deliver a more personalized experience, both in store and online. We are so excited to welcome the talented associates at 84.51\u00b0 to the Kroger team, and we are already beginning to see their daily involvement in the business helping to accelerate our efforts. Just little things, like 84.51\u00b0 CEO Stuart Aitken participating in our senior officer meetings is making a big difference. We expect 84.51\u00b0 to be an innovation engine and a game changer for Kroger and our customers. We are pleased to see the economy moving in the right direction, albeit as we've mentioned for several quarters, slowly. One of the important ways we are able to deliver so consistently is that we offer attractive values for all customers all the time. When you want to splurge, you can splurge. When you want to save, you can do that, too. So while Murray's Cheese, Starbucks and Boar's Head, for example, are performing very well, so are our entry-level price point brands. Now I will turn it over to Mike Ellis to outline our operational performance. Mike? Michael Ellis : Thank you, Rodney. Good morning, everyone. Our associates continue to deliver an exceptional experience in ways that make a difference for our customers. Over the past year, more customers have noticed improvements in Kroger's product selection, product freshness and customer service. Our strong identical supermarket sales growth was primarily driven by an increase in the number of households shopping with us in the first quarter. We also met our goal to grow the number of loyal households at even a faster rate than total household growth again in the quarter. We're especially proud of our loyalty and sales results when you consider the current operating environment that we're in, which has less certainty than normal. We are addressing the volatility we see out there every day. Fuel margins, for example, have returned to normal compared to where we ended last year. Another factor is product costs. Some commodities are up, some are down. We are seeing deflation in milk, produce and seafood, which is driving more tonnage volume. Milk is one of our most price-elastic categories that we have. When milk prices come down, people tend to buy a lot more. We're at an advantage because we have a vertically integrated supply chain for milk. When our dairy plants run at higher volume, we become more efficient and productive. We continue to see inflation in generic pharmaceuticals and in certain commodities in the meat department. Overall, inflation continued, but at a lower rate during the first quarter, which is in line with what we had expected. Tonnage growth was very strong during the first quarter. In fact, we saw the strongest first quarter tonnage performance since 2010, which is a clear indication of our ability to get pricing right for our customers. If you look back over the past several years, we've had periods of high and low inflation, and we've shown that regardless of the environment, we will deliver greater value and convenience for our customers. Corporate Brands had a solid first quarter, accelerating company sales growth and representing approximately 26.9% of total units sold and 25.4% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy. A key driver of sustainable growth is Customer 1st innovation, and as Rodney said, we are actively expanding Kroger's use of technology, which we see as a catalyst for improving our connection with customers and growing our market share. Kroger's digital team has developed a popular mobile app that our customers use millions of times each week. In April, we were one of the first food retailers to release an app that is compatible with the Apple Watch. And this month, we reached a new milestone, more than 2 billion digital coupons have been downloaded from our digital properties since we began offering digital coupons in 2009. It took 4 years to reach our first billion and only 15 months to reach our second billion, and the third billion will take even less time. Also this month, our Cincinnati division began inviting local customers to try our order online, pick up at the store solution we are learning from Harris Teeter, which we have been beta testing for a few months and is now available in 2 of our Cincinnati area stores to all customers. Our integration with Vitacost.com continues to go very well, and just this week, Vitacost helped us launch a new natural and organic e-commerce website called King Soopers Live Naturally that is open to King Soopers customers who live in and around the Denver Metro area. The website, which utilizes Vitacost's technology platform and fulfillment network, creates an endless aisle experience with ship-to-home service for thousands of additional health foods, vitamins, minerals and supplements that are available in our Denver area stores today. We are excited to see the results of this new pilot program.   And now I will provide a brief update on labor relations. We recently agreed to new contracts in both Las Vegas and Louisville, and we agreed to a Master Agreement with the Teamsters covering several distribution and manufacturing facilities. Four of the 5 Teamster locals have also ratified this agreement. We are currently negotiating contracts with the UFCW for store associates in Columbus, Denver, Memphis and Portland. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions which represent many of our associates should have a shared objective : growing Kroger's business, and profitably, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. Before I turn it over to Mike Schlotman, I'd like to say a little more about the culture of opportunity we work hard to create here at Kroger. Being a Kroger associate means being part of our family, part of something bigger. Every day, we hire people who come to Kroger for a job, then decide to stay for a career. In fact, 2/3 of our store managers today started as an hourly clerk, stocking shelves or bagging groceries. We continue to increase our investment in training to build skills so our associates are ready for opportunities to advance and lead others. We offer so much more than a job, a chance to connect with their community, to be part of a giant team stretching from coast to coast and to work with colleagues who want to make a difference, too. We think this opportunity culture is a differentiator for us today and will continue to be into the future. Now Mike Schlotman will offer more detail on Kroger's financial results and update our guidance for 2015. Mike? J. Schlotman: Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our results for the quarter in each of the key performance target areas for our long-term growth plan. Our first metric is identical supermarket sales without fuel. We are pleased with our first quarter identical supermarket sales growth of 5.7%. This strong performance was supported by identical supermarket sales growth in every department and every supermarket division. We continue to see outstanding double-digit identical sales growth in our natural foods department. Our meat, deli and pharmacy departments also posted strong identical supermarket sales growth. Rolling 4 quarters FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel, the 2014 and 2013 adjustment items and the contributions to the pension and foundation in the third and fourth quarters of 2014 increased by 10 basis points. This exceeded our commitment to grow the rate slightly over time on a rolling 4 quarters basis. Return on invested capital on a rolling 4 quarters basis was 14.03%. We are not presenting a comparative number this quarter because the prior year first quarter calculation does not include a full year of Harris Teeter assets and results. We do expect return on invested capital for fiscal 2015 to increase slightly from the fiscal 2014 result. This is an important metric as we continue to increase our capital investment to drive our future growth. Now I'll share our first quarter 2015 results in more detail. As you know, we don't provide guidance for total sales because of the unpredictability of fuel margins on our results. Total sales in the first quarter increased 0.3% to $33.1 billion compared to $33 billion for the same period last year. Excluding fuel, total sales increased 6.4% for the first quarter compared to the same period last year. In the first quarter, our net earnings totaled $619 million or $1.25 per diluted share. Kroger's net earnings during the first quarter last year included charges related to the restructuring of certain pension obligations to help save -- stabilize associates' future benefits. Excluding the effect of those charges, Kroger's adjusted net earnings in the same period last year were $557 million or $1.09 per diluted share. We recorded a $28 million LIFO charge during the first quarter, consistent with the same quarter last year. We raised our annual estimate to $90 million from $75 million, primarily due to pharmacy inflation. FIFO gross margin, excluding retail fuel operations, decreased 7 basis points from the same period last year. Strong identical supermarket sales growth and cost control has allowed Kroger to leverage operating expenses as a rate of sales in the first quarter. Total operating expenses, excluding retail fuel operations and pension agreements, decreased 15 basis points as a result of sales compared to the prior year. This really does demonstrate the leverage of strong ID sales as we simultaneously invested in areas other than price to provide a continually improving shopping experience for our customers, but leveraged our ID sales to drive the rate down. Now for retail fuel operations. In the first quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.116 compared to $0.131 in the same quarter last year. Our long-term financial strategy continues to be repurchase shares, have an increasing dividend, fund increasing capital investments and maintain our current investment grade debt rating. Our strong financial position has allowed us to return $1.1 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last 4 quarters. During the quarter, Kroger repurchased 8 million common shares for a total investment of $585 million. Capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, totaled $915 million for the first quarter compared to $709 million for the same period last year. We continue to expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to be in the $3 billion to $3.3 billion range for the year. Our planned increased capital investment on an annual basis remains in place. We are pleased with the early returns from these investments, and we continue to have a long list of strong projects that will compete for these investments. The company's net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio decreased to 2.09 compared to 2.40 during the same period last year. Kroger's net total debt is $11.3 billion consistent with last year. It's constructive to understand that we have maintained our absolute debt level while returning $1.1 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last 4 quarters and investing $3 billion in capital on a rolling 4-quarter basis, plus an additional $411 million on mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities. In other words, we're keeping our commitments to our bondholders and our shareholders. Now I'd like to update our growth objectives for 2015. Based on our strong first quarter results, we raised our identical supermarket sales growth guidance, excluding fuel, to a range of 3.5% to 4.5% for 2015. The original guidance was 3% to 4%. We're confirming our net earnings guidance range of $3.80 to $3.90 per diluted share for 2015. This range is within our long-term net earnings per diluted share growth guidance of 8% to 11%. Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend expected to increase over time. As we look at quarter comparisons in relation to our 8% to 11% annual growth rate, we believe that quarter 2 will be slightly above the range, quarter 3 will be at the high end of the range and quarter 4 will be below the range. For the full year, we expect to be within the range, and it is still somewhat dependent on where fuel margins shake out. Now I will turn it back to Rodney. W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike. This is another terrific quarter. Our associates are making a difference for our customers by providing excellent service and product quality and selection. As I said earlier, results like this don't happen by accident. We create these results by connecting with our customers through our powerful Customer 1st Strategy. When we take care of our customers, we create sustainable value for our shareholders. Now we look forward to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Ed Kelly of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Edward Kelly : So my first question, I guess, is just related to the guidance. So I guess, maybe more for Mike, but you obviously raised your ID guidance for the year. You had a good, strong quarter but you maintained the EPS guidance. So I'm just kind of curious, at this point, is it just early and you want to be conservative? Or are there other incremental offsets that are maybe new? J. Schlotman: It's a variety of factors, Ed, and one, it is early in the year. And as we said in both the release and in the prepared comments, the operating environment's a bit volatile right now. There's a lot of volatility in fuel prices. They've obviously come in very quickly to a more normal range from where the range was at the end of the year last year. We know that will be a headwind in the fourth quarter. It was baked into our original 8% to 11%. Our actual first quarter results, while ahead of The Street, were just a little bit over the 8% to 11% range, and we had expected to be the near the high end of the range ourselves, which was our original guidance on cadence. And then just the volatility of inflation that's out there. While we've seen some categories with deflation, we know that pharmacy inflation is actually as high as it's been over the last several years. In the first quarter, it's right at double digits. And then a little bit of concern or thought process about the avian virus with the poultry flocks and how that might affect input costs later in the year and what's going to happen with availability of those products. So when we stepped back and thought about it, while we're pleased with the first quarter, we thought the most prudent move given the uncertainty -- or the volatility of some of the things out there was to maintain our guidance range. We had guided in March that if fuel margins came in, it may put us at the low end. We aren't saying we're going to be at the low end, but we're maintaining the range because that actually has happened with fuel. Edward Kelly : And Mike, historically, you've kind of said about $0.14 or so a gallon in fuel. Obviously, this quarter's lower, but kind of like the slope of the curve was rising. Is there anything else that's changed in the marketplace or maybe it's become a bit more competitive, where you're a little concerned about the $0.14? J. Schlotman: I -- we -- I wouldn't say we've focused on any one number. Our practice on fuel is to follow the market, and then give our most loyal customers a really good value on fuel by the -- our fuel rewards program, which I'll remind everybody the cost of that reduces our ID sales, it doesn't reduce the fuel margin. And it's really just what's happening in the marketplace as we follow the marketplace and stay right on The Street price and the signs but then give that incremental reward. I wouldn't say there's anything unusual in the first quarter. Any short period of time in fuel is an interesting result but a longer period of time is what's more important. W. McMullen: And we -- internally, we usually use a rolling 4-quarter number. This year, we didn't just because of how strong fuel margins were in the third and fourth quarter. And as Mike mentioned, on a daily basis, we're probably never right, but usually over the year, it gets pretty close. Operator : The next question will come from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : So I just wanted to follow up a little more just on inflation. For this upcoming year, have you guys changed your inflation forecast? J. Schlotman: Yes, we're still expecting it to be in the 1% to 2% range. We're actually at the high end of that range in the first quarter, a lot of that driven by the pharmaceutical inflation that Mike mentioned -- or we mentioned in the prepared comments, primarily in the generic arena. So that's out there. We do expect to see some potential inflation out there in the poultry flocks as the avian flu issue hits. We don't know what's going to happen with all of the input ingredients that go into products from liquid eggs and how that might affect a lot of products that contain that as an ingredient. So we think that 1% to 2% is right. So far, that's what we're seeing. Rupesh Parikh : Okay, thanks for the color. And then switching topics, maybe to your competition. We hear a lot about capacity growth in the specialty grocery arena and even some -- even I guess, more commentary out there on the hard discount channel. What are you seeing right now from competitor openings in, I guess, from a full-service grocery perspective? W. McMullen: Well, from a full service, I guess, I would say it's probably been pretty consistent over the last 3 or 4 years. Not -- certainly not aggressive. Certainly, if you look at the niche merchants, there would be much higher growth there, but we consider everybody a competitor. So we don't -- we wouldn't segment it as different as what probably most people would think we would. Operator : The next question is from Karen Short of Deutsche Bank. Karen Short : So I'm just curious on, well, maybe this is just semantics, Mike, and maybe I'm overreading, but just to clarify on your guidance by quarter, you said just now that 3Q, you expect it to be at the high end of your guidance? I think last quarter you said it would be slightly above? J. Schlotman: Yes, if you look at second and third quarter, actually I think second quarter we said at high end and third quarter above. We just flip flopped those a little bit. It takes $8 million flipping between quarters to do that, and it's just our best thinking today. So it doesn't affect the year. I think if you look back to what we just said in March, the guidance on those 2 quarters just flipped between quarters. We still expect a very strong year. Karen Short : Okay. And then on tonnage, I don't know if you guys would be willing to give an actual percent tonnage number. And then, I guess, following on that, I guess, when I look at O&A, your O&A growth rate definitely seemed higher than what I would have expected. I know in the past, we -- you talked about tonnage impacting that number, but maybe just some color on those 2. J. Schlotman: Yes, relative to tonnage, we won't give an actual number. As Mike said in his prepared comments, it was the strongest we've had since 2010, and we haven't given a specific number, but we're very pleased with where it is. If you think about in the comments I made on OG&A, we're very pleased with the leverage we've got of 15 basis point reduction in that as a rate of sales. We did make conscious decisions to invest in other keys of our 4 key strategy versus price to provide a better shopping experience to our customers, both through making sure the products are on the shelves in a timely basis, having our associates friendly and we keep our products as fresh as possible. So there was some conscious decision to invest in incremental services for our customers, which provides more jobs and hours for our associates as well. W. McMullen: The other thing on tonnage, we always try to give an outline of where we are and how it feels, but it's very hard to calculate. And when a customer buys a 24 unit of something versus a 12 unit of something in our -- internally, we count that as one and one. J. Schlotman: Or water, the common package for bottled water today is 32 bottles. It used to be 24. That's still a unit. W. McMullen: It's not that we're trying to avoid the question. It's just that it's -- there's an awful lot of assumptions behind that, and what we try to do is give everybody a general feel for what's going on. Karen Short : Okay. And then just on the ClickList, I guess, in Cincinnati. I mean, obviously I know you guys are always very conservative and want to make sure your customer is getting the best experience, but it definitely seemed like it was a pretty long test phase. So I guess, maybe can you maybe clarify or give some color on what you ironed out, and what made you feel comfortable to roll it out now, and how quickly you think you could accelerate that? W. McMullen: Yes, the length of the test would seem long just because it became public a lot faster than we had intended to because somehow, one of the newspaper folks that follow us found the actual website that we were testing with our associates. So it's not that it was longer than normal. It's just that it was public longer than what we normally would. It's tracking -- if you look at our original plan, we're tracking on exactly where we thought we would be on the original plan, and feel good about it. And then Mike just pointed out to me, we just added our second store, I guess it was this week or last week. J. Schlotman: And again that's in a beta test and you kind of have to know it's there. It's a new experience for us, and we just want to make sure it's right. Operator : And next we have a question from Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley. Vincent Sinisi : I wanted to ask you first about really the private label, in particular the Simple Truth, if you could just give us a quick update in terms of where that brand is today? If over the first quarter there had been any updates in terms of product expansion and how big that particular segment is for you right now. Michael Ellis : The brand, we're very pleased with. I think you'll find around 2,600 SKUs in our stores today and talk about connecting with the customer in a meaningful way. They have taken the brand and really embraced the brand. For us, it's been not only strategic, but it's really lining up with what customers are looking for today. And you can also buy it now on Vitacost.com. And it's available there also, so anybody who -- even if you don't shop in a Kroger market, you're able to get the product today. But no, we've been totally -- completely pleased with the progress we're making, and there are many more new items to come. Vincent Sinisi : Okay. And then maybe just as a follow-up, sticking with the natural segment, as you're continuing to learn the Vitacost division and as you're -- as you mentioned, you have the Soopers site now up, have you had any further progress? I know it's still admittedly pretty early, but have you had any further progress that you could share with us in terms of maybe bringing some more of those products that had historically been Vitacost into some of your other banners? Michael Ellis : Well, today, we have a pretty good selection of natural foods, supplements, body building products, health care products in our stores. Vitacost really just helps us fulfill that long tail of items that are smaller in some cases, and on the King Soopers website now, you can pick up 25,000 to 30,000 additional SKUs than what you'd find in a typical Kroger store. So it's really helped us take natural foods, natural products to the customer in a much broader way. We're really pleased with where we're headed. There's a lot of work still to do. We're approaching our first anniversary with Vitacost next month, and so we're actually moving pretty fast as a company and we're pleased with where we're headed. Operator : The next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : So Rodney, I want to start with -- you put up a quarter like this, but I know you guys can be somewhat self-critical. When you step back and say, from a skill set standpoint or a business line standpoint, where are you still not where you want to be in a significant way, not we're 90% of the way there but we have a lot of work to do? And then as part of that, address maybe the issue of speed to market and that being a more important skill set to work on over the next couple of years. W. McMullen: The shortest hard question to answer, and when I did my own performance review with our Board, somebody asked the same question. And you've followed Kroger for a long time, and you realize when you look at our culture overall, we're always very proud of what we've accomplished. But at the same time, we feel like we have a tremendous opportunity to get better, and a lot of times, we like to use the words that our to-do list is longer than our done list. And when you look at what's out in front of us, we are incredibly excited about the opportunities that we see to continue to get better. And the hardest thing that we have to do is actually make sure that we're trying not to improve on all things at once, but what are the things that are most important to the customer and put all our resources against that. So I guess that the way I would say overall is obviously, we're delighted with the quarter, delighted with the progress we're making. We're even more excited about the opportunity to continue to get better. So I feel very good about where we are, but I feel even better about the opportunities we have in front of us. John Heinbockel : But are there certain -- there have to be, right, certain product categories -- I don't want to get into geographic differences, but certain product categories, businesses, customer groups that you're not fully resonating with yet, it'd have to be those, and what would tie those together, if anything? W. McMullen: It's -- probably I'm trying to think of the easiest way to answer your question because it's a very good question. The -- it's more opportunity. So if you think about like apparel, where you just -- we've added apparel to, I don't know, I think we're up to 70-some marketplace stores. We're still learning what is the right selection of product to have that's in a marketplace store. Obviously, the Fred Meyer Group helps us get insight and procures the product for us through that channel, but we're still learning what's the right things to put in. And there's a ton of those kind of things going on, so it's really hard to say we're -- there's one specific item or one specific customer. It's much broader than that, and it's 100 different things versus just one thing that we're really trying to get better at. John Heinbockel : All right. And then just lastly, when you think about pricing, right, and pricing being a journey, it looks to me like, whether it's traditional competitors or mass, there's been some stabilization with regard to pricing, right? It's not a race to the bottom. Is that fair? And at this point, you're largely where you need to be. And the adjustments to come, is it -- do you think it's more kind of rifle -- you sort of look at maybe the hard discounters and work to be done on private label pricing, but are we stable and largely there and it's just selective guys you've got to address at this point? W. McMullen: If you look at longer term on pricing, as you know, over the last several years, we've invested in price as we reduced OG&A to take costs out of the business. The last few quarters, we have been a little more aggressive in investing in service. So it's not just price based. So if you look at the mix of where we invest, we have invested some of that cost reduction in additional service hours and things like that. So it's a journey that you never arrive at a destination, so you're continually making progress, and you continually change based on your competitive -- your competitors change as well. So we're happy where we are, but we are continuing to invest but it's really driven by as we get costs out of the business. I don't know if, Mike, anything you'd want to add to that? J. Schlotman: No, I absolutely agree. It's right in sync with the prepared comments we had. And I'll just throw in, when you think about our 4 keys, we're constantly asking ourselves what do we invest in to make sure that we're offering the best balance to the customer based on what the customer wants and the retail environment that we're in. So Rodney's point about investing more in our people in the last few quarters is right on. Operator : The next question comes from Meredith Adler of Barclays. Meredith Adler : One question would just be, real quickly, you talked about where your guidance for inflation was for the year but did you comment on what you thought inflation was for the quarter? W. McMullen: We did not. But Mike... J. Schlotman: We're at the high end of that range, primarily driven by Pharmacy. It's about 1/8. If you look at it without Pharmacy, it would have been lower, and the comments we had on a volatile operating environment is -- if you just get rid of the headline news on inflation and you start to dig into the commodities, you have things going all over the world. And one of the things I think we're most proud of this quarter is there were so many things bouncing around, and our ability to manage through that this quarter really showed up in our results. Meredith Adler : Great. And then I was wondering if you would talk at all about the formats that you're testing called Ruler. I think you maybe have about 30 stores, and I was just wondering what your thoughts are. And we do know that Aldi is going to be opening more stores in Southern California is getting a big push, and Lidl is also going to be coming to the U.S. pretty soon, just how do you feel about that format? And do you want to be a competitor in that format? W. McMullen: We're still -- it's still very early and it's obviously a test for us. It's one of the things where we feel good about the progress the team made. The format actually came to us through one of our mergers. When we merged with Jay C, they had the format even back then, and the team has made a lot of changes to what's inside of it, and we continue to make changes. I wouldn't say that we're ready for prime time yet, but we are making progress in the right direction. And it really ties back to when you look at -- you've heard us over the years talk a lot about how customers are bifurcating, and we want to make sure that we have a format that serves all customers, and there's certain customers that living on a budget is really important because either they want to or they have to, and it's operating a store as efficient as you can to give the best prices you can. So it really ties to that. I don't know, Mike, anything you want to add to that? Michael Ellis : Just what we learned from this type of a format has really been helpful to better understand that value segment and how to operate in that value world. So we've really, as a company, learned a lot, I think. Meredith Adler : Great. And then just real quickly, I know you said your natural organic department was up double digits. Did you see any changes at all? I think there are some other retailers that have said there was a bit of a slowdown, I think primarily in the dry grocery side, but I don't know, it doesn't sound like you saw anything, but did you? W. McMullen: Nothing that I can put my finger on. It's still real healthy for us. Again, we have good supplies, so we haven't had any issues around that. But no, customers still are as interested in the natural category, the natural foods world, real food, we call it, as they ever have been. Operator : And next, we have a question from Andrew Wolf of BB&T Capital Markets. Andrew Wolf : I wanted to follow up on your thinking around the guidance. I think you said the quarter came in slightly above, with fuel, slightly below. So how does that, if we just isolate the stores, does that mean the stores was little better than that versus internal expectations? J. Schlotman: Yes, I think the strong IDs without fuel would demonstrate how happy we are with our core grocery performance, and our -- that's built into our expectations for the year when we raised ID sales guidance without fuel. So we're very pleased with what's going on inside the 4 walls of the store. Andrew Wolf : Okay. And Meredith asked about the, I guess, the cadence on natural, but I'd like to ask about it just on a -- across the store. It sounds like, from your answer and the answer on natural, that there hasn't been a big fall off or some volatility on the consumer side. I think it sounds to me like the worry is more on the supply side, whether it's the fuel margins coming in or what's going to happen with some of the commodities. J. Schlotman: Yes, I'm not sure I understood the last part of the question on the supply side, Andrew. Andrew Wolf : Well, first of all, I want to ask if you're seeing any change in your sales cadence, and is that where you're seeing volatility? Or is it just in the other things you mentioned such as fuel margins and potential disruptions or whatever you're thinking about with avian flu? W. McMullen: Yes, I'll answer part of it. I'll let Mike or Mike answer the other part. If you look at the change, during the quarter would be more driven by inflation, clearly is a little -- ended the quarter slower than it started out in the quarter. So the change has been more inflation-driven. Tonnage has been pretty consistent -- or was pretty consistent. If you look at this quarter, quarter-to-date, we would still be slightly ahead of the range that we gave for the balance of the year. And part of the reason for that is we expect inflation to continue to get lower as we go through the year. In terms of the avian flu and some of the other pieces, Mike or Mike? J. Schlotman: When we just -- Andy, when we sat back and looked at all the factors out there and the fact that even though it's -- even though on a calendar, we're almost halfway through the year, but for Kroger, we're only a quarter of the way through the year, we just thought it was very early to change our EPS guidance for the year given the volatility in a lot of commodities inside inflation, giving -- given what could be an unknown effect of the avian virus as we go throughout the year, volatility in fuel. Again, we're very happy with where we are and we think given the 8% to 11% growth rate off of a very strong last year, being able to deliver in that range and continue to produce the results on the cadence we projected we think will result in a very fine year. Operator : The next question is from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Kenneth Goldman : I'm not sure if you answered this yet. If you did, forgive me, but in terms of ID sales into 2Q, how are they progressing quarter-to-date, even if just on a qualitative basis? And are there any timing issues, any items we should be aware of as we model that near-term top line? W. McMullen: Ken, as I just mentioned, if you look at the identicals so far this quarter, we continue to be a little ahead of the range guidance we gave for the year. Part of that is driven because we believe inflation will continue to decline during the year, and we would still expect that based on what we're seeing today when you look at the impact on identicals. Kenneth Goldman : I did miss it when you just said it. I apologize. Broader question, we've seen quite a sudden market share shift in food retail in general away from sort of specialty channels back toward, for lack of a better term, the Krogers of the world, more traditional, I know you don't love that term, but more traditional grocers. I think the general thesis out there, which I agree with, is that much of the shift is generated by you and some peers adding natural and organic products, but it seems like better for you isn't quite big enough to move the needle as much as what we've seen. So are there any other drivers that you are seeing out there that would sort of explain this kind of quick shift in consumer behavior? Or is it just too vague and too hard to tell? J. Schlotman: Yes, I'm not sure. I guess, I'll speak for myself a little bit here. I'm not sure I 100% agree with your thesis. When you look at some of the specialty retailers, just because some of them have reported lower ID sales than what their trend has been, they continue to open stores. They have a little bit of cannibalization, and a lot of them continue to post ID sales above what the market would be growing at. So I wouldn't subscribe to the theory that there's necessarily a sudden shift in market share away from them. It may be a slower growth in market share gain, but I wouldn't say it's a shift away from them. We actually -- we can't ask our customers where did you shop before. When they -- when our IDs go up 5.1%, we believe we're taking share and more sales dollars from our customers from a wide variety of retailers and are happy to do that, and that's really what we focus on. But I think our sales strength comes from a broad base of folks, including doing a better job of offering new and unique products that they may not be able to get somewhere else, like Simple Truth. But I think -- I wouldn't -- if I were sitting in their chairs, I wouldn't necessarily be embarrassed by some of the recent results they've had. W. McMullen: And I will answer your question a little different than how Mike did. If you look at the Fresh side of our business, produce, meat and some of those departments, deli, we're having incredibly strong growth. Some of that is improving freshness. Some of it is that customers wanting to eat products that's fresher. And that is something that we have a huge competitive advantage versus a lot of our competitors because the variety that we offer, we offer it all, plus we do still have some -- there are certain products you just can't get an organic item or a natural item. So we're able to make your full shop with us. So it's really a position of strength for us and an opportunity for us to continue to deliver. Operator : And our next question is from Alvin Concepcion of Citi. Alvin Concepcion : There's been quite a few questions about competitive environment, but I'll tack on another one. Are you seeing anything different in the promotional environment as the quarter progressed, or even over the last month? Michael Ellis : Well, we probably have seen different competitive pockets of activity around the country, but that's not unusual. But as a company, we just tend to deal with that as things change and as our customers -- try to meet our customers' needs in the most beneficial way to them. But there's nothing really specific that I can put my finger on, but again, there is promotional activity. But when you have as broad a geography as we have, you see just about everything throughout the course of time. So yes, nothing I can really put my finger on. Alvin Concepcion : I guess, maybe more specifically, are you seeing anything different on the margin environment for your natural and organic food part of the portfolio? Michael Ellis : Nothing that I would say is worth reporting, but -- most of what we see today is just this mainstreaming of natural and organics continues, but I wouldn't say there's additional retail pressure on those categories, I guess. Alvin Concepcion : Great. And one more quick one for me, you talked a little bit about the growth in loyal households. Wondering if you could give us a sense of how fast that growth was and what kind of share of wallet you're getting now from those loyal customers? Michael Ellis : Well, we -- I can say we're pleased with transactions, and number of households and visits per household and spend per customer. So in general, it's very healthy for us right now. I really don't want to get too specific about any of the numbers, but overall, it's been a combination of those factors that have been driving our ID sales. Operator : The next question comes from Filippe Goossens of Mitsubishi. Filippe Goossens : Typically, you don't comment obviously on M&A activity, but I was wondering if you perhaps could opine a little bit on if there were to be a merger between Ahold and Delhaize, whether that would at all impact your competitive position in those markets where you do overlap with the 2 companies. W. McMullen: The -- you're correct when you say we don't comment on mergers. So I won't talk about the particular specifics on the one you asked about. But any time companies merge, it creates certain opportunities and you try to make sure that you deal with the opportunities that are created, and different ones create different kinds of opportunities. And it really is you sit down and say what is the right strategy for this particular one? So -- and we wouldn't look at, if the 2 of them merge, any different than whenever somebody else merges. And we believe there'll be continued consolidation in our industry and we have every intentions of being a consolidator in that consolidation of the industry. And as you know, we've participated in several mergers over the last year and the last several years. Filippe Goossens : Okay. And then if I perhaps may ask a derivative question. Obviously you've seen the news of CVS and Target working together right now for the operation of the pharmacy stores within the Target locations. I presume that Kroger remains fully committed to operating the respective pharmacy locations you have within your different formats yourselves going forward? W. McMullen: Well, we love the pharmacy business and the whole offer that it offers for the customer, and we continue to see strength -- strong results there. One of the things that if you look at the average volume per location and some of that, we would have very, very strong performance on a per location basis and continue to do very well and grow. So we're... Operator : And next we have a question from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : So Rodney kind of teed this up because you said you see yourself as a consolidator in the business and so I know, Mike, I think you said your leverage is 2.09. Thinking about your balance sheet, what is your capacity to do further transactions? J. Schlotman: Well, I think the answer to that question isn't what my financial capacity is, it's what's the capacity of the organization to do something, it's what assets might be available, and do they fit the metrics that we typically would go after when you would look at a transaction. So we wouldn't sit back and say, oh, Harris Teeter's behind us. We've delevered. Let's go spend another $2.5 billion, get it back up to 2.4 and work our way back down. It's really quite the opposite. It's one of the reasons we try to maintain the ratio where it is if an opportunity does come up, can we take on the leverage of that correct unique opportunity, act on it, have the rating agencies continue to have the believability in us doing what we say, and that is we told them 18 to 24 months we'd get our leverage back down. It took 12, and it went down again this year. And I think the statistics we went through with the return of capital to shareholders as well as what we've invested back in the business, all told, when you add that up, it's about $4.5 billion we either returned or invested. And to maintain debt at a flat level really demonstrates the power of the cash that we can generate as a company. Scott Mushkin : Okay. Second question is, and I know we touched on some of the natural and organic guys and other things just, but I was just kind of broadly looking at the space, you guys commented tonnage growth has accelerated. It seems to me that your market share gains are accelerating. Why, I guess? What's changing? Why is more market share accreting to Kroger at an accelerating rate? And is -- does your outlook -- forget gas and inflation, but just basically is the outlook over the next 12 to 24 months that this pattern is going to continue? W. McMullen: For us, the progress that we've made overall, we really would give our hats off to our associates. It's our associates interacting one-on-one every time and helping make the customers' experience a little bit better is what's driving the results, and it's our ability to support our associates to deliver great service. So it's -- I don't know that there's a big magic wand that we're waving. It really is 100 small things but doing each one of those things a little bit better and our associates continue to improve our execution and giving us feedback so we can keep getting better. And then using the insights we have working with 84.51\u00b0 and then now going forward, we'll be able to work with others broader than just 84.51\u00b0. So it's all of those things together that's supporting that. Scott Mushkin : Right. And if I could have one more. Publix continues to encroach. How do you stop that, and what do you think about that? W. McMullen: Well, we would say about Publix the way we would say about tons of competitors, Walmart, Costco and on and on and on. They're a great competitor. We always learn a lot from them because they do a great job running their stores, and we don't look at so much in terms of how do you stop a specific competitor. We're really focused on how do we make sure we keep getting better, and if they're successful in a market, they're successful at somebody else's expense, not us. Operator : And that question will come from Kelly Bania of BMO Capital Markets. Kelly Bania : I was just curious if you could talk a little bit about 84.51\u00b0. I thought it was interesting that you -- I think Rodney characterized it as a game changer, and I understand that you'll -- the new structure allows you to work with outside data service providers in conjunction with 84.51\u00b0, but just curious if you could talk a little bit more about what are some of the priorities in terms of how you would like to expand the use of that business for Kroger. W. McMullen: Yes, the -- how do I answer your question without our competitors understanding exactly what we're trying to do? The -- I can tell you I've had more dialogue, and several of us have, in terms of how do we better use the data we have for the benefit of our customers and to run our business better. And we've had more of those discussions in the last 8 weeks than we had in the 2 years before that because we spent an awful lot of time talking about things other than Kroger. So to us, there -- and as I mentioned in my prepared comments, there are a lot of great people at 84.51\u00b0 that we're just so excited for them to be part of our family, and I know they're so excited because they're going to be able to even help us accelerate what we're doing. So it's really hard to say specifics other than I can tell you we have a huge list of things that we can use our data for, for the benefit of our customers and running our business better that would, for whatever reason, we hadn't taken advantage of. And we're going to figure out a way to prioritize that and figure out a way to take advantage of that, and some of those cases will involve partnering with other companies other than just 84.51\u00b0. Kelly Bania : That's helpful, and any comments on what's the strategy? Or is there a strategy to grow the 84.51\u00b0 business with other retailers or clients like Kroger, so the company can grow its own profitability and growth? W. McMullen: Yes, we really won't comment on that at this point.   Before we end today's call, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. We recently wrapped up our Red, White and Barbecue celebration in stores across our company. Special thanks to each of you for making this exciting event possible, and I can tell you I personally ate way too much on the samples. Our customers loved kicking off the summer grilling season with fresh flavors and fun ideas to share with their family and friends. I also want to thank you for helping show Kroger's gratitude to our active duty troops and our nation's 23 million veterans this summer. Through our partnership with the USO and the Honoring Our Heroes campaign, we hope to raise an additional $2 million for our military men and women. Together, Kroger's associates and customers have raised more than $11.9 million since 2010 to support USO programs. This represents the largest gift to the USO in its history. Visit the Honoring our Heroes website for more information about how you can help. We also continue to hire our heroes. More than 29,000 veterans have joined our team since 2009, including more than 6,000 associates last year. Thank you for helping welcome them to our Kroger family. That completes our call today, and thanks for joining. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Cindy Holmes, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Cindy Holmes : Thank you, Laura. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our second quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] Please save the date for our 2015 investor conference, which we will hold at the New York Stock Exchange on October 27. Details will be coming soon, and we hope you can join us.  I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. W. McMullen: Thank you, Cindy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's second quarter 2015 results is Mike Schlotman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. And the next time you see Mike, please congratulate him on his well-deserved and well-earned promotion. We are pleased with our second quarter results. Our 5.3% identical supermarket sales growth, without fuel, allowed us to continue investing in our business and delivering on our aggressive growth plan. Strong fuel margins toward the end of the quarter allowed us to deliver results that exceeded our original expectations.  During the second quarter, we achieved our 47th consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales growth. We exceeded our goal to slightly expand FIFO operating margin, without fuel, on a rolling 4-quarter basis. We kept costs down, which, together with identical supermarket sales growth, allowed Kroger to leverage operating expenses at a rate of sales. And we continue to grow market share by improving our connection with customers, which fuels both our top and bottom lines and enables strategic Customer 1st investments. These consistently remarkable financial results are possible quarter after quarter because our business is built on the belief that serving customers is serving shareholders.  Based on the strength of our second quarter results, we are raising our net earnings per diluted share and identical supermarket sales growth guidance for the year. While customers continue to feel optimistic about the economy throughout the second quarter, they also continue to tell us they want to spend less. More and more, they want retailers to help them save money with sales and coupons. We are well positioned with our everyday low prices and our weekly sales and digital offers to solve this for our customers.  As you know, the food retail business is in a constant state of change. Part of what makes our Customer 1st Strategy so powerful is it provides Kroger a firm foundation from which to approach new opportunities in the right way to benefit our customers, associates and shareholders. While there are many examples where our business is rapidly evolving, I'd like to highlight 3 key areas of innovation and investment today : technology, food and people, and how the steps we are taking in each of these areas are broadening our competitive advantage for the future. We are actively expanding our use of technology in ways we believe will make a difference for customers and associates. This summer, we expanded our online ordering pilot in Cincinnati to 3 additional divisions. We are now offering our \"order online, pick up at the store\" solution in select Kroger stores in Louisville and Indianapolis and Fred Meyer stores in the Portland area. This is, of course, in addition to the Harris Teeter's successful Express Lane service.  When you think about digital opportunities, we do not limit our focus to e-commerce. Digital for Kroger includes a broad range of efforts to interact with customers in increasingly relevant and meaningful ways, whether online or through our mobile app. A key metric is our measure of digital and household engagement, and during the second quarter, we continued to gain household engagement at record numbers.  Our Kroger technology team continues to earn recognition for leading-edge initiatives to establish the Internet of Things in our stores. Earlier this summer, Kroger's electronic temperature monitoring project was named a winner of the CIO 100 Award by CIO Magazine. And as we shared with you in June, the talented team at 84.51\u00b0 is helping us grow and evolve even faster due to their closer daily involvement in our business. 84.51\u00b0's specialty, helping us make data-driven decisions that truly put the customer first, is a significant competitive advantage for Kroger.  Our multitiered Corporate Brands portfolio has always been a powerful differentiator for Kroger. Simple Truth continues to see explosive growth. Private Selection remains a vibrant, billion-dollar brand that is growing in the double digits and developing unique offerings in many categories.  I'm pleased to share with you that later this month, we will launch an entirely new brand called HemisFares. HemisFares brings only the best food finds from around the globe to our food-curious customers for an amazing authentic eating experience. It's a guided tour of the best tastes on the earth. Imagine landing in a country known for its incredible food and experiencing the finest examples of its region's most famous and delectable eats. Every HemisFares product is curated from the source and imported directly to our stores. The most exciting part is that no one else has a brand like this. HemisFares is a great example of what makes our Corporate Brands unique, and we think it will appeal to millennials, foodies and, ultimately, all cuffs of our customers. And by the way, I've tried a lot of the products, and it's outstanding. It's not just great. And I think you're going to love it when you get a chance to try it.  Our reputation for consistently -- consistent execution rests squarely on the shoulders of our 400,000 associates who make it all happen in our stores, distribution centers, manufacturing facilities and offices. Our workforce is expanding rapidly to support our growth strategy. Last year, we created 25,000 new jobs, and right now, we are hiring to fill an estimated 20,000 new and permanent positions in our stores. We are looking for people who want to be part of a team, take pride in everything they do and want to grow with us.  One important and untapped resource for new associates is our country's military veterans. Since 2009, more than 29,000 veterans have joined our ranks, and hundreds of current associates continue to actively serve in the military. Over the past several years, Kroger has formalized our military hiring initiatives. We joined the 100,000 Jobs Mission, a coalition of companies with the common goal of hiring transitioning service members and military veterans, and we have increased our presence at military recruiting events. Next week, we are hosting our first ever Honoring Our Heroes hiring event, during which we will hold open interviews at every one of our supermarket locations on Tuesday, September 15, for all veterans and their family members. The fact that nearly 70% of our store managers started out as hourly associates or stocking shelves or bagging groceries speaks to Kroger's opportunity culture, which, we believe, is a differentiator for us today and will continue to be so in the future.  Before I turn it over to Mike, I'd like to comment on our announcement yesterday of a new organizational structure for our senior leadership team. We take a team approach to leadership, and this new structure is designed to better align resources to our company's goals. It also streamlines decision-making and accelerates progress on our growth strategy. As I said in our announcement yesterday, Kroger is incredibly fortunate to have such an exceptional strong group of leaders across our company, and our senior leadership team has unmatched depth and experience to continue delivering for our customers, associates and shareholders.  Now Mike Schlotman will offer more detail on Kroger's second quarter results, provide you an update on labor relations and update our guidance for 2015. Mike? J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. First, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our results for the quarter in each of the key performance target areas for our long-term growth plan.  Our first metric is identical supermarket sales without fuel. Our identical supermarket sales growth of 5.3% in the second quarter demonstrates the strength of our core business. Our identical supermarket sales growth was driven by a combination of strong tonnage growth and an increase in the number of households shopping with us in the second quarter. We also met our goal to grow the number of loyal households at an even faster rate than total household growth during the quarter. All geographies and supermarket departments had positive identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, during the quarter. We continue to see outstanding double-digit identical sales growth in our natural foods department. Our meat, deli and pharmacy departments also posted strong sales. Rolling 4 quarters FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel, the 2014 and 2013 adjustment items and the contributions to the pension and foundation in the third and fourth quarters of 2014, I hope you got all that, increased by 20 basis points. This exceeded our commitment to grow the rate slightly over time on a rolling 4 quarters basis.  Return on invested capital on a rolling 4 quarters basis was 14.24%. We are not presenting a comparative number this quarter because the last year's second quarter calculation does not include a full year of Harris Teeter assets and results. We continue to expect our return on invested capital for fiscal 2015 to increase slightly from fiscal 2014 results. This is an important metric as we continue to increase our capital investment to drive our future growth. Before I share our second quarter results in more detail, I'd like to discuss how we are successfully managing through the current operating environment, which has more volatility than normal, especially as it relates to fuel margins and inflation. We benefited from higher fuel margins late in the second quarter. As Rodney said, our nonfuel results were right in line with where we expected them to be. We expect fuel volatility to continue for the remainder of the year.  Another factor that we are actively managing is product costs. While inflation continued at a lower rate during the second quarter, which we estimate was approximately 1.4% without fuel, some commodities had high inflation and others had deflation. Seafood and milk were deflationary, produce prices were less deflationary in the quarter, and we continue to see inflation in generic pharmaceuticals. It bears repeating that if you look back over the past several years, we have had periods of high and low inflation, and we've shown that regardless of the environment, we will deliver greater value and convenience for our customers.  Now I'll share our second quarter 2015 results in more detail. As you know, we don't provide guidance for total sales because of the unpredictable impact that fuel has on our overall results. Total sales in the second quarter were impacted by the lower retail price of fuel, much like the first quarter. The average price of retail fuel during our second quarter was $2.67 compared to $3.54 last year.  Total sales in the second quarter increased 0.9% to $25.5 billion compared to $25.3 billion in the same period last year. Excluding fuel, total sales increased 5.7% for the second quarter compared to the same period last year.  In the second quarter, our net earnings totaled $433 million or $0.44 per diluted share. Net earnings in the same period last year were $347 million or $0.35 per diluted share.  Kroger reported a $21 million LIFO charge during the quarter compared to a $26 million LIFO charge in the same quarter last year. FIFO gross margin, excluding retail fuel operations, decreased 7 basis points from the same period last year.  Strong identical supermarket sales growth and cost controls allowed Kroger to leverage operating expenses as a rate of sales in the second quarter. Total operating expenses, excluding retail fuel operations, decreased 35 basis points as a percent of sales compared to last year. Second quarter FIFO operating profit, excluding fuel, increased approximately $93 million over the prior year.  Now for retail fuel operations. In the second quarter, our cents-per-gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.19 compared to $0.183 in the same quarter last year. We expect fuel margins to continue to be volatile during the second half of the year.  Corporate Brands performance during the second quarter was solid, representing an approximately 26.4% of total units sold and 25.1% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy. I will provide a brief update on labor relations. We recently agreed to new contracts in Columbus and Memphis and have ratified all the local agreements associated with a master agreement with the Teamsters covering several distribution and manufacturing facilities. We are currently negotiating contracts with the UFCW store associates in Denver and Portland and with the Teamsters covering our Southern California distribution centers. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive cost and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and a retirement benefit for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions which represent many of our associates should have a shared objective : growing Kroger's business and profitability, which help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.  Our long-term financial strategy continues to be to repurchase shares, have an increasing dividend, fund increasing capital investments and to maintain our current investment-grade debt rating. Our strong financial position has allowed us to return $1 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends over the last 4 quarters. During the second quarter, Kroger repurchased 1.1 million common shares for a total investment of $43 million. Capital investments, excluding mergers and acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, totaled $812 million for the second quarter compared to $672 million for the same period last year. We expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to be at the high end of the $3 billion to $3.3 billion range for the year. We are turning towards the high end because we see a strong pipeline of high-quality projects, and we continue to be encouraged by the results from our new stores. In order to have a steady flow of projects and increase the total number of store projects, we are spending on stores scheduled to open in 2016 to make sure they are ready to meet our target dates. Additionally, we continue to reduce the amount of time it takes to complete projects.  The company's net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio decreased to 2.02 compared to 2.32 during the same period last year. Kroger's net total debt is $11.3 billion compared to $11.1 billion during the same period last year. Again this year -- or again this quarter, we have essentially maintained our absolute debt level while returning $1 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last 4 quarters, investing $3.1 billion in capital on a rolling 4 quarters basis, plus an additional $426 million on mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities. In other words, we are keeping our commitments to our bondholders and shareholders while delivering value to our customers and increasing opportunities for our associates.  Now I'd like to update our growth objectives for 2015. Based on our strong year-to-date performance, we raised our identical supermarket sales growth guidance, excluding fuel, to a range of 4% to 5% for 2015; the prior guidance was 3.5% to 4.5%. We also raised our net earnings per diluted share guidance to a range of $1.92 to $1.98 for fiscal 2015; the previous guidance was $1.90 to $1.95 per diluted share. This range exceeds the company's net earnings per diluted share growth rate guidance of 8% to 11%. Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend expected to increase over time. We continue to expect the third quarter to be at the high end of our long-term growth range and the fourth quarter to be below the range. Our second quarter results demonstrate that our base business is performing very well. The volatility of fuel in the back half of the year will determine where we end up within that range.  Now I'll return it back to Rodney. W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike. Kroger's business is strong. Our team of associates continues to drive our Customer 1st strategy by taking care of our customers in big and small ways, offering fresh foods and keeping costs down so that we can reinvest those savings in our associates, store experience, products and prices. As a result, we continue to earn customer loyalty and gain market share. We are investing to grow our business for the future while delivering on our promises today. Our stores are hiring to fill 20,000 new permanent jobs. We are expanding our digital and e-commerce offerings. Our confidence in Kroger has never been stronger.  Now we look forward to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Karen Short of Deutsche Bank. Karen Short : I just -- I don't want to sound negative here, but I guess, what I'm wondering, in terms of your ID guidance for the year, it definitely reflects a slow-down in the 2-year comp in the third quarter and fourth quarter, even though it looks like inflation is maybe getting a little bit better, maybe less of a headwind. So I guess, any color there. Is this you kind of being conservative? Any color you could give would be helpful. W. McMullen: Well, it's -- the guidance is always one of the hardest things to come up with what's the right estimate. As you know, we've always expected inflation to continue to slow down during the year, and we would expect that to continue. Now, we're working hard, as always, to make sure that we're at a good side of that. If you look at where we are so far this quarter, we continue to track within those -- within the guidance and kind of similar to where we were in the second quarter. So we feel good about where we are, but -- and we see exciting opportunities. I don't know, Mike, did you want to... J. Schlotman: Yes, Karen, another thing to keep in mind is if you look at real growth, if you look at our current ID sales trend, and even what we would be projecting, and take away the relatively benign inflationary environment today, it's actually as strong of a real growth as we've had in quite some time, really, going all the way back to 3 or 4 years, actually 4 or 5 years. You really don't see a trend as strong as we have today when you look at it on an inflation-adjusted basis. Our tonnage growth is quite strong. And from our standpoint, as long as we continue to have the tonnage growth in many of the departments that we have, we'll be just fine, because that's the ultimate demonstration of the strength of your business is how many items are the customers buying on a weekly and monthly basis. Karen Short : Okay, and that's helpful. And then, I guess, also just on your guidance, I'm -- just was wondering, on your updated pension guidance, you have some changes in both the company and the multiemployer. It's unclear to me on the multiemployer if your prior guidance just didn't include the $60 million that was previously accrued, but you definitely also increased the company-sponsored. So obviously, you're raising your guidance even with these -- those 2 headwinds? J. Schlotman: Yes. The $60 million would have been accrued and expensed when it was accrued. Keep in mind that on the multiemployer plans, when you have a contractual obligation or actually put dollars in, you expense it, versus a company plan, we could put money in, and it may not translate to an -- a current expense. So they're quite different in how you account for the 2 calculations. I don't -- it's not a dramatic change in our expectations between the 2 plans, although somewhat... Karen Short : More of a headwind? Okay, I'll get back in the queue. J. Schlotman: It would be -- I mean, it would be a slight headwind compared to where we were earlier in the year, but nothing dramatic. Operator : Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : So I wanted to touch on your pharmacy business. We've seen some of your competitors call out some headwinds within their pharmacy business on the margin line. I just want to get a sense of whether you guys are also seeing some headwinds within your pharmacy business as well on the margin line. W. McMullen: As you know, one of the things that's so important for us is our total portfolio of businesses. And when you look, there's almost -- every year, you'll have something stronger and something else weaker. And if you look at the pharmacy business, what we would be experiencing would be pretty similar to what some of our competitors would talk about. We continue to have very strong growth on the number of scripts filled, and that has been true for a long period of time, and our pharmacy teams continue to do a great job on taking care of our customers. But in terms of financial, you -- it would be very similar to what some of the others have talked about. But it is the nice thing and the great thing about having a portfolio of businesses where some pieces are obviously growing well in excess of the total. Rupesh Parikh : Okay, great. And then, switching topics to maybe expenses. So the leverage this quarter is much better than what we saw last quarter. Besides sales leverage, was there anything else that may have contributed to the better leverage this period? J. Schlotman: I think it's really across-the-board good cost controls in many facets of the business. As we often say here at Kroger, sales are a beautiful thing. And when you can have north of 5% IDs, the sale leverage -- sales leverage on the expense line becomes quite enormous. And particularly if your ID sales start to exceed where your own expectations were, it gets a little tough to add hours as fast as the sales start to come, and it takes a while to catch up to that. So there was -- there could have been a bit of that as well. But I wouldn't say there is any one particular area that would stand out. It's really pretty strong across-the-board cost controls for many locations. W. McMullen: One of the other things that we mentioned on the first quarter, we were pretty aggressive on incrementally investing hours in some places. Some of that, you begin to get the flow of it and you understand, where does it make sense and where doesn't it make sense as well. Operator : And next, we have a question from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : So, guys, 2 things. Do you think -- when you look at the momentum the business has and the things you have to invest in, have we gotten to a point where it's really hard to keep ex fuel EBIT margin to just up slightly, right, without making investments that you don't think have a return? Or you think -- do you think we're just in a period here where timing of investments had been slower, and that's partly why you're getting the 20 basis points? W. McMullen: I -- when you look at the business overall, I would still feel that slightly improving is where -- is the right thing, long term, for the business and what creates the most sustainable long-term value for the business, and obviously, then, flow through to our shareholders. It's never as easy to be exactly precise every quarter in terms of where you invest and how do the margins flow through. So I feel good about where we are, but I certainly don't believe, as I look forward, to cause us to do anything to adjust what we -- the guidance we've provided. I don't know, Mike, any additional insight? J. Schlotman: Yes, and one of the things to keep in mind, John, is we -- as you know, we have a portfolio of things we want to invest in over time. And these aren't promotional activities. To your point, we aren't going to go out and have crazy promotional activity that's not going to be sustainable and drive long-term growth. But we have a portfolio of things we want to continue to invest in. And frankly, some of the strength we're experiencing today is on the backs of some of the investments we made in the third and fourth quarter of last year. And you make a little bit of an investment, and then, several months later, you start to see the fruits of that investment. And that's one of the things that's leading to the strong IDs we've had in the first half. And we've tried to get into this rhythm where we're more diligent about when we invest, how we invest, balanced up against consistent results. And I think we're doing as good a job as we've ever done, and we still have that portfolio of areas where we would like to invest in. John Heinbockel : And then, Rodney, you talked about the organizational structure, which is quite different than you've had as far back as I can remember. And you said sort of right for this time. Maybe more specifically, what do you think this structure gives you benefit-wise? And then, it does sound like every -- a lot of the guys will have more direct reports than they did before. What do you have to do, if anything, different in how you run the business tactically to account for that, that people would be overseeing more than they had previously? W. McMullen: Well, a big part of that is just the growth that the team has had. I feel very comfortable that the growth they've had as leaders will allow them to have a little broader span of control than they've had before. As you know, we're incredibly fortunate to have such a great depth of people, and we're incredibly fortunate that they've been at Kroger for a long time. So they really know our business well and they understand what we're trying to get done. For me, it really does eliminate one layer of decision-making, and it really does streamline this -- our ability to make decisions. And the team is working together so well as a team, and I'm just really excited about -- going forward, I think it'll just make it a lot smoother in terms of how the -- how we operate on a day-to-day basis. Operator : And the next question is from Stephanie Chang of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Edward Kelly : It's actually Ed Kelly here asking a question for Stephanie. So I guess, my first question for you -- well, my one question... W. McMullen: Your one question. Very good. Edward Kelly : I have a follow-up. But so just related to IDs. I mean, your IDs are clearly exceeding expectations. You're raising the full-year guidance for the ID again this quarter. I would guess that the level of inflation is less than what you probably thought coming into the year. And Mike, you talked about it with tonnage, right, being the strongest that it's kind of been in some time. Could you just maybe help us understand how you're driving such strong growth in the business? And maybe even what's surprising you as you look at the top line performance today. W. McMullen: The -- it's a great question. And to me, the thing that is so important about what Kroger has been doing for a long period of time, not just in this quarter, is really focusing on multiple aspects of connecting with our customers and associates. So it's really -- we continue to improve the products that our customers have. We -- our merchandisers continue to find new ideas and new products. Our operators continue to improve execution and figuring out ways to take cost out of the business, and we continue to take that and invest in what the customers tell us is important. So it's really all of those things working together. The thing that you never know is how do -- how will competitors react to what you're doing and how -- customers continually change and how do you make sure that you're staying out in front of those changes. So far this year, we're incredibly delighted with how we've identified how the customer's evolving and changing and connecting with those customers in a deeper and deeper way. Our customers tell us, from the way that our associates serve them, the products we deliver, the prices, that we've continued to improve what we're doing, and it's really the combination of all those things working together. Edward Kelly : Maybe just a quick follow-up here on inflation. I think I heard you guys say that you continue to expect inflation to slow throughout the rest of the year. We have, I think, heard from one of your smaller competitors yesterday about particularly produce and maybe produce bottoming and getting better. So could you just maybe provide a little color on some of the categories and how you see that progressing throughout the rest of the year? J. Schlotman: Yes, Ed, as I said in my prepared comments, the produce picture, actually, the deflation slowed. And actually, if you were to look at the very end of the quarter, there was a slight bit of inflation in the last several weeks. Nothing to write home about, but it was deflationary for the quarter but got less, and actually turned a bit towards the end of the quarter. You continue to see other categories out there that have a mixed bag. Grocery is still, let's call it, just north of flat, just a little bit of inflation, and that's a big driving factor in it. The other one to keep out -- to keep in mind, as you think about inflation, is pharmacy is a big inflationary area that I spoke of as well. The generic costs continue to go up. It's -- on the earlier question on the headwinds from gross margin in pharmacy, it's one of the reasons why that headwind exists, because you can't pass that on as quickly as the cost of the underlying pills go up. So it continues to be a mixed bag. You're seeing some of the meat complex get less inflationary and, in fact, deflationary in some areas, but still some slight inflation in other areas. Seafood is a little deflationary right now, but it continues to be a little bit all over the board. Operator : The next question is from Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley. Vincent Sinisi : Wanted to ask on the digital initiatives. You guys had said that a few more divisions now have the pick-up-at-store capabilities. Can you give us a little bit more color as to what you're seeing in terms of traction, usage there? What may be in the basket, and then maybe kind of some thoughts going forward for further rollout? W. McMullen: Well, the -- I -- to give you some insights, the -- it's -- what we find is some customers enjoy shopping that and -- in addition to still buying stuff in the store. So it's -- and you've heard us talk a long time about, on digital, we really do believe it's an and, and not an or. And all it is, is trying to offer one more way of a customer engaging with us so that they get engaged with us the way they want to versus the way they have to. And what we find is the customer feedback has been very positive for some customers, but it's not all customers. And the learnings that we were able to get from Harris Teeter is they really were able to accelerate teaching us how to do it, and then, our store associates are doing a great job of executing against that. In terms of specifics on going forward, the only thing, really, I would say is it continues to be something that we test, and will kind of -- the pace of which we go will really be driven by how fast the customers engage with us. And one of the things that we're trying to do as a company is pace things based on our ability to execute against it and the customer's connection with it. So I wouldn't be able to give you specifics right now because we really don't have specifics yet. Vincent Sinisi : Okay. No, that is helpful. And maybe just as a follow-up, I'll stick with the digital initiatives. And I know you guys have said you're continuing to see some really nice growth in the loyal households. Have there been any changes on your end since the exclusivity with what was dunnhumby over the past couple of quarters has changed? Has there been any change in your approach to getting to know those loyal customers and who you -- who else maybe you are working with or not going forward? W. McMullen: The -- I wouldn't say there's been change. The thing that's probably the biggest difference is the leadership team at 84.51\u00b0 is involved in every meeting now. And it's things when you're trying to make a decision on what you do, the folks are around the table, and they have great insights, so you're really having those insights as part of the decision at the front end rather than at the back end of the conversation. So the biggest thing is just the quality. To say that we get additional insights, I wouldn't say there's additional insight so far. I would say there's a lot of additional projects that we're working on that should help us going forward. That, I feel very confident in, that it just makes it a lot easier to get those things done rather than having to negotiate with a third party. Operator : The next question is from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Kenneth Goldman : There's been so much change in Southern California amongst some of your larger peers. And I realize it's not easy, maybe it's impossible to quantify, but can you give us a sense for how much those changes have either benefited you or created a more challenging competitive environment? Just thinking about some of the issues that Haggen has had, some of the changes that Albertsons put into place. If you can address that at all, I'd be appreciative. W. McMullen: Yes, the -- it's one of those where, obviously, it's a good question but hard to answer. When you look at our business in total in Southern California, we're very happy with where we are. But the thing -- the biggest thing that we think is driving it is our associates are doing a great job, and our leadership team there, in terms of improving how we serve our customers. Now whether it's things customers do -- or our competitors are doing that causes our customers to like what we're doing better, that I don't know. I think it's always important to remember that in Southern California, Costco is actually one of our biggest competitors. Whole Foods would be a huge competitor there. You have a ton of really high-quality independents there. So the competition there is very diverse and more than just the Safeway and Albertsons and their merger and  Haggen. So I really -- it's hard to say a certain part is because of whatever somebody is doing. And we're really much more focused on how are the customers telling us we're delivering against what they're asking for. Mike, anything you would want to add to that? J. Schlotman: No, I agree. It's -- when there's any kind of disruption in a market, we look at it as an opportunity from a positive standpoint, not a woe-is-me, oh, what's going to happen, how are we going to deal with this. And when you -- when names change on banners, when people may go to market differently, the opportunity all exists that folks may look for a different place to shop that didn't do that in the past, and we want to make sure that Dawn [ph] and her team continue to do what they're doing to excite our customers and our associates in Southern California. Kenneth Goldman : And then, my follow-up, I just wanted to confirm that I heard correctly. You did say, I think, 3Q QTD ID sales, ex fuel, similar to what we saw in 2Q, right? [indiscernible] J. Schlotman: [indiscernible] What I said is quarter-to-date, it's pretty similar to where we are in quarter 2. Operator : And our next question is from William Kirk of RBC. William Kirk : So I had a question on Simple Truth. I think it's in some of your convenience stores now. I was just wondering how the brand's performing in that channel and how many C-stores it is in, I guess. W. McMullen: I'm looking... J. Schlotman: I've had C-stores for 2 days, and I already got it in there. Honestly, I don't know the answer to that question. How many it's in or how broad the... W. McMullen: Yes, on a few select items, it's in -- pretty broad in a lot of our convenience stores, but it's pretty narrow. It's early in the process, and we're really trying to learn how broad can the brand go and who all connects with it. As you know, historically, convenience stores isn't a place you go to for healthy offerings. And we are trying to make sure that the customer, if that's what they want, they can find what they want. So it's early in the process, but we are trying to learn how far the Simple Truth brand can go. William Kirk : Okay. And then, on, I guess, the M&A opportunity environment. We saw repurchases come down in the quarter, leverage is back to about where it was pre-Harris Teeter. How are you feeling about the M&A environment or opportunities in the -- out there? J. Schlotman: I would say our M&A appetite is the same as it's always been when the -- if the right opportunity comes along and it's the right set of stores, right sets of assets and right management team, we would think about it. There's not a lot that happens in the space that doesn't come across our desk. I wouldn't read anything into the share buyback coming down in the quarter to signal something on M&A activity. We were pretty upfront that we expected to front-end load our share repurchase program. And really, what you're seeing in the second quarter is the use of stock option proceeds and the tax benefit from that to repurchase shares to offset that dilution. And we're comfortable with our leverage where it is, and it allows us a lot of flexibility. And keep in mind, we are increasing capital, which consumes some cash as well. Operator : The next question is from Kelly Bania of BMO Capital Markets. Kelly Bania : I was curious if you could talk a little bit more about the HemisFares rollout. It sounds like that would be a premium quality, premium price point category. And just curious, in exactly which categories are you going to be launching that? How many stores? And really just stepping back and thinking about how does that come to fruition at Kroger? I mean, what's the idea process in terms of bringing that to market? Did -- was that born out of an 84.51\u00b0 kind of data science project? Or just any color on how that comes to market. W. McMullen: Well, the biggest thing it's -- it's really our Corporate Brands team would use the insights from 84.51\u00b0 plus other research they've done. We find customers are increasingly becoming foodies, and it's really trying to figure out how do you find great products that will satisfy that foodie need experience they want in a way that is actually a very affordable price. And if you look at the quality of this product, if you would go to a restaurant and eat food -- eat something of this quality, it would cost 4 or 5x as much as what it costs with us. So customers get to experience something that's very unique that's outstanding quality. And it's really the team searching across the world, finding items that are very, very unique and very regionally based. The initial items -- I actually don't know how broad it is. I can tell you, the ones I've tried would be more pasta- and sauce-based and olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette. Those types of items are the ones that I've tried. So the things I've tried are more based from Italy, but I'm sure there's others. It's just that's the ones I'm familiar with. J. Schlotman: Yes, the whole idea of HemisFares is to allow our customers to take a journey of food experience around the globe without having to leave home. And it'll be very specific on the packaging where the product's from. The folks at our Corporate Brands who've procured this actually have met with and visited with and helped with the folks who manufacture this product or produce the product on-site in their home country. And some of this product, it's the first time that anybody's gone through the trouble of importing the product with some of the items in it into the U.S. that we have. So they've done a phenomenal job with this, and we're really excited about yet another great offering for our customers in the stores. W. McMullen: We would expect it to be in almost all of our stores. We think most customers will want to engage with it. On some of the items, there is a limited amount of production, so it's not something that you can just go out and produce 2x as much if it sells 2x as much. Kelly Bania : That's very helpful. And then, just wanted to ask another question on deflation in some of the categories. I think you mentioned that all departments still comped positive, even though you had some deflation in dairy and produce and maybe seafood for the quarter. So just curious how you manage that. Do you do some incremental promotions in those categories in order to drive volume and increase the comps there when you experience deflation? Or how do you manage that so stably? W. McMullen: Well, a lot of times, it depends on what's driving the deflation. In some categories, you have deflation when the product is at its peak and tastes great. If you look at -- like produce. Usually, if there's deflation, that means there's tons of product available, and it's really great product, so you end up selling more. In other areas, when you have deflation, you're able to give such a great value for the customer for the item. So you end up promoting it more and the volume grows. So it's -- we would drive our promotions based on what our insights tell us that customers like and at what point they like versus trying to just make sure we have every department positive. But fortunately, every department was positive identicals. And I know, Mike, you were looking up some of the specific numbers. J. Schlotman: No, it's -- I was just looking to -- when you look across the departments, the strength of whether you look at the -- just the IDs or the inflation-adjusted ID sales, it's really pretty remarkable how broad-based the strength of that -- of the momentum is in various departments. I mean, we even -- we had some departments that, even on an inflation-adjusted basis, were still double-digit IDs sales inside their department, and I'm excluding fuel and pharmacy from that. So it's -- at the end of the day, it's really fundamental that -- I spoke of it earlier, why we're so cognizant of what volume we're driving from a unit basis because that's, at the end of the day, what drives your business. Operator : And next, we have a question from Robert Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Robert Ohmes : Just actually 2 kind of quick ones. Mike, I think you were alluding somewhat to the wage pressures. Can you kind of walk us through, is the wage pressures a lot more than normal for Kroger right now? And is that sort of a broader economic thing? And then, maybe tie into that some maybe more commentary on any changes you're seeing in your overall customer. HemisFares sounds like a more upscale, private-label launch. Are you seeing any change in the amount of trade-up going on? Or any changes in the different levels of your customers' behavior would be helpful. J. Schlotman: Yes, the comments I made earlier weren't directly related to any wage pressures. It was actually the -- our own decision, and Rodney mentioned it as well, of certain departments, where we invested some incremental hours in those departments to drive a better customer experience. And it also happens to be departments where some of our tonnage has been very strong as well. So those hours would have ultimately got -- been in the stores anyway, but it was in advance of that. The wage pressures, I would say, aren't really any different than what we spoke of in the first quarter. There continues to be some out there. We're cognizant of trying to deliver the right overall package to our associates from a solid wage, a good health care package and a retirement plan as well. And we're a little different than a lot of our competitors, where we're balancing all 3 of those for all of our associates. As it relates to HemisFares, I would put that in the category of the Private Selection and Simple Truth range, where it is more of an upscale product and a very high-quality product and it's -- but it does wind up having fairly broad appeal to a lot of folks. Because when you really step back and dissect a lot of customers, there are many customers who, on some items, are a budget shopper, on other items, they wind up splurging on particular items. And these can be the kinds of items those folks wind up splurging on, while in other departments, they're perfectly happy with an entry-level price point or a banner brand that's a lower price point for them. I would say that the HemisFares, as it develops, and Private Selection and Simple Truth, as that mix shifts towards those, it is actually one of the things that's helping to drive our mix to be a little bit different than it has been historically as well. W. McMullen: The thing that's hot so hard to tell -- I don't think it's so much economy-based as customers clearly want high-quality food. So if you look at the areas -- natural and organics, Boar's Head, Starbucks, sushi, all of those areas all have strong, nice growth. So I really -- it really appears to be much different than just economy-based. When you talk to customers, they are definitely interested in saving money. There's no doubt about that. Operator : And our next question comes from Alvin Concepcion of Citi. Alvin Concepcion : I'll keep this to one question. Just wondering if you could talk about changes in the competitive promotional environment for both the overall business and the natural and organic part of the portfolio. Are you seeing anything different as the second quarter progressed and even third quarter-to-date? W. McMullen: Yes, as you know, when we look at competition, we always assume that competition is going to get more aggressive going forward than it's been in the past. And we always find that if that doesn't happen, then life's easier. It's just the way we've, years ago, learned to do our business plan. We wouldn't see anything that would be major in changes. There's always a certain promotion or some -- you'll see things that different customers -- competitors do. And you'll see it, even within weeks, changing. So there wasn't anything that I would say is a huge change in the second quarter versus first quarter. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth of Jefferies. Mark Wiltamuth : Certainly had a nice bounce to the fuel margins here in recent months. If some of this persists, though, would you anticipate reinvesting that back into the business? Or do you think that would -- you'd let that flow through to the bottom line? W. McMullen: It's obviously a good question. It's one where I don't think I would really be able to answer at this point, because it really depends on what's going on in the marketplace and what do we think is the best use of that. So I -- at this point, I really wouldn't think it would be appropriate to answer it. Mark Wiltamuth : Okay. And then, just curious on your click-and-collect experience in those newer markets. Are the customers signing up for some of those longer-term fees like the monthly or annual fees? Or are they gravitating more to the pay-per-visit approach? W. McMullen: You actually have customers doing all 3. I would say, the most customers are on the 2 extremes. They do the yearly approach or the per-order approach. But it's not one of those things where you see 80% of the customers going one way or the other. Mark Wiltamuth : And can you tell if it's incremental in those new markets? W. McMullen: It's -- some of the basket would be incremental, but it's still so early that it's -- I -- the answer I gave you is what we're seeing, but I don't -- I wouldn't use a whole lot of basis off of it, because the sample size is still too small. J. Schlotman: Yes, it's a data point, not a trend. Operator : The next question comes from Andrew Wolf of BB&T Capital Markets. Andrew Wolf : Want to follow up on this volatility that you cited in the -- your product cost. First, on pharmacy inflation with generics, could you quantify or -- specifically or directionally how much that affected gross margin? J. Schlotman: Yes, I wouldn't talk about a direct effect on gross margin, but I will tell you that pharmacy inflation in the quarter continued to be above 9%. Andrew Wolf : Okay. And again, that wasn't passed through due to the contracts and so forth? J. Schlotman: Well, the -- you have contracts out there that you have to wait till you can pass it through. But also keep in mind, as generic inflation happens, we have the $4 30-day supply and $10 90-day supply, and we haven't changed those price points either. Andrew Wolf : Okay, that's helpful. And on -- when you talked about managing inflation and deflation, you had a good follow-up, I thought, on the pricing versus market share. So let me ask you about just on the inventory side. Does Kroger try to either go long -- commodities are inflating or be a little short those are -- that are deflating? Or is it -- when you talk about managing, is it much more about being sharp on pricing and managing it between -- using price to lever either market share or profitability? J. Schlotman: Yes, the -- we do, do some things for our -- for consumption in our own manufacturing plants when we look at supply of products and the supply chain that is out there. We don't go overboard on hedges, and we really don't use hedges so much. It would be cash purchase contracts to lock in a price for a period of time. But we typically don't get too excited about doing those things unless the current prices and projected prices are trending below a 5-year rolling average because it's -- if you talk to people in the oil industry today, oil is only going to do one thing, and that's go down. And when oil prices are going up and you talk to somebody in the oil industry, they're only going to do one thing, and that's go up forever. And I would say most people in the commodities world has -- have that view. So we're very careful about how we do it. The amount we consume is actually pretty large, so we try not to be -- I use the term a lot internally, I'd rather be approximately correct than precisely wrong. And if I made too big a bet one way or the other, I'd probably be precisely wrong. Andrew Wolf : Just a last thing, so that -- what you just described is only for the vertically integrated part of the business, manufacturing, it doesn't permeate to retail at all? Or does it? J. Schlotman: Yes, it -- so for example, I wouldn't go out, if I see something happening in produce, and try to hedge the apple crop this fall. Probably can't effectively do that anyway. But we do things with growers, trying to lock up fields and things like that, but that's more to make sure we have the exact product we want, not -- we do that regardless of the inflationary environment. Operator : And that last question will come from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. Brian Cullinane : This is actually Brian Cullinane on for Scott. Just wanted to talk broadly. Your business model is clearly unique and advantaged with the data technology that you guys have. Just wanted to touch on how you guys think about expanding and -- whether it's through square-footage growth and acquisitions or building more stores, getting your store and your offering to more consumers kind of in areas that you're not currently in. W. McMullen: Well, if you look in terms of going to territories that we are not in at all, as you know, historically, we've done that through mergers. And we're always, as Mike mentioned earlier, looking out for the right one to do something with. We're finding incredible opportunity on fill-ins, and we're -- the -- most of the incremental capital that Mike talked about is, what we're finding, is incremental project opportunities for great projects in existing markets. And right now, that's the highest focus. Now, that doesn't mean that we wouldn't go into a new territory de novo at some point. Brian Cullinane : Great. And any thoughts to -- you're spending more on capital, but to accelerate any of that with the success that you're having with some of the new stores and new projects? W. McMullen: Well, we feel like we already are, if you look at the incremental capital that we're spending, and we continue to push that. So you're always looking for opportunities to grow, but grow and make sure you execute, and we feel like we have started picking up that pace. J. Schlotman: Yes. I prefer an environment where I have a bunch of division presidents upset with me that they have great projects that we haven't been able to fund because of our capital -- what they would call capital constraints, and spending $3.3 billion this year doesn't sound real constrained to me. So if they weren't clamoring for more dollars, I'd be nervous about our opportunities. But as long as they're clamoring, I feel good about where we are. W. McMullen: Before we end today's call, I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge that this morning is the 14th anniversary of the attacks of September 11. I know that many on the call today were personally affected by those events. We continue to mourn those we lost on that horrific day and to honor their memory through our support for police, firefighters and other first responders as well as the military and their families. The 9/11 -- I recently had a chance to go to the 9/11 memorial and museum, and it's incredibly touching, and I'm sure most people on the call have. But if you haven't, it's well worth seeing, and it really does make you appreciate all the things that the police, firefighters and other first responders did on that morning. Finally, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. One of the most exciting things about working for a growing and expanding company is the additional opportunities it creates for associates. Many of you would agree that Kroger is a place where you can come for a job and stay for a career. When I ask associates and managers why they stayed, most tell me they fell in love with working with people, our customers and associates, or they found a deep passion for food. Often, it's both. As I mentioned earlier, nearly 70% of our store managers started as hourly associates. I believe there are many young people working for us today who will become our future leaders and will be having Mike's role and other senior leaders' roles and mine. Our associates are people who care, who want to connect with something bigger and make a difference in our communities every day. We ask candidates to imagine you at Kroger, because whether you're looking for a flexible part-time job or for a lasting and rewarding career, you can find it here. And we're looking for friendly, bright people who want opportunities to learn and grow. This is such an exciting time to be at Kroger. Together, we do make a difference. That completes our call for today. Thanks for joining. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Cindy Holmes, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Cindy Holmes : Thank you, Laura. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our third quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] I would like to thank you for attending our 2015 investor conference in October. We appreciated the opportunity to share with you our strategy and to give you a chance to hear from other members of our senior management team.  I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. W. McMullen: Thank you, Cindy, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's third quarter 2015 results is Mike Schlotman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  Hopefully, you saw our announcement earlier this week that Cindy Holmes has been promoted to Senior Director of Pension Investments. I wanted to take a moment to thank Cindy for her service in Investor Relations. Both Mike and I appreciate Cindy's efforts these past several years, which you know have been exciting and transformative years for Kroger. We know she will continue to contribute to Kroger's success in her new role.  I'd also like to introduce Kate Ward, who has been promoted to Director of Investor Relations. Kate joined Kroger in 2001 and has held a number of leadership roles in our audit and finance departments. We hope you'll join us in welcoming Kate to her new role. We often say that Kroger's success starts and ends with our more than 400,000 associates connecting with our customers every day. Our third quarter results are a terrific example of our team's ever deepening connection with customers. We achieved our 48th consecutive quarter, that is 12 consecutive years, of positive identical supermarket sales growth with very strong ID sales of 5.4%. We exceeded our goal to slightly expand FIFO operating margin without fuel on a rolling 4-quarter basis, and we continue to manage costs so that we can continue investing to grow our business for the future while delivering today. Based on Kroger's strong third quarter performance, we are raising our identical supermarket sales guidance and our net earnings per diluted share guidance for the year. During the third quarter, we contributed $80 million to the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan. This is the latest in a series of steps we've taken during the last 4 years to help stabilize pension benefits for our associates while continuing to deliver strong shareholder value. In January 2012, we agreed to establish the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan by working with the union to consolidate 4 multiemployer pension funds into one. This agreement protected pensions already earned and provided greater stability for future benefits of more than 65,000 Kroger associates. In June 2014, we announced similar agreements with 2 additional multiemployer pension funds. All of these steps reflect our strategic decision to increase certainty of pension benefits for our associates. These are examples of how we identify opportunity to use our financial flexibility.  We are very excited about our pending merger with Roundy's. We have filed our tender offer documents, and while we wait for the conclusion of that process and regulatory approval, I simply want to reiterate how much we are looking forward to welcoming Roundy's team to the Kroger family of stores.  The economy overall continues to slowly improve, and customers continue to feel more optimistic. But the bifurcation in the economy remains. Some customers are willing to spend more while others are worried about their job or next paycheck, are more focused on saving. We find that all customers want quality products and a great shopping experience. For the customer who's more focused on natural and organic products, we have our own Simple Truth brand. We also have many entry-level price point items of excellent quality. For customers looking for incredibly high-quality products like Boar's Head or Murray's Cheese, just to name a couple, we have that, too. Our job is to understand and deliver for our diverse set of customers so that they can save where they want to save and splurge where they want to splurge.  Finally, before I turn it over to Mike, I would like to note that there is an important global dialogue taking place that underscores the positive role businesses can play in sustainability. Kroger's team has been making progress to integrate sustainable practices into our everyday business operations. For example, our stores and manufacturing facilities have made significant progress by reducing the amount of waste sent to landfills. In 5 years, the number of stores recycling food waste has increased 73% from 290 to more than 1,000 this year. 30 of our 37 manufacturing plants are sending zero waste to landfills, an increase of 9 facilities since 2013. Taken together, along with a lot of other efforts, Kroger is sending 69% less waste to landfills than we used to, and we will continue to work toward zero waste. This is only possible due to the thousands of individual activities our associates are doing on a daily basis. Their efforts are helping make each community we serve a better place to live, and they have helped Kroger earn a spot on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the third consecutive year. More than 600 companies in North America are evaluated each year, and only the top 20% are listed on the index. This is obviously something we're very proud of. We look forward to sharing our new 5-year sustainability goals with an eye toward pushing even faster and having more accelerated progress in the near future. As you can see, we have a lot going on at Kroger. I am thrilled with our financial results and what we are doing for our associates, our customers, our communities and shareholders. Now Mike will offer more detail on Kroger's third quarter results, provide an update on labor relations and an update on our guidance for 2015. Mike? J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to echo Rodney's comments relative to Cindy and also welcome Kate to the team.  First, I'd like to spend a few minutes discussing our results for the quarter in each of the key performance target areas from our long-term growth plan. Our first metric is identical supermarket sales without fuel. As Rodney noted earlier, we are very pleased with our 5.4% identical supermarket sales growth in the third quarter. It reflects the underlying strength of our core business and our associates' growing connection with customers. Identical supermarket sales growth was driven by a combination of very strong tonnage growth plus an increase in both the number of households shopping with us and the number of visits per household in the third quarter. As you know, our goal is to grow the number of loyal households at a faster rate than the number of total households who shop with us. I'm happy to report that we continue to meet this goal quarter after quarter. All geographies and supermarket departments had positive identical supermarket sales excluding fuel during the quarter, with our deli and produce departments leading the way. We continue to see outstanding double-digit identical sales growth in our natural foods department.  Our second market -- our second metric is FIFO operating margin without fuel. Several items are included -- are excluded from our third quarter rolling 4 quarters calculations, specifically the 2014 and 2013 adjustment items, the contribution to The Kroger Co. Foundation in the third and fourth quarters of 2014 and the contribution to the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan in the fourth quarter of 2014 and third quarter of 2015. While items like this occur over time, we feel it is important to report how our operations are performing. On this basis and without fuel, FIFO operating margin increased 18 basis points in the third quarter.  Our operating margin has expanded more than our goal largely due to a combination of 2 factors : first, continued stronger-than-expected ID sales; second, the continued incremental investments we are making in our Customer 1st Strategy are being made in a sustainable way based on insights from 84.51\u00b0. This is not a new normal for operating margin expansion, but rather a demonstration of our diligence in how and when we invest. Return on invested capital on a rolling 4 quarters basis was 14.16%. We are not presenting the comparative number this quarter because of last year's third quarter calculation does not include a full year of Harris Teeter assets and results. We continue to expect return on invested capital for fiscal 2015 to increase from fiscal 2014. This is an important metric as we continue to increase our capital investment to drive our future growth.  Before I share our third quarter results in more detail, I'd like to discuss how we are successfully managing through the current inflationary environment. While inflation continued at a lower rate during the third quarter, which we estimate was approximately 1.1% without fuel, some commodities had high inflation and others had deflation. We saw deflation in produce, while meat, seafood, deli and milk were all -- I'm sorry, we saw inflation in produce, while meat, seafood, deli and milk were all deflationary. We continue to see inflation in pharmaceuticals.  Now I'll share our third quarter results in more detail. As you know, we don't provide guidance for total sales because of the unpredictable influence that fuel has on our overall results. Total sales in the third quarter were affected by the lower retail price of fuel, much like in the second and third quarters -- or first and second quarters. The average price of fuel during the third quarter was $2.30 compared to $3.22 last year. Total sales in the third quarter increased 0.4% to $25.1 billion compared to $25 billion in the same period last year. Excluding fuel, total sales increased 5.5% in the third quarter compared to the same period last year.  In the third quarter, our net earnings totaled $428 million or $0.43 per diluted share. Net earnings in the same period last year were $362 million or $0.36 per diluted share, including a $0.02 benefit due to certain tax items. Excluding this, Kroger's net adjusted earnings were $345 million or $0.35 per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2014. These numbers don't sum due to rounding.  Kroger recorded a $9 million LIFO charge during the third quarter compared to an $85 million LIFO charge in the same quarter last year. We have lowered our full year LIFO expectation to $75 million from $90 million previously. The FIFO gross margin, excluding retail fuel operations, decreased 4 basis points from the same period last year.  Strong identical supermarket sales growth and cost controls allowed Kroger to leverage core operating expenses as a rate of sales in the third quarter. Total operating expenses excluding retail fuel operations, a $25 million contribution to The Kroger Co. Foundation in the third quarter of 2014 and an $80 million contribution to the UFCW pension plan in the third quarter of '15 decreased 23 basis points as a percent of sales compared to last year. Third quarter FIFO profit excluding fuel and the adjustments I mentioned just a moment ago increased approximately $66 million over the prior year. Now for retail fuel operations. In the third quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.238 compared to $0.232 in the same quarter last year. Fuel results have been more difficult to predict than normal. We do not expect fuel margins to remain this -- we did not expect fuel margins to remain this high this late in the year. Our expectation for the fourth quarter is a moderation in margins. Volatility in weekly fuel costs remain high, and where those costs end up will influence our fourth quarter results.  Corporate Brands' performance during the third quarter was strong, representing approximately 27.7% of total units sold and 25.9% of sales dollars excluding fuel and pharmacy. Simple Truth continues to grow at an astonishing rate, setting a record high for total sales in the third quarter while continuing to establish all-time weekly sales records throughout the quarter. Our newest Brand, HemisFares, has been embraced by foodie customers so much so that we are currently working with our Sicilian gelato supplier to expand capacity while maintaining the best-in-the-world quality of the product.  I will provide a brief update on labor relations. We ratified contracts with the UFCW for store associates in Denver and with the Teamsters covering our Southern California distribution centers. We are currently negotiating a contract with the UFCW for store associates in Portland. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions which represent many of our associates should have a shared objective, growing Kroger's business and profitability, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. Kroger's long-term financial strategy is to use its financial flexibility to drive growth while also returning capital to shareholders. Maintaining its current investment-grade debt rating is the cornerstone of this, and it allows the company to use cash flow to take advantage of strategically and financially compelling opportunities and to continue its fill-in strategy, repurchase shares and fund the dividend, which is expected to increase over time. Our strong financial position has allowed us to return $1.1 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last 4 quarters. During the third quarter, Kroger repurchased approximately 853,000 common shares for a total investment of $31 million.  Capital investments excluding mergers, acquisitions and the purchases of leased facilities totaled $832 million for the third quarter compared to $681 million for the same period last year. We expect capital investments excluding mergers, acquisitions and the purchases of leased facilities to slightly exceed $3.3 billion for the year. We continue to see a strong pipeline of high-quality projects and are encouraged by the results from our new stores. In order to have a steady flow of projects and increase the total number of store projects, we are spending on stores scheduled to open in 2016 to make sure they are ready to meet our target dates. Additionally, we continue to reduce the amount of time it takes to complete projects. The company's net total debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio decreased to 1.99 compared to 2.27 during the same period last year. We expect our net total debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio to remain under 2.2 upon the close of our Roundy's merger transaction. Kroger's net total debt is $11.3 billion compared to $11.5 billion during the same period last year. As I mentioned last quarter, we have essentially maintained our absolute debt level while returning $1.1 billion to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends over the last 4 quarters, investing $3.2 billion in capital on a rolling 4 quarters basis, plus an additional $160 million on mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities. In other words, we are keeping our commitments to bondholders and shareholders while creating opportunities for our associates.  Now I'd like to update our growth objectives for the remainder of 2015. Based on our strong year-to-date performance, we raised our net earnings per diluted share guidance to a range of $2.02 to $2.04 for fiscal 2015. The previous guidance was $1.92 to $1.98 per share. This range exceeds the company's long-term net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 8% to 11%. Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend that's expected to increase over time. As with our third quarter results, the performance of fuel in the fourth quarter will determine where we end up in the range. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we expect identical supermarket sales growth excluding fuel of 4% to 4.5%. As we said in our press release this morning, that implies an annual guidance range of approximately 5% to 5.25%.  Now I will turn it back to Rodney. W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike. As you can see, Kroger delivered another spectacular quarter and marked our 12th consecutive year of positive quarterly identical sales -- supermarket sales growth. When you achieve such consistently remarkable results quarter after quarter, it's easy to take them for granted. In fact, we've spent the past few years investing in our unique and multifaceted business model, which we believe has been a key driver of our success. We continually strive to innovate for our customers while delivering on our commitments to you, our shareholders. At a time when so many other retailers are facing very difficult circumstances, Kroger continues to stand out from the pack, thanks to our incredible associates. Now we look forward to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. Our next question comes from Ed Kelly of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Judah Frommer : It's actually Judah on for Ed. And congrats to Cindy and Kate on the new roles. First, just wanted to ask about the Q4 comp guidance. Is that an indication of where you're running Q4 to date? Or is there just some conservatism built into that given that you're early on in a big quarter? W. McMullen: If you look at so far, and obviously, it's still very early in the quarter and we're cycling very strong numbers a year ago, we would be at the top end of the range that we provided. So it really isn't trying to be conservative. It's just reflecting the fact that we're cycling some incredibly strong numbers and inflation continues to get a little lower. The other thing that you never know is how is the weather going to flow. Obviously, snow is helpful for the business, and that, you really don't -- you can't predict at all. And then, as Mike just mentioned to me, this year, we will not have a Super Bowl in the fourth quarter. A year ago, we had Super Bowl in the fourth quarter. Judah Frommer : Okay, that makes sense. And then touching on the gross margin performance. I mean, you've lapped Harris Teeter fully now, and we still don't see a lot of investment in margin. I mean, maybe Mike referenced it in that you're doing good work with 84.51\u00b0. But is this kind of a new normal, like a less than 10 basis point investment in ex fuel gross margin? J. Schlotman: I'll hesitate to give what a normal is for an investment because we do continue to make investments in price in a variety of areas of our store. I'd say it's a reflection of prudence on how and when we make investments. Additionally, the mix. When you look at the strength of brands like Simple Truth, when you look at the strength of natural and organics, all of which have a little bit higher gross margin, that certainly plays into the overall mix of business. But if you were to look at gross margins by department, you'd probably have a little bit different view of exactly how and when we invest. But we will continue to invest not only in price but all 4 keys of our Customer 1st Strategy. W. McMullen: And we continue to have strong growth in our fresh departments, and most of the fresh departments have higher gross as well. Operator : And the next question will come from William Kirk of RBC. William Kirk : So you guys are very good at data analytics and targeted marketing. So I was wondering, what are you seeing in terms of available promotional dollars and how they're being allocated in store versus out of store? And I guess the question is kind of for the industry and more specifically, if it's any different for you at Kroger. W. McMullen: Well, obviously, we really don't know what's going on across the industry because we only know what's happening for us. What we've tried to do is to work with our CPG partners, and we really do view them as partners. And what we're trying to focus on is how to grow their business and grow our business both. And it's really trying to make sure that we effectively spend the money that they provide to us that we then, in turn, provide to our customers. So it's really taking that data and helping our CPG partners to most effectively spend their money. So all I can do is talk for what we're doing. I really don't know what's going on in the industry. Operator : And next, we have a question from Alvin Concepcion of Citi. Alvin Concepcion : Congratulations to Cindy and Kate on the new roles. I think most folks were pleased with the results and the outlook, and it seems like you might be taking a somewhat conservative approach because of things like fuel gross margin, inflation and weather. So wondering if you could run us through some of the puts and takes in the fourth quarter. And more specifically, what type of fuel gross margins are you baking in? J. Schlotman: Yes. When you look at the puts and takes, as Rodney said, weather is often difficult to predict. Last year, actually, was a pretty favorable weather event for us. Not only did we have the Super Bowl right at the end of the fourth quarter, we also had a fairly large snow event in the Midwest at the end of the fourth quarter, and both of those served to have some pretty strong sales that very last week of the quarter. As I said in my prepared comments, the ability to predict fuel margins this year has been more difficult than I can remember since we've been in the fuel business, which is really since 1983 when we merged with Dillon Companies. It's not just where weekly retails and supply and things like that wind up, it's really the day-to-day volatility of fuel on the open market because we don't have fuel contracts, we buy everything in the open market. And frankly, we're very -- we feel good -- we feel very good about where our core business is going, the day-to-day runnings inside of our store and the ability to predict that and the strength of our ID sales, as we noted with the guidance for the fourth quarter. Where we wind up in the $2.02 to $2.04 will be wholly predicated on where fuel margins wind up for the quarter. Alvin Concepcion : Great. And as a follow-up, what are you sort of expecting in pharmacy margins? And also, I don't know, it might be too early, but any color on 2016 puts and takes as well? W. McMullen: A couple. On pharmacy, it continues to be tough as it's been all year, and there's obviously a ton of change going on. And what we really remain focused on is making sure we're helping our customers. We have a great team of friendly and knowledgeable professionals that will help our customers get healthy quicker, and it eliminates one stop somewhere else. When you look at overall, we feel like we have a very strong business model, and it's also the nice thing about having such a diverse business, when you look at across all our lines, that we can make investments in pharmacy, but when you look at the total business, it continues to perform well. Relative to 2016 guidance, I'll say a couple of comments, Mike, and if you want to add anything, but we'll give the details in March. We have a meeting where we review our objectives with our board, and that -- obviously, we're not going to share things publicly until the board is in concert with what we're doing. A couple of comments just to remind everyone, and it really ties back to some of the things that Mike and I have already said. Fuel margins, we would expect to more normalize. And if you look at inflation, we would expect it to continue to be less. But when you look at overall, and this isn't just for '16, but our long-term objective remains to grow earnings per share by 8% to 11%, plus an increasing dividend. And that's the long-term objective. And then we'll give more detail in '16. Operator : The next question comes from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Erica Eiler : This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. Just following up on your inflation comment just now. Just curious if you have any specific expectations for Q4. And then specifically, next year, I mean, you mentioned you expect it to go lower. I mean, any thoughts with regards to how we should think about generic drug inflation for the upcoming year? J. Schlotman: Generics continue to have a good amount of inflation in them. We really don't see anything as we look into 2016 that would necessarily cause a moderation. Part of that was driven by prices had gotten so low, some folks got out of the manufacture of those products. With good old supply and demand and just basic economic forces, if underlying costs for those continue to be high, at some point, other folks will get back into the manufacture of that business and perhaps put pressure on that economic cycle. Relative to inflation for the fourth quarter, our view would be it would be in the range of where the third quarter was and in the low 1s. And as we look into next year, we would certainly expect full year inflation for next year probably to be comparable to where inflation is for this year. We don't see a lot out there in the overall supply chain that would cause this to be different. Erica Eiler : Okay, that's very helpful. And then just switching gears to your loyalty program offering. I mean, we've seen a number of the specialty grocers recently discuss plans for new loyalty programs with different propositions for consumers across each. Clearly, Kroger has had success with fuel points in recent years. I guess I'd just be curious, how often do you tweak the value proposition with your loyalty card offering? How important is the points part of the offering versus maybe some of the other components that your program offers? Any thoughts that you could share, that would be really helpful. W. McMullen: Well, we would look at our loyalty program as not tweaking. What we do is we continually use the insights to improve what our customers get, and it's based on how customers react. So it's constantly using what customers actually do to try to do a better offer for our customers on a personalized basis. And the examples you gave would just be small parts of what the overall loyalty offering is for a customer. And the key is -- for anybody doing it is how do you make it worth something the customer finds of value. Operator : And the next question comes from Karen Short of Deutsche Bank. Karen Short : Cindy, we'll miss you, and Kate, look forward to working with you. I just wanted to follow up -- go back to 2016 on a higher level. I guess, can you maybe elaborate a little bit more on the Medicare Part D component because I guess the color would be that the reimbursement rates could come down fairly meaningfully. And so that -- I realize that could be maybe a bigger headwind for you in 2016. Obviously, gas margins are a wild card. But then as I think about maybe tailwind for '16, Roundy's accretion could be a bit more of a tailwind than you've guided to, inflation is kind of neutral. Any more color you could give on any of those? J. Schlotman: We won't -- as Rodney said, we're not going to go too far down the path of talking about 2016. Clearly, the litany of things you laid out, it's almost as if you have a draft of our business plan board book that we're getting ready to finish up at the end of the month and send to our board about the topics we will discuss with them in January. All of those are on our radar screen. We're putting all of those into the mix as we decide what 2016 is going to look like with our board. As Rodney said, we're committed to the 8% to 11% as a long-term earnings per share growth target. And it just wouldn't behoove either he or I, if we want to be on the March call, to get out in front of our board with talking about '16 much more. Karen Short : Okay, that's fair. And I guess just looking at the O&A growth rate this quarter excluding rents and depreciation. I guess when I look at the last 3 quarters, it's been pretty consistent kind of in the 5.5% range, and I realize for next year, Roundy's is going to impact that number, but is that kind of -- do you think that's a fair run rate to look at on a more sustainable basis? J. Schlotman: The 5.5% -- I missed the first part of your comment. Karen Short : Well, it seems to be -- you've been kind of consistently in that 5.5-ish range for the first -- well, for the first 3 quarters of the year. So excluding what Roundy's might do to that number, is that kind of the right run rate to think about on a more sustainable basis? Because I know we've talked about there was some investments in services and things like that, that you were making because you knew it would drive sales. So I just kind of want an update on that. J. Schlotman: Yes. I actually haven't calculated exactly what our OG&A growth has been, and I don't know if you're taking out the onetime items from those if you look at our core business. Our rate to sales is -- or if you're doing it with or without fuel. Our ongoing -- if I look at it without fuel, it's actually under -- year-to-date, it's actually under a 5% increase, and that's including the pension contribution in there. We look at those service investments the same way we look at price investments. And we step back and we have a very defined plan and a very diligent plan of what we expect to do in departments and how we expect to make incremental investments in all 4 keys of the Customer 1st Strategy. And some of those are price, which become more obvious because of the gross margin calculation. Others of those are a little less obvious because when you look at things like service, they can get drastically covered up. The whole idea of adding service in some of these departments would be to grow sales, and that's how they wind up getting paid for. So when you -- overall, we would expect to continue to drive operating costs down and use that as part of the fuel for the engine to continue to invest. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Kenneth Goldman : Cindy and Kate, congratulations on your new roles. Two questions from me. One, a little bit of a follow-up on a question that was asked earlier. But a lot of the CPG companies, especially on the packaged food side, right, companies that really -- like Kraft, right, they're running that 3G playbook. They're talking very vociferous actually about how they're trying to get off that promo needle, get much more about baseline sales. I'm not talking about any particular vendor, but are you seeing any evidence that, that's actually taking place, where a lot of your larger food vendors are perhaps getting a little bit less aggressive with deal-backs? Or is it really not affecting anything yet from your view? W. McMullen: Well, I will answer your question that -- well, partially answer your question. What we find is -- CPG companies, there's -- we deal with a lot of different CPG companies, and any point in time, you'll have different companies with different strategies. And we have a team that will work with CPGs based on the strategy that they're playing. What we find is when CPGs raise prices when it's not economically driven, our Corporate Brands always picks up market share. And it's one of the values of having an incredibly strong corporate brand program, is that when there's something that doesn't make economic sense, the customer understands that. So we -- at any point in time, probably almost any comment you would make on a CPG, there's somebody out there running that playbook, and each one would have their own playbook. Operator : And the next question is from Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley. Vincent Sinisi : Wanted to ask about your -- you gave some helpful commentary around the macro environment and kind of the puts and takes of the consumer spending behaviors. And if we try to, in a sense, kind of reconcile that with your natural, organic, your Corporate Brands specifically, of course, continue to tick up, what are you seeing as you're looking at your loyalty data? Have there been any notable changes in terms of kind of categories or products that are going into the basket more or less? And I guess, in turn, are you changing the way you're maybe space allocating in any way that might be helpful to share with us? W. McMullen: Well, if you look at -- there's constantly changes going on in the basket, and it's not so much new. But if you look at the fresh departments, that's been a trend that's been ongoing for a long period of time and isn't slowing down at all. The things that you ticked off -- mentioned on natural and organics, that as well. If you look at space allocation, it's something that is really important to do on an ongoing basis. And one of the examples I always like to give is coffee. If you asked me 3 years ago or 4 years ago, what I thought was going to be the future of the coffee category, I wouldn't have been very positive. Today, because of innovation by Starbucks and Keurig Green Mountain, it's completely created a different type of growth in that category, and we're continually adding space on what's inside the store because the customers want it, and it's something that is driven by innovation. So the change in allocation is more driven by innovation than probably anything else and how the customers react to that innovation. Vincent Sinisi : Okay. All right, that's helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up, just on Roundy's, just checking, does it still look like the deal should be closing before the end of this calendar year? J. Schlotman: As Rodney said in our prepared comments, we filed our tender offer. And we filed with the regulators, and it's pending both of those coming to a closure. Operator : And next, we have a question from Robert Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Robert Ohmes : Two questions. One, just on the inflation, I thought the commentary about produce is inflationary and meat, seafood, deli, et cetera, deflationary. Mike, I think you've made comments in the past about there's good deflation and bad deflation. And so as you're looking into fourth quarter and then into the 2016 overall inflation being similar, can you maybe speak to the components, sort of how inflation is playing out right now, if you guys think that produce still inflationary, sort of the same dynamics? And then remind us if these are better dynamics than other ways to get to this sort of lower level of inflation. And then if you can maybe just weave in what you're seeing in the competitive environment right now. Is it same, worse, better? J. Schlotman: Sure. Relative to inflation, it's -- overall, it continues to be a mixed bag and particularly when you look at the fresh departments, like produce, like meat, like seafood. Produce, in particular, it generally bounces around a lot during the year. When you see dramatic inflation in produce, it's not a good selling season because it's been bad growing for whatever region it is that's there. Earlier in the year, when we saw a lot of dramatic deflation in produce, it was driven by 2 things. One, last year's first quarter was relatively strong inflation, and then this year, you had a good growing crop. So you're really back to a more normal kind of a crop for produce. And actually, if you look at on a 2-year basis, the first quarter last year and the first quarter of this year, combined, they were slightly inflationary. So it's a more of a normal. While the fourth quarter was inflationary, it was just slightly inflationary. Meat, obviously, has gotten a lot of headlines as having been so high for so long, high prices. Clearly, with what supply and demand do, high prices over time, people stop eating as much meat and -- whether it's beef or chicken or pork. That means supply picks up a little bit, and guess what, prices start to come down. And if you look at it on a -- if a 2-year stack on something like inflation makes any sense at all, we're still net higher than we were a couple of years ago but still well down from peaks of last year. So it's a mixed bag. We think things like that are going to persist into 2016. The wild card is always where -- exactly where is pharmaceutical inflation going to be, and it has been very, very high for really the last couple of years. Relative to the competitive environment, I don't think there's a time that Rodney and I have been doing these calls together that we haven't talked about this being a highly competitive industry. Barriers to entry are low. Our job is to go out every day with our more than 400,000 associates and deliver a better value proposition to our customers today than we did yesterday, and that's solely what we're focused on. Sure, we keep an eye on the competitive environment. There are a lot of people out there trying to sell what we sell, and our job is just to do it a little bit better every day and win that customer every day when they wake up and make sure they want to come to Kroger. Robert Ohmes : Great. And just a quick follow-up. Could you guys give us a click list update on those, I think it was 19 non-Harris Teeter stores and how that's progressing? W. McMullen: Yes. It's still something that -- we're still early in the test. We continue to roll it out for customers. Some customers like it a lot, and it's just one more reason to shop at Kroger. Operator : And our next question comes from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : So I just wanted to get back to something you mentioned on the gross margin, which was with the mix shifting. I wanted to get your perspective on kind of what inning we're in on that mix shift. I mean, obviously, you've got fast-growing categories like private label, been a few private label, you have the fresh categories. I do believe you guys are in the process of updating your prepared food area as well, which tends to have a lot better gross margins. So as we look out, and this is really not next year, it's really more of a 3-year outlook, it seems to me that this mix shift should remain and maybe even accelerate and be helpful. Am I off base on that? J. Schlotman: Scott, it's a phenomena that continues, and to say what inning we would be in on the changing needs and desires of the consumer would be -- would probably be shortsighted on my part and I would be absolutely wrong. We certainly do a lot of predictive analytics with data we see not just inside our stores but overall in the economy, trying to figure out where the consumer is going. It clearly does seem as though there's going to be persistence in the shift to a more healthy lifestyle and maybe out of some of the traditional center-of-the-store categories and into more fresh categories. But I would tell you there are plenty of center-of-the-store categories that now have natural and organic offerings in a can, whether it's our own Simple Truth brand with spaghetti sauces and salsas and things like that. If you go down the dog food aisle, the growth in the dog food aisle is in grain-free and natural kinds of dog food. So even our pets are jumping onto the bandwagon of leading a healthier lifestyle. Everybody's laughing at me in the room by the way. But it's something that our job is to make sure we're there to deliver what the customer wants when they want it. And we will certainly stay on track with it. In trying to predict where the customer is going, I don't think I'll get into that. But we're happy with our overall offering. We're happy with our continued growth and thrilled with the team we have working on not just the center of the store and keeping it a healthy and vibrant category but all the fresh departments around the perimeter of the store as well. W. McMullen: Scott, you've followed Kroger for a long time, and you know one of the things that we try to do is make sure we design our business model so it's successful regardless of the environment and try to really play to what's going on in the environment. And some of those examples, that's what's going on now, but customers change and we try to make sure that we stay nimble enough to be able to react to those changes. Scott Mushkin : Okay, perfect. And then I actually had a question, at the Analyst Day, you guys laid out a very compelling case about market share and how that drives returns over time and that one of the big growth drivers you see for Kroger is taking some markets that maybe are a little bit below where the ideal share is and driving them up. As I survey your business, one of those areas seems to be the Mid-Atlantic and Southeast that happen to be with Harris Teeter. How do we think about those areas geographically and what you can do to maybe get the market shares up over 20% to really drive some handsome returns? W. McMullen: The -- we -- other than at the Analyst Day, we did give specifics on one market. We won't make it a habit of giving specifics, so we really do look at across all of the opportunities. When we merged with Harris Teeter, one of the things we talked about was one of the reasons we were excited about merging with Harris Teeter is the opportunities that they had in several of the markets that you mentioned. We're equally or more excited today about that opportunity going forward as when we merged with Harris Teeter. So beyond that, I won't get into any more specifics on a market, other than, as we outlined, we see this as a long-term opportunity across a lot of markets. Scott Mushkin : So you would -- densing up would be -- would definitely help you guys in those markets. W. McMullen: Well, it would help us in most of our markets. J. Schlotman: Yes. As we've long said, the higher our market share, the higher our ROA in a particular market, and that's really the cornerstone to increasing the number of markets with that high correlation. Operator : And the next question will come from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. Steven Forbes : It's actually Steve on for John today. As it relates to the capital development program, is there a focus on speeding up the pace of investments here, I guess, to capitalize on some opportunities? Or should we still assume the $200 million of incremental spend annually looking out? J. Schlotman: Well, again, I won't get into what our guidance is for 2016. But we do continue to have a great pipeline of projects and are very encouraged by our early projects. We will continue to grow capital as we go into 2016 compared to 2015. The $200 million is a number that I would say, for the next several years, we would increase capital by at least that amount. Keep in mind, as I increase capital and I increase my base -- my store base and the number of stores, I also have to increase maintenance capital a little bit to keep those stores fresh over time. So it's not just an allocation -- a new allocation to new stores. I'm going to have to make sure I continue to take care of the base operations as well. W. McMullen: And part of the thing that Mike talked about on speeding up, it's really our real estate teams, our facility engineering teams, our division teams and our attorneys working together to take time out of the process on how long it takes us to get a store open. So it's really everybody working together, actually taking weeks out of construction time, which is causing some of the acceleration of capital investment. J. Schlotman: Right. Steven Forbes : And just a follow-up. As we try to figure out, right, the impact here of the development program, can you touch or remind us of, I guess, the normal comp maturation of a marketplace or the maturation of the store-level EBITDA margin? J. Schlotman: When you said the normal comp maturation, what do you mean? Steven Forbes : I guess, the store opens at an initial productivity of 70% or so. I mean, what is -- year 1 and year 2, right, there's going to be a benefit on the comp side. Do you see a pretty significant ramp both in comp and profitability on the store -- at the store level? Because year 1... J. Schlotman: Clearly, when you open a store, the first 6 to 12 months of that store opening, with all the preopening costs that get expensed on the day you open, it takes a while for that store to turn black on an EBITDA standpoint. It doesn't become a comp store until the fifth full quarter that it's open, the way we do IDs. So it's a while before they contribute to IDs. In some markets, as we dense up, you have the potential to have a little bit of sister store impact. So from a total sales standpoint, you're getting exactly what you want wanted. From an ID standpoint in a particular geography, you may have a little degradation in a particular geography from their ID sales as you dense up in a particular market. Now some of these markets, our market share is low enough where that won't be as big of a deal, but we continue to monitor that as well. Operator : And the next question is from Andrew Wolf of BB&T Capital Markets. Andrew Wolf : On the ID sales, I want to compare them to Q2 because it was kind of the same number both for the print and for the inflation. So I think I recall in Q2, you said it was very much volume-driven, and I'm not sure you said that here. I think I hear you talking a little bit more about mix. Should we take away from that, that, that number has a better mix element this quarter than last quarter? W. McMullen: It was heavily driven by volume again. Very strong. I just... J. Schlotman: Yes. In my prepared comments, I said it was a combination of very strong tonnage plus an increase in the number of households shopping with us and the number of visits per household during the time frame. So it's a combination of all of those. W. McMullen: But tonnage was very, very strong. J. Schlotman: Yes. Andrew Wolf : Okay, good to hear. So there's no real update on mix, it's sort of the bifurcated message continues. W. McMullen: It really is the same thing that continues to play out. But it -- now it's playing out on top of years where it played out, so it's growth on top of growth. Andrew Wolf : Two more follow-ups. On 84.51\u00b0, you've been asked about it and you pointed to it. Can you maybe call out some areas of the marketing where it really is helping? We're used to sort of unique promotions, but is it also in pricing? And I know Vinny asked about allocation, but could you give us a high level there as to where it's currently -- is it helping the business more than it has maybe as we're used to hearing about? And also, when you announced the split from dunnhumby you said you could probably work with some -- or excited to work with similar companies. Any update there would be helpful as well. W. McMullen: Yes. On working with other companies, that we wouldn't share at this point other than saying that we continue -- that's something that is part of what we're allowed to do now, and we work against that. On helping more than the past, one of the things -- even some of the examples that you gave, just by continuing to learn and continuing to be more integrated, we're making progress on top of where we were. So to me, the biggest improvement and change has been, in the meetings now, the 84.51\u00b0 team is part of the same meeting. So you're not having a discussion and deciding what to do and then going out -- going back and sitting down with 84.51\u00b0 to say, \"Okay, here's what we want you to do.\" It's actually everybody in the same meeting and their insights to say, \"Well, you're thinking about this, but it's probably better if you think about it this way.\" And it's really the professional insights and experiences that's helping us accelerate where we are versus necessarily just doing something new. J. Schlotman: And in the past, while we owned half of them, they would have not been always around the table initially because we did only own half of them and they had obligations outside the Kroger world as well. So we have time for -- you had another follow-up? Andrew Wolf : Yes. Just real quick on the $80 million pension contribution. I assume that was contemplated in your guidance, either for the quarter or for the year. I just wanted to double check that. J. Schlotman: It is contemplated in the guidance, in the $2.02 to $2.04 for the year. Those are things that, with some of the strong fuel margins, rather than that happening a little bit every so often, we've taken opportunity to put the money in when we have that tailwind. It gets the money into the fund, and they can start putting it to work faster than if we did it over time. Operator : And that last question will come from Kelly Bania of BMO Capital Markets. Kelly Bania : And I'll just reiterate the good luck to Cindy in the pensions. And I just wanted to ask a question about relative price gaps. I feel like everywhere I turn in the industry, someone's telling me just how aggressive you're being with price. Our studies show something similar, and your gross margin is just holding up remarkably well. You talked about the mix. But I guess I'm just wondering if you could talk about how you feel about your relative price gaps. Do you think you've maintained them, widened them? What do you think the plan for next year is? W. McMullen: Well, if you look at longer term, we've always assumed that markets will get more competitive, and that's been part of our business model really starting -- Dave caused us to start that years ago, and it's something that we just couldn't [indiscernible]. And we don't see that changing at all. The gap, I guess I would word it a different way. You're always trying to get better, but you're proud of where -- the progress you've made. And it's something that's very important for us to be able to make sure that we're giving our customers a better and better deal. Price is one element of that, but service is just as important, and we're focused as much on that in terms of fresher product and better service as well. And all of those things together is what we think creates a unique model for Kroger, and it's driving a lot of our success. Kelly Bania : Great, that's helpful. And then just a question on the pension contribution. It seems like -- I don't know if I'm thinking about this but -- the right way, but when you have these very strong gas margin environment that generates a little extra cash and earnings, you kind of offset that with these kind of onetime contributions. Is that the right way to think about that in terms of how you plan for these? And then just what is the status of the consolidated UFCW plan at this point? J. Schlotman: Well, the status of it, it's in great shape. Cindy will make sure it stays that way. We did joke internally that it was her going-away present from IR to the pension group, but that wasn't. We -- these funds will need money over time. The -- our enrollment in these plans continues to grow. Folks continue to earn benefits. We have a great investment strategy, but they do require funds over time. And while we would budget them in to be made at different points in time, as I said earlier, when we have the opportunity and a little bit of tailwind and a few extra dollars in the coffers, we feel it's prudent to go ahead and put that money into the fund, let the fund put that money to work as quickly as possible to generate the return and continue to have strong benefits for our associates. W. McMullen: Thanks, Kelly. Before we end today's call, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. As I said a few minutes ago, Kroger's consistent outstanding results are easy to take for granted. The fact is your hard work in our stores and facilities every day makes it all possible. Your commitment to our customers brings our Customer 1st Strategy to life. In large and small ways, each and every day, what you do makes these terrific results possible. The holiday season is such a special time of the year in our stores all over the country. You help millions of customers every day prepare for celebrations at their schools, offices, churches, homes and more. Thank you for your hard work to make the holidays brighter for each of them. You also make it a season of giving by working with Feeding America, the Salvation Army and other local community partners who help work with us to donate food and other items where they are needed most. Thank you, and thank you for being part of our big Kroger family. Merry Christmas, and happy holidays to you and your family.  That completes our call today. Thanks for joining. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Kate Ward, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kate Ward : Thank you, Laura. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our fourth quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. W. McMullen: Thanks, Kate, and welcome to Investor Relations. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's fourth quarter and fiscal 2015 results is Mike Schlotman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Let me just start by saying, wow, what a year. I'm delighted to report that Kroger executed on our growth plan and delivered on our financial performance commitments in 2015. We delivered our 49th consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales growth without fuel and our 11th consecutive year of market share growth. We met our goal to increase capital investment while improving return on invested capital. And excluding Roundy's, we exceeded our commitment to slightly expand FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel. Our 431,000 associates make it all happen. I am very proud of our team. By keeping our focus on serving one customer at a time, we continue to deliver for our customers and for our shareholders with remarkable consistency. I also want to welcome the Roundy's associates in Wisconsin and Chicago to the Kroger family. Our merger closed in December and integration is well underway. As we've gotten to know the people at Roundy's, it is clear they share our values and desire to make a difference for our customers. We continue to successfully expand the technologies that Harris Teeter and Vitacost.com brought to Kroger, which provide an even better shopping experience for our customers. We developed ClickList, our shop online, \"pick up at the store\" service based on what we learned from Harris Teeter's Express Lane. I'm pleased to share that we've expanded ClickList from 1 market to 7 markets. We continue to improve the offering, and our customers and associates both are providing very positive feedback. We are testing Vitacost.com's technology and ship-to-home infrastructure in Denver through a pilot in our King Soopers division. We're also testing a similar endless aisle experience in our new store format that we launched earlier this month in Gig Harbor, Washington.  We're very excited about this new community-focused grocery store concept called Main & Vine. Main & Vine mixes local, specialty and everyday products all at affordable prices. It reimagines the modern grocery shopping experience, placing in the middle of the store fresh produce and bulk items, along with an event center where shoppers can enjoy cooking demonstrations, food and beverage tastings and find a new recipe idea for dinner tonight. Customer feedback has been very positive.  2015 was a big year for our Corporate Brands portfolio, accounting for more than $20 billion of our total revenue. During the quarter, Corporate Brands represented approximately 29% of total units sold and 26.2% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and Pharmacy. Simple Truth continues to grow at an incredible rate, setting sales records quarter after quarter. The brand reached $1.5 billion in revenue for the year. And already in 2016, Simple Truth expanded to be a true lifestyle brand with the introduction of Simple Truth household, personal care and baby products. We expect 2016 to be an exciting year of continued innovation throughout our Corporate Brands portfolio.  Needless to say, there's a lot going on at Kroger. We are creating a seamless experience for our customers. Whether experimenting with new formats, driving digital engagement or launching new corporate brand products, we believe that combining Kroger's culture of innovation with our culture of opportunity will continue to support our growth. Kroger has an incredibly strong management team and a deep bench of leaders throughout our business. We are incrementally investing in leadership development and training for all our associates, including high-volume store managers and future senior leaders. And we have created 9,000 new jobs last year at all levels, which means even more opportunities for current associates to grow and advance. For example, we established a new operating division, the Dallas division, which created dozens of new leadership opportunities. Looking at the economy and customer shopping behavior during 2015, we noticed that customer sentiment held relatively stable throughout the year versus previous years in which their attitudes were more volatile. The past few months, we've seen the top economic concerns shift from rising health care cost to the stock market. Customers have more disposable income as a result of significantly lower fuel prices. Yet economic uncertainty remains, which typically causes people to cut back on discretionary spending.  That said, an interesting insight is that our customers continue to spend with us. If you look at some of our high-quality offerings such as Murray's Cheese, Private Selection, Starbucks and Boar's Head or at the strength of our wine and craft beer business, it is clear that customers across all demographics want a great food experience. Because Kroger is doing a better job offering high-quality food at affordable prices, we continue to win with our customers even as they remain cautious about their overall spending.  2015 was an outstanding year for Kroger. We delivered on our performance targets and continue to expand our use of technology to drive growth. In 2016, we will continue making a difference for our customers and associates, growing our business and delivering value for shareholders. Now Mike will offer more detail on Kroger's financial results and outline our guidance for 2016. Mike? J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. As Rodney said, wow, what a year. We exceeded all 4 of our financial performance commitments for the year. Identical supermarket sales and net earnings per diluted share growth, FIFO operating profit margin and return on invested capital were all better than our annual and long-term guidance. Market share growth continued, improving by 40 basis points, with 17 of 20 markets outlined by Nielsen POS plus data up and just one market down. We had a lot of unique items in last year's fourth quarter, which make comparisons more complicated, so I'd like to spend the next few minutes discussing the story behind the numbers for our fourth quarter and fiscal year and to give you some color on those and the current operating environment.  There's a lot of speculation about inflation or deflation or disinflation. We believe a deeper dive is required when the operating environment has increased volatility. When you look at identical supermarket sales, you should not come to the conclusion that less inflation is fundamentally a bad thing. In fact, if you look at our real growth in the fourth quarter, that is, identical supermarket sales less inflation, this year's fourth quarter result was stronger than last year's fourth quarter when identical sales were over 6%. Tonnage stayed strong at over 3% unit growth during the quarter, and the strong tonnage allowed us to grow FIFO gross profit dollars, excluding fuel and Roundy's, by 4.4% in the quarter. All but one supermarket department had positive identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel during the quarter. Our natural foods, deli and produce departments led the way. The meat department was slightly negative due to 5% deflation in the category. This deflation has allowed retail prices to retreat or increase their purchases. As a result of strong tonnage, the meat department had a great quarter with strong FIFO gross profit dollar growth. This is what we often refer to as good deflation. Our operating costs as a rate of sales were down for the 11th consecutive year. However, they were up 23 basis points in the fourth quarter. This calculation excludes retail fuel operations and Roundy's and excludes a $60 million contribution to the Kroger Co. Foundation and $55 million contribution to the UFCW pension plan in last year's fourth quarter and a $30 million contribution to that same plan in this year's fourth quarter.  There were several expenses in the quarter that won't continue at the same rate in future quarters, including chargebacks related to the transition of our payment systems to EMV that we expect to level out throughout 2016. We also saw higher pension costs and health care costs due to an increase in the number of claims and higher health care cost claims. That occurred during the fourth quarter. All that said, we can and will do a better job in some expense categories, including shrink, completing our EMV rollout and benefit costs.  In December, we said that volatility in weekly fuel costs would influence our fourth quarter results. That was true for the fourth quarter as our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.169 compared to $0.234 in the same quarter last year. Fuel in the fourth quarter only contributed about half as much net earnings per diluted share as compared to last year's fourth quarter. For the full year, the cents per gallon fuel margin was roughly $0.174 compared to $0.19 last year. Our fourth quarter net earnings per diluted share increased 9.6% to $0.57 compared to $0.52 during the same period last year. This result was helped by the lower tax rate and lower LIFO expense, but our strong real growth contributed to our results. Our 2015 cash flow generation was strong, allowing us to make $3.3 billion in capital investments during the year, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities. We repurchased $703 million of stock and returned $385 million to shareholders through our dividend. Net operating working capital declined $451 million, which also enhanced cash flow. Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio came in at 2.08x compared to 2.14 during the same period last year, even while investing approximately $870 million in our merger with Roundy's late in the year. Our balance sheet is as strong as ever. I'll provide a brief update on labor relations. In 2016, we will negotiate agreements with UFCW for store associates in Houston, Indianapolis, Little Rock, Nashville, Portland, Southern California and Fry's in Arizona. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, have a shared objective : Growing Kroger's business and growing it profitably, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.  Turning now to our 2016 guidance. We expect identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of approximately 2.5% to 3.5% for 2016, reflecting the lower inflationary environment. For full year net earnings, we expect 2016 to range from $2.19 to $2.28 per diluted share. Where we fall within the range will be primarily driven by the actual fuel margins. We expect margins will be at or slightly below the 5-year average with continued volatility. We expect our core business in 2016 to grow in line with its long-term net earnings per share growth rate of 8% to 11%. Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend which is expected to increase over time. In thinking about the cadence of our quarterly results compared to our long-term 8% to 11% guidance, the first quarter, we would expect to be at the midpoint to high end; the second quarter, below that range, and keep in mind, 2015 grew 26% for earnings per share last year; the third quarter, at the midpoint; and the fourth quarter at the midpoint. We expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities to be in the $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion range for 2016. We expect Kroger's full year FIFO operating margin in 2016, excluding fuel, to expand slightly compared to 2015 results. Now I will turn it back to Rodney W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike. 2015 was an outstanding year. We delivered on our performance targets, grew market share, created 9,000 new jobs and even more opportunities for our associates, and we continue to expand the use of our technology to drive growth. We look forward to continuing that momentum in 2016. Obviously, lower inflation will be a headwind to sales, but when you look at -- back over the past several years, we've had periods of high and low inflation, and we've shown that regardless of the environment, we consistently do our job to manage through it and maintain relative pricing. In doing so, we'll continue to deliver greater value for our customers and for our shareholders. Now we look forward to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : So I just want to dive into the kind of the near-term outlook. And Mike, I think you said the tonnage was just fantastic during the quarter and actually better than last year's fourth quarter. Sequentially, did you see tonnage slow? And then as you look at the cadence in the quarter, it does seem like things fell off a little bit as we got to the last 4 weeks of the quarter. And any thoughts there on kind of what the current environment is? I mean, there's a lot of nervousness out there that the deflation is really starting to bite and maybe the consumer and the volumes aren't quite as good. J. Schlotman: Our volume continues to hold up very well, Scott. When you look at -- even coming into this year, when you look at shipments, case shipments, out of our warehouses to replenish our stores, it remains very, very strong. When -- if you go back to the commentary I had on the meat department, some of the categories, as we say, it's good deflation because we're getting back to retail price points where the customers can buy a lot more of our product. And while for the time being, it's a slight headwind to sales when you just look at the top line, with the number of units we're selling at a good gross profit dollar rate per item, we're generating significantly more gross profit dollars. When you look at the fourth quarter overall, you have to keep in mind a few things about your commentary about late in the quarter. We had significant snow events during last year's fourth quarter as well as the Super Bowl shifting from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. And those on top of a department, like meat with the deflation, certainly play a factor in what the sales percentage growth is, but the unit growth continues to be very strong. Scott Mushkin : Okay, that's perfect. And so you didn't really notice any material change. But you did come in a little bit below your guidance, I think, on the comp. And I guess, what -- in your mind, what changed a little bit there? Or maybe nothing did. It just was a little bit more severe than anticipated? J. Schlotman: I think the biggest change was that we had almost no weather at all in the quarter. Inflation ended up being a little bit lower than what we expected, but I think that by far, the biggest part would be the weather. And basically, we had no benefit of weather in the fourth quarter, and most of that would have obviously shown up in -- later in the quarter. Scott Mushkin : So then, Rodney, this is then I'll yield as one kind of just more longer-term type of question. I mean, the industry fundamentals just generally, things seem to be changing rapidly. I know you guys expanded your ClickList, but you have a lot of, like, I call them, alternate business models kind of springing up, whether it's Green Bean in the Midwest, which is delivering to the home, or something like a Blue Apron. Obviously, the idea of click-and-collect or AmazonFresh delivering. Where do you see the industry going? And how do you see Kroger navigating that more long term? And then I'll yield. W. McMullen: Thanks, Scott. When you look at long-term, and if you look at several of the changes we've made over the last couple of years, it is really merging with people that have expertise in some of those areas so that we could bring that within Kroger. And what we're really working hard on, and I mentioned it in my comments, is trying to create it where it's a seamless experience for our customer. By no means do I think we've arrived, but what we're finding is some customers like to engage with us multiple ways, and we're really striving to make sure that we have a model where we can let the customer decide how they want to engage with us versus us deciding that. So it's an exciting time to be in the industry. There's no doubt there's a lot of change going on. And the changes that we've been making over the last couple of years, we feel really good about positioning us to address where the customer is headed versus where they've been. Operator : The next question will come from Karen Short of Deutsche Bank. Apologies. We have a question from Ed Kelly of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse instead. Edward Kelly : So a question for you. I just wanted to follow up on Scott's question on inflation. I guess, Mike, first of all, do you have the inflation number for this quarter? I don't know if you gave that or not. J. Schlotman: Yes. Just give me one second or whatever. It's about 60 basis points overall, but there's a lot of variability in that number. As I said in my prepared comments, the meat department was deflationary, deli was deflationary, seafood was deflationary, grocery was a little bit inflationary. So it's a mixed bag overall. And as Rodney said, if you look at produce, it was actually inflationary. So produce has been all over the map this year, deflationary in the first 2 quarters, about flat in the third quarter, now inflationary. And our job is to operate the best we can given the environment we're operating in. And I think we've done a phenomenal job of managing our way through some of the volatility in the commodities that are out there. And in the backdrop of that, pharmacy continues to have inflation, although it declined throughout the year. And at the fourth quarter, at just under 5% inflation, and it started the year at 10%. So it's a wide range of things that have happened throughout the year on the inflationary front. Edward Kelly : The question I really wanted to ask about this is if I look into your guidance for next year, 2.5% to 3.5% IDs. Inflation, I think, in the 8-K you said, up 1% to 2%, which is not that different, I guess, than what 2015 is going to average out at. And you do have some difficult tonnage comparisons. You had such a great year in '15. So I guess, as we try to dissect this, is the difficult comparison in tonnage also playing a role in terms of how you're thinking about '16? And maybe as part of all that, you can sort of help us maybe understand why tonnage accelerated the way that it did last year? W. McMullen: Well, a couple of things. First of all, remember when we merge with somebody, we immediately include that company in our identicals. And I know there's other companies out there that don't include merged companies for the first year. And when you look at that effect, that will change the guidance by about 40 basis -- 40 to 50 basis points on identicals in terms of what our expectations are. The other thing is, and that's -- and you never know until after the fact is, how does the inflation happen. And we believe that early in the year, we won't see much inflation. We believe later in the year, we'll see a little bit more inflation versus being consistent throughout the year. And the inflation guidance is as much affecting the LIFO estimate as it is what we really think inflation's going to be if you volume-weighted it throughout the year. There's no doubt that when you cycle good numbers, the cycling is a little bit tougher. But it would be more driven by the inflation that we expect during the year and the mergers. I don't know, Mike. Anything you want to add to that? J. Schlotman: No, I absolutely agree with you. And you go back into some of the fresh departments, like produce. Produce inflation of almost 6% in the fourth quarter is not a good thing. That means there was probably a short supply of product and the product that was there was not that high of quality. So you really -- you can't just -- one of the things we've been trying to encourage people to do is, don't look at my 60 basis points of inflation. Try to dig down on the different components of it to understand how that can affect our business. Edward Kelly : Okay. And let me just squeeze in one more, because I think it's an important one, and this is for you, Rodney. Could you maybe talk about how your M&A strategy is evolving? If I think about -- your company over the last few years, obviously you've been more aggressive than you were prior. You did Roundy's, which I think is something that years ago, at least from a Street perspective, we would have thought was something that maybe you wouldn't want to do, a turnaround into new market. But maybe just talk a little bit about how things are evolving and going forward, really sort of what you're looking for as opportunity? W. McMullen: It's really wouldn't -- if you think about the comments that we make on merger opportunities over the last 5 or 10 years, everybody should assume that we look at most opportunities, especially if it's in the U.S. We're really looking for companies that bring something to us that we don't have today. One of the things that we loved about merging with Roundy's was, as you -- as everybody knows, that we were looking at going into a new market. By merging with Roundy's, it allowed us to go into Chicago with a business that -- Mariano's had done a phenomenal job -- has done a phenomenal job on connecting with customers, and their market share is in the low teens. And they entered that market in 2010. So we felt like we could learn a lot, plus we started out a position of strength because of the success they've had. When you look at Wisconsin, Pick 'n Save and Copps has great market share across the state. We love Wisconsin. We -- it's a market that we really like, and we look forward to operating in it. So it's really our partnership and synergies that we felt like we could bring to Roundy's and the strength that they have that we could improve from where everything was. So it's a little different than a completely typical thing, how we've merged it with somebody. But I wouldn't -- I don't think you should read into that, that our strategies have just fundamentally changed in terms of the way we approach things. J. Schlotman: The other thing about Roundy's, particularly in Wisconsin, as Rodney said, not only did they have the very strong market share even though it's declined, the real estate sites they have were phenomenal. And we probably would not have considered a transaction like this if they didn't have outstanding real estate sites where we know we can grow their market share back to where it once was. W. McMullen: Yes. And that's a good point, Mike. There is no doubt if we didn't feel great about the real estate, we would not have embarked on merging with Roundy's. Operator : And our next question comes from Karen Short of Deutsche Bank. Karen Short : CapEx for '16 seems way higher than I would have expected. Can you give any color there? And I guess I was also wondering if you can give some puts and takes on how Roundy's might impact your comps for '16 in terms of guidance? J. Schlotman: Yes, relative to the CapEx, as you know, we talked about our fill-in market strategy back in October of 2012, and we had expected a steady step-up in the CapEx. The guidance at that point in time didn't contemplate a merger with Harris Teeter and then a subsequent merger with Roundy's. Harris Teeter had gone into a new market in the Washington DC, Baltimore area. We continue to fill in those markets with some very attractive sites. Another chunk of the increase in the CapEx is allocating capital to Roundy's, not only to support the plan they had in place, there were a lot of plans they would have had that, given their financial position, they couldn't have executed on. So there are dollars in there for us to go in and refresh and remodel some of their stores to show the folks in Wisconsin what they can expect going forward. The rest of it is really, we didn't start off as quickly on our fill-in strategies as we would've thought in 2012. It took us a little longer to get projects lined up, and we feel comfortable now that the pipeline of projects we have are starting to come to fruition. And the other thing that's in there for Roundy's is probably a little bit of capital for conversions and the like on systems and so forth. W. McMullen: And on the identical piece, I mentioned that mergers in total, if you look at our guidance we gave, you should assume about 40 to 50 basis points is the impact from the mergers that we've done. Karen Short : And sorry, what -- last follow-up. In terms of CapEx, is $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion the new base that we should use and kind of grow a couple of hundred million off of that every year going forward? And then can you just give some update on what the Pharmacy impact is on the comps in '16? J. Schlotman: As far as the $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion, we will continue to increase our CapEx, and execute our fill-in strategy so long as we're seeing the performance on the stores we're opening achieve the budgeted expectation so that they become the fuel for the engine. And from a granular standpoint, I don't think I'll get into department-by-department expectations for ID sales. Operator : And our next question comes from Meredith Adler of Barclays. Meredith Adler : I wanted to talk a little bit about some of the experiments and formats that you're doing. I mean, obviously, you're looking at how to connect more broadly digitally with your customers. But I think, and maybe I missed a little bit of what you were saying, Rodney, but that they're Main & Vine. Maybe just talk a little bit about what the goal is with that test and where you think that can go? W. McMullen: The -- we think it's always important to be trying different approaches to connecting with customers. As you know, we've had phenomenal success in natural and organic over the last several years, and we really see customers continuing to see that as important. But with that said, there are certain items where the customer still wants to buy every day stuff. And when you look at Main & Vine, what we're trying to do is to merge those 2 pieces but connect at a local level a little deeper than we normally would. Meredith Adler : And that would be a smaller store of 35,000, 40,000 square feet as opposed to what you build for most new Kroger's? W. McMullen: Yes, the store would be probably more likely in the 22,000 to 30,000 square-foot type store. Meredith Adler : Okay. And then just at the other end, and I'm assuming that Main & Vine is not aimed at the lowest income customer, I know you've been testing Ruler, what are your thoughts about that format or whatever you need to do to extend the test? All these going to be expanding, I'm not sure how significant it will be, but customer feedback is actually surprisingly good about all these. So maybe you could just talk about your dealing with that lower-end customer. W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at Main & Vine and Ruler, they are definitely targeted to a different customer. So I would agree with your comment completely. On Ruler, we're still trying to understand the economics of the model to get to where it actually performs at an ROIC that we're happy with. We continue to make progress, but we do not think we'd figured it out. We have a tremendous amount of respect for all the Lidl as well. We've spent as much time in Lidl stores as we have Ruler -- or as all these stores over the years. And Lidl has done a great job when you look at a lot of the European countries. So we have a lot of respect for those formats. There are certain customers that we believe likes to shop in that environment. Everything we can tell, it's not all customers. This is a customer segment, and what we're trying to do is to serve that segment. And if you look at Main & Vine, it's the same thing. There's a customer segment that we don't think anybody out there is really serving. And we're trying to identify a model that will serve that customer. Meredith Adler : And I guess my follow-up question on Main & Vine. Is that -- do those stores need to be located where the customer is low or middle income? Or is it more that it's near a fair amount of population that isn't very affluent? W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at Main & Vine, it's very, very early, and we only have one store and it's only been open a few weeks. From a customer demographics, we would be looking more at a customer that would be overly influenced on speed and convenience for dinner and a little bit more bent for natural and organic. So that would be the customer that we will be looking for, and it would be driven by -- more by that than economics. Thanks, Meredith. And I know -- I think this is your last call. Really appreciate you following us over the years, and best wishes on the beautiful retirement. And thank you for the partnership with Kroger, and thank you for the friendship. J. Schlotman: Take care, Meredith. Operator : And the next question will come from Robbie Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Robert Ohmes : I'm going to cheat and sneak in 2 quick ones. Just another one on inflation. You guys commented on the protein deflation and then produce being inflationary this quarter. Can you give us any color on just what's playing out in center of store overall from an inflation or deflationary standpoint? Any kind of thoughts looking into -- through 2016 here? And maybe tied into that, just competition, any update there? Walmart has been making efforts in produce in the supercenters. Neighborhood Market actually had a very good comp still in the most recent quarter. Just anything competitively, maybe even specifically, versus Walmart you can comment on? J. Schlotman: When you look at the grocery category from an inflation or deflation standpoint in the fourth quarter, it was slightly inflationary. I would remind you that, for us, we categorize milk and the dairy case overall in the grocery category. If you were to take the effect of lower cost and lower retails of milk out, the grocery department would have been closer to 1% inflation. And relative to the competitive environment, we pay attention to every competitor and what they're doing. As Rodney said, we get into a lot of our competitor's stores. I think a lot of this when we travel around, whether it's domestically or internationally, we probably often get into as many or more competitor stores as our own stores to keep an eye on what everybody else is trying to do. But what we really wake up every day trying to do is to make sure we're focused on our customers and understand what our customers want and try to deliver more on that every day. Certainly, in the background is what the competitive landscape is, but with knowledge and understanding we have of what drives our customers, that is our primary focus. W. McMullen: And one other thing I would just add, and this is a Kroger comment, yes, we've invested a lot in our Fresh departments, especially this year, and we've invested a lot in labor to improve the experience for our customers. I know our customers are giving us good feedback on what we've done. I think every competitor is really working hard to get better, and the customer's telling us, the changes we're making, they like what we do. Robert Ohmes : And just on the grocery inflation ex milk, anything we should think about for 2016 that would make it different than what you guys saw in 2015? J. Schlotman: Yes. I guess I would answer that as, who knows? I mean, you could have a weather disruption or any number of items that happened during the year. You could have a bumper crop of corn and wheat or a horrible crop of corn and wheat that changes the dynamics of not only the Fresh departments but the Grocery categories. I think we've -- when you look at our own ability or inability to predict where LIFO may wind up, when you're really predicting inflation on one day at the end of the year, the amount of units you'll have, it's just so volatile. Our job is we try to understand what's going on, on a regular basis and make sure we're delivering on our customers' wants and needs. Operator : The next question is from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : So first one is -- Mike, I know you'd talked a lot about and you gave us color on some of the expense pressures that you saw during Q4 and, it sounds like a lot or many of them could be transitory. Just want to get a sense of what type of expense pressures do you expect in 2016 on your business? J. Schlotman: Well, there's always expense pressures out there. And as I said in the prepared comments, there were some that we would expect to be -- to mitigate and go away over time, most likely by the end of the first quarter, things like the chargebacks from the EMV conversion. We can and will need to do a better job on shrink control. We know that opportunity is out there, and it's staring us in the face. We have some processes and tools that we're testing today that -- to make us more successful in that category. We also understand that, as I said in our labor negotiations, pension and health care costs, there are some that we face that some of our non-union competitors don't face the same extent, and we have to make sure that's front and center as we negotiate the list of contracts I spoke of that are up this year. W. McMullen: And when you look at the year overall, we would expect to be able to continue to manage for our costs are going down. And we have a ton of process changes that we're working on to take cost out of the business. J. Schlotman: Yes. I actually agree, Rodney. Our goal is year-over-year to be able to continue to reduce our total operating costs. W. McMullen: As a percent of sales. J. Schlotman: Right. W. McMullen: Without fuel. Rupesh Parikh : Great. And my follow-up question, is it possible to get the quarter-to-date trends? W. McMullen: If you look at quarter-to-date on identicals, it would be a little bit below the bottom of the range. That's consistent with where we thought we would be at this point. The weather -- the cycling of weather continues to be -- because we just basically had no weather benefits, but if you look at where we are, it's consistent with where we thought we would be so far. Operator : Our next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : So just curious if you guys can talk to the impact of the capital program. I guess specifically this year on the P&L, and then also cash flow. Meaning, will the -- with all of the incremental footage, does that weigh on EBIT -- ex fuel EBIT margin a bit? Is this the peak year for that? And then how does this impact utilization of free cash, particularly how you think about buyback? J. Schlotman: I think the -- I don't think this will be the peak year, but it'll be getting close to the peak year. We're going to -- when you talk about 100 major store projects for us, we haven't done that many major projects in quite a while. They will be -- they are typically a drag for a while before they start generating positive EBITDA. So I don't think we're there yet. It's certainly -- when we build our model, we certainly contemplate the effect of our capital program as well as making sure that we continue to get the contribution from those stores that are 1 year or 2 old today that should be throwing off some significant EBITDA to help us manage through the process. W. McMullen: And -- yes, but it would be very close. John Heinbockel : And how about the cash flow impact? J. Schlotman: Say that again? W. McMullen: Cash flow. John Heinbockel : Just the cash flow impact. J. Schlotman: I think if you look at our free cash flow generation over the last several years, I think we're in a good spot relative to being able to continue to execute with -- the expanded CapEx, a strong dividend, and we expect it to grow over time as well as executing a buyback strategy. We would expect to do all 3 of those. W. McMullen: When you look at it on a cash flow, we've also made great progress on improving working capital, which is funding part of it as well. John Heinbockel : And then maybe for you, Rodney, more strategically, when you think about the nonfood side of the marketplace, how do you -- how would you -- how do think that will evolve? How would you like that to evolve? And is it possible you can get broad distribution of more brands that maybe you haven't been able to get to date? W. McMullen: Well, we would certainly expect, over time, that there would be more of the brands -- bigger brands, would sell to us when those companies understand that we're going to treat their brand and respect their brand and support it just like they do. And we partner with a ton of great branded companies out there. And what we believe we can do over time is to show them that we're going to take care and grow and support their brand just like they do. If you look at the nonfood side of the marketplace store, we think it will continue to evolve over time. So it's one of those things where what we do today is different than what we did 2 years ago. What customers tell us is they like what we do today better than we did 2 years ago. But we still think there's still -- it will never stop evolving. But as you know, when you look at the grocery side, it doesn't stop evolving either. And customers give us good feedback on that side of the store because it's things they pick up because they find a great value for what they find, that's something at a very reasonable price. Operator : And the next question will come from Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley. Vincent Sinisi : I wanted to ask a bit further on Roundy's. Can you guys just give us a little bit more color in terms of, now you're a month and a half or so in, what have you found to be kind of, let's take the main conventional banners for a second in terms of the amount of work that needs to be done. Is it more kind of assortment? What percentage may need more kind of true remodels or anything like that? And then maybe on Mariano's, anything worth noting that needs to be done versus maybe just looking towards future expansion? W. McMullen: Yes, if you look at Mariano's, that brand is incredibly strong and it's really supporting the brands that's been built and continuing to build out that. When you look at Wisconsin, it really reminds me of where Kroger was several years ago, and it's really embarking on the same journey that we've been on over the last several years in terms of all the items that you talked about. The 2 things -- I guess, 3 things : One, there's a lot of learnings that we can bring back into Kroger from Mariano's. If you look at some of the things that we're really working hard with Roundy's in total, it's bringing the synergies of $110 billion company to procurement and using 84.51\u00b0 to help with insights there that we've obviously had a long successful journey on. I don't know, Mike, anything else you would want to add? J. Schlotman: No. I mean, we spent a lot of time in the Wisconsin market before we decided to go ahead with the merger. I don't think -- there's probably not a store in Wisconsin that some member of our senior management team hasn't been in and many of the stores we would have been in multiple times all over the state. We understood -- we had a good understanding of what investments we're going to need to make in infrastructure, what improvements we may need to make from potential resets or incremental hours in stores to better serve customers. So we factored in the things that before we could actually sit down and -- across the table of what we thought we needed to do to bring them back to the market share they once had. W. McMullen: We really feel good about the people. And as you know, Roundy's was -- had a tremendous amount of debt, which really didn't give them the financial flexibility to do some of the things they would've liked to have done. And we really -- the associates on Roundy's, they care so much about the customers. The senior leadership really does want to support the stores on improving the experience for customers. So that's one area where I thought we would feel good about, but I actually feel even better than what we thought going in. Vincent Sinisi : That is helpful. And maybe just one more quick one here. Just going back to Main & Vine, and appreciate the color with Meredith's question there. But just to kind of help us picture until the folks on this phone can get into the store itself. But I know it's early, but can you just give us a little bit more sense for, is there going to be a lot of Simple Truth, private label offering, kind of maybe a little bit more around the initial mix that you're testing at this point? Or -- and anything else that would be helpful? W. McMullen: Well, probably the biggest thing that would be easy is if you look at the Fresh departments, the amount of space dedicated to Fresh departments would be very high. The other thing that we would do is really try to make sure we're doing all we can to support local food suppliers. So local coffee, local cheeses, local bakery, those items. If you look at the grocery side, that would really be -- there would be Simple Truth in the store, but there would also be a lot of natural and organic. I don't -- and I guess, the other departments that would be a little bit expanded would be on the health and wellness and cosmetics and some of those things and even supporting the local community. Mike just made another point to me that we used our 84.51\u00b0 insights to what to carry in the store and how to set the store. So -- and it's a store where we've completely used the data to determine that. Operator : And our next question comes from Kenneth Goldman of JPMorgan. Kenneth Goldman : I was a bit surprised to hear that the quarter-to-date ID number was light or lighter than, I think, some people hope for because I would've thought that the Super Bowl shift would have helped a bit. And I would've thought, just based on your guidance, for 1Q to be better, that maybe the top line would've been better there. So maybe those things are true, but just the lack of favorable weather was bigger than we thought. I'm just trying to get some sense of the sizing of the impact of, I guess, football and weather on the quarter and also sort of an explanation, and maybe I just missed it, of the -- how the comp sales are going to be lower but the EPS are going to be higher at the ends of your ranges? J. Schlotman: When you look at the quarter to date, it is -- Super Bowl selling was great. But almost every week or, really, every day when we get ID sales, it seems there's some geography that was up against weather last year and no weather this year. That's going to flush itself out. Those things happen occasionally. It's our job to manage through it. Tonnage has remained strong. We feel good about where we're trending on those pieces. I don't think it's an issue from our tonnage or our growth or our customers coming in the store. We saw great trends in the fourth quarter, when we weren't up against weather, when our total households that came to our stores increased, the visits per households in total increased, and units per basket in the fourth quarter increased. And those kinds of things, over time, that's the momentum you want to see going into the new year. So we'll work our way through that. Relative to your question on IDs not where they were, but EPS up, I would go back to my comment on the meat department, where you just can't assume that if ID sales aren't as strong as they were -- that's just a percentage calculation. What you have to understand is what's the cost of that product, what can I sell it for and how many gross profit dollars do I make off of that? In many instances, like meat, because of the pickup in the volume at lower retails, you wind up generating significantly more gross profit dollars, and we would expect that to continue to play out in different categories throughout the year. Think about the effect that's had on milk on the top line. Milk generated a good profit in the year for us. Headwind to reported ID sales -- absolutely. But overall, the generation of profitability in milk was strong for the year. W. McMullen: Yes. And remember, the other comment I made earlier is we would expect inflation to be lower in the early part of the year and higher at later part of the year. But when you look at inflation overall, we've operated our business in low inflation and high inflation, and we've been successful in both environments. Kenneth Goldman : And then my follow-up, on M&A, I think you said that -- and you've said this previously, you're always looking for something, whether it's capabilities or a geography that you don't have today, I think one of the concerns out there is that Kroger may be more amenable to deals that would be considered, I guess, surprising to The Street than they used to be. Because looking for something you don't have today kind of leaves you open to almost anything. You can go into a new format, a new country. So I'm just curious for investors out there listening, are there limitations to what you'd buy even if it's something that you would consider new in terms of what you don't have now? W. McMullen: Yes, the -- I'll go back to what I said before. You shouldn't expect the way we would look at merging any different today than over the last several years. And as you mentioned in your comments, you should assume that we would look at most things; and I add a second ago in the U.S. So you shouldn't think that all of a sudden, you're going to see us in some place that we have no knowledge or no synergies. On the capability, I mean, we're really looking at things that are in our core business. So I mean, we're in the food business and we're in the health and wellness business. So I mean, those are the areas where we're going to be focused on; how do we get a deeper and better connection with our customers. So you shouldn't assume something that's out in left field. Operator : Next question comes from Zachary Fadem of Wells Fargo. Zachary Fadem : Just to stick with Roundy's for a minute. How are you thinking about the timeline of just integration and investments throughout fiscal '16? And have you started to roll out things like price investments and store improvements yet? And given the volatile deflationary environment, have you considered delaying price investments in certain categories? J. Schlotman: We have a timeline developed for how we're going to work with the Roundy's team, particularly in Wisconsin. I'm not going to get into what that timeline is. But you should assume it's not just a 2016 effort. It would be very similar to how we've done overall investments at Kroger. And it will be multifaceted over a number of -- over a fairly long-time horizon. I don't think there's anything in our minds that would cause us to delay what we think we need to do at Roundy's because of the current operating environment. We're -- as Rodney said, we're as bullish as we were 6 months ago when we were looking at this. It's only been 2 months. The deal closed December 18, so it's only been, okay, 2.5 months. You certainly didn't disrupt our team or their team during the holiday selling season. So it was really after the first of the year where we first started sitting down one-on-one with them and developing plans and strategies. And we feel very good about what our plans are going forward. W. McMullen: We've done a ton of work on research and working with the Roundy's team to try to understand the customer and understand the customer wants and needs. And the plan will actually be starting to execute against our understanding of the customer wants and needs. And some of it will be test and some of it will be to go do it. Zachary Fadem : Great. And just as a follow-up. Big picture, you've implemented a ton of productivity initiatives over the years in your stores, shorter checkouts, labor efficiencies. I'm curious where you think there's additional room for improvement in your stores. You mentioned shrink as one of them. Is there anything new planned for fiscal '16 to drive better efficiency, particularly with so many remodels and expansion projects planned? W. McMullen: The short answer is yes, and I'm trying to figure out a way to give -- help you give insight without giving away something that our competitors wouldn't know about. There are several projects that we have underway. Technology and process change would be a big part of those. And if you look at the things for '16, there would be an executed [indiscernible], and we're actually starting to work on some of the things that we'll do in '17 as well. Operator : That final question will come from Kelly Bania of BMO Capital Markets. Kelly Bania : Just wanted to go back to the guidance and the inflation outlook for a second. If I'm hearing you correctly, so the ID guidance 2.5% to 3.5% includes the 40 to 50 basis points drag from Roundy's. So if you take that out, you're kind of in that 3% to 4% range, which is just what you guided to last year, and also you'd also guided to a 1% to 2% inflation outlook last year. So am I right to think that it's really the same but that maybe the products within the categories are a little bit different and the pace may be accelerating throughout the year instead of decelerating throughout the year? Or what's really different, I guess? J. Schlotman: You did a better job of explaining what we were saying. The -- really, that's what we would think is early in the year, we're cycling a little the inflation higher last year, lower this year. We would expect as we get later in the year that we would be a little higher inflation, if you think about the dairy comment that Mike made. We'll soon start cycling lower dairy prices and some of those things. So your comment is absolutely correct on all those pieces. Kelly Bania : And then what's -- just in terms of the drag from Roundy's this year, is that something that we should think about for maybe a couple of years? Or what's a reasonable timeframe to expect that to maybe not get in line with the rest of the base but to be less of a drag? W. McMullen: The -- if you just look at our own models, we would think it would take 2 to 3 years to where it -- before it would get to where it would look more like a typical Kroger division. If you look at -- in our merger model, that's the type of timeframe that we used. And we wouldn't see it any different today than -- I don't know, Mike, any other insight you would want to add to that? J. Schlotman: I agree with you. We aren't going to go too fast and we aren't going to go too slow. And if we were to have a bias towards one or the other, it will be a little bit slower than a little bit too fast because what we have seen in the broad spectrum of M&A out there is when folks go -- try to go a little too fast, they're usually not as successful long-term. Kelly Bania : Got it. And just wanted to maybe end with just a question on Simple Truth. I think you said it was growing at an incredible rate. I think it's been in the double-digit range in the past. Just what are you seeing there? What are you expecting from Simple Truth in 2016? I think you mentioned some new categories that have been launched in the recent year. How are you thinking about even more categories? Or what are you expecting, really, from that in 2016? J. Schlotman: Yes. Your -- it has been incredibly strong. As I mentioned it was $1.5 billion brand for us last year. And if you recall, 3 years ago, is when we launched the brand. We're finding very good early results. We're really looking at it more as a lifestyle brand versus narrow or just food and the additional categories we've added, the -- it's been very good initial customer connection. So we really see continued growth opportunity for the brand and probably even stronger than what we would have thought initially. So it's exciting. W. McMullen: Before we end today's call, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. As you know, a lot of our associates listen into the call each quarter. Our strong results in 2015 are the result of your hard work and dedication to our customers, each other and the communities that we serve. I want to thank each of you for what you do every day to make a difference for our customers. Sometimes even simple things make someone's day brighter, like when Kroger associates in Tennessee worked with a community partner to deliver flowers to seniors, or when our Fry's team celebrated a special customer's 101st birthday at a Tucson store. Just awesome. Our customers appreciate your thoughtfulness. Keep up the great work. Across the country, we continue to listen to our associates' feedback. In addition to solid pay, healthcare, pension and other benefits, you told us that work-life balance is important, too. That's why we are introducing advance notice work schedules for associates working in our stores. This means associates will have their work schedule further in advance every time. This is designed to help you plan and manage other important things such as school, family and other events and responsibilities; 14 of our retail divisions have introduced this or are doing so now. And several others will have launched by the end of the first quarter. We work closely with our union locals who introduced this. So far, feedback from our associates have been very positive. As always, thank you, again, for your continued commitment to Kroger and our customers. That completes today's call. Thanks for joining. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Kate Ward, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kate Ward : Thanks, Laura. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our first quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.  I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. W. McMullen: Thank you, Kate. And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's first quarter results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman.  Our associates delivered another solid quarter. We continue to execute our growth plan and to deliver on our financial performance commitments. Most importantly, we continue to strengthen our connection with our customers, growing loyalty and market share and achieving Kroger's 50th consecutive quarter of positive identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel. Most companies can only aspire to achieve these results. It says a lot about our consistently remarkable performance and our ability to grow in a balanced way with a long-term focus.  We've managed through nearly every conceivable operating environment and demonstrated through different cycles that by providing value to our customers and partnering with our associates, we'll continue to make a difference for our customers, associates and communities. And when we do that, we create value for shareholders as evidenced by our growing dividend and our consistent net earnings per diluted share growth above our long-term guidance of 8% to 11%. In fact, our net earnings per diluted share growth rate on a compounded annual basis was 14.1% for 3 years and 18.8% for 5 years.  We demonstrate our long-term focus by continuing to invest for the future. We are making investments in our people, our digital and online capabilities and our strategic partnerships. Across the board, Kroger has an incredibly strong management team and a deep bench of leaders, who are making us better every day. We continue to make strategic investments in leadership development and training for all of our associates, including high-volume store managers and future senior leaders. Many people come here for a job, and Kroger creates opportunities for all associates to build a career.  Despite record low unemployment figures, when we held a 1-day hiring event in every supermarket location in May, we received more than 116,000 applications. From that pool, we hired more than 12,000 new associates. We see our opportunity culture as a competitive advantage.  We are expanding our digital presence and marching steadily toward a time when we can provide our customers with anything, anytime, anywhere. As you know, we are taking a disciplined approach to digital growth, testing new offerings in local markets so we can make sure we get it right before we scale offerings more broadly.  Our ClickList and ExpressLane offerings are now available in 25 markets with more to come. Our merger with Harris Teeter gave us a base of learnings that allowed us to ramp up quickly the development of ClickList. Customers now have downloaded nearly 3 billion digital coupons and offers from our mobile app and website, and we continue to experiment with Vitacost.com's ship-to-home technology and platform.  Earlier this week, Kroger's technology business unit was named one of the Top 100 Places to Work by Computerworld Magazine. We are obviously very proud of this honor. We've launched a new website, kroger.com/liveKT, to connect with and recruit top talent from around the world to join the Kroger team.  Similarly, we are finding out that ClickList also serves as a great tool to both hire and retain great people. Kroger is a fantastic place for tech talent to build careers because the technology they create can improve the lives of millions of customers each and every day.  In April, we announced a strategic investment in Lucky's Market, a specialty grocery store chain focused on natural, organic and locally grown products currently operating in 22 locations. We invested in Lucky's because of their great people and unique go-to-market strategy, which includes smaller-format stores that resemble an indoor farmers market, plus the culinary department that showcases amazingly restaurant-quality prepared foods. Lucky's approach is very much aligned with our efforts to provide affordable, fresh, organic and natural foods as part of our Customer 1st strategy. We expect to learn a lot from each other.  There are a lot of questions about the economy and the customer, inflation or lack thereof, consumer sentiment or competition. These are all issues that we've managed through, some several times over the last 50 quarters. Inflation, for example, I've often said that a 2% to 3% inflation would be a great environment to operate in. However, you rarely get the perfect operating environment. What we know is that by focusing on our associates and our customers will be a winning formula in the future as it has been in the past. At times like this, it's even more important to have 84.51\u00b0 on the team so we can generate insights into what our customers want and figure out a way to give them that without having to guess at it. Kroger's core business is solid. We are providing exceptional customer service in the highest-quality, freshest products. Customers are giving us higher marks for better product selection and store layout as well as friendlier service. We remain focused on customer loyalty that grows tonnage in both our top and bottom lines, which then creates value for shareholders.  Where we are right now, it looks like we will be at the low end to midpoint of our 2016 net earnings per diluted share range. Where we end up in that range will be driven primarily by fuel margins. I do want to stress that we are never satisfied and our to-do list remains longer than our done list.  Now Mike will offer more details on Kroger's first quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for the remainder of the year. Mike? J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. IDs came in at 2.4%. As Rodney said, we've been in environments like this before, and we will continue to focus on growing households, growing units and making sure we are delivering the right value proposition for our customers.  Inflation was nonexistent in the first quarter. Lower inflation has persisted and, in fact, was slightly deflationary without pharmacy. When you add pharmacy back in, we had approximately 30 basis points of inflation. This is the lowest we have seen in the last 6 years. During the quarter, trips per household were up and units per basket declined. This, combined with more households, led to positive tonnage growth.  Operating costs, excluding fuel and Roundy's, were 4 basis points better in the first quarter. Operating, general and administrative expenses were 11 basis points better and grew by approximately 2.9%. Rent and depreciation were a combined 7 basis points worse. We continue to work diligently to keep operating costs in check. As you know, this is the fuel we use to run our Customer 1st strategy, and as Rodney just said, this is an area where our to-do list is longer than our done list.  Now for an update on retail fuel. In the first quarter, the average retail price of a gallon of gas declined by $0.45 compared to last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.143 compared to $0.116 in the same quarter last year. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, we were at $0.182 this year compared to $0.184 last year. We expect this downward trend to accelerate as we cycle some very strong margin quarters for the rest of the year.  Our first quarter net earnings per diluted share increased 12.9% to $0.70 compared to $0.62 during the same period last year. This result was helped primarily by our operating results and higher fuel margins during the first quarter. A lower LIFO expense and share buybacks also contributed to the EPS growth. Our integration with Roundy's is well underway. Synergies are coming together nicely. We are beginning to focus on the physical assets in Wisconsin while continuing to open new Mariano stores in Chicago. Roundy's associates share our deep commitment to putting our customer first, which makes it easy for us to work together as one team.  For our corporate brands portfolio, we are off to an exciting start on the new innovation in 2016. Last quarter, we told you that we had just introduced Simple Truth household and personal care products, expanding our popular natural and organics line into a true lifestyle brand. Customers have responded enthusiastically as both sales and unit volume have exceeded our expectations in all categories. We continue to launch new Simple Truth offerings in laundry, household, baby and health and beauty care.  We also continue to push the boundaries of culinary trends with new Private Selection spices, marinades, condiments and cooking sauces. Customers are savoring global flavors in our delicious Private Selection products such as Korean black garlic kalbi marinade and Peruvian Aji Amarillo hot sauce. During the first quarter, corporate brands represented approximately 27.9% of total units sold and 25.9% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy.  The company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.12x compared to 2.09x during the same period last year. This result illustrates our commitment to use free cash flow to both grow our business and return cash to shareholders while remaining -- while maintaining an appropriate level of leverage for our credit rating.  Over the last year, Kroger used free cash flow to repurchase $1.1 billion in common shares, paid $397 million in dividends, invest $3.6 billion in capital and merged with Roundy's for $866 million. Kroger's strong EBITDA performance resulted in a return on invested capital for the first quarter of 14.08%, excluding Roundy's, compared to 14.03% for the first quarter of 2015. Our balance sheet is as strong as ever.  I will now provide a brief update on labor relations. We recently agreed to new contracts covering store associates in Houston, Indianapolis, Portland and Roanoke. We are currently negotiating contracts with UFCW for store associates in Little Rock, Nashville and Southern California. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, have a shared objective : growing Kroger's business and profitably, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.  Turning now to our 2016 guidance. We continue to expect identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of approximately 2.5% to 3.5% for 2016. This reflects lower inflation as well as Roundy's results, which are an approximate 30 basis point headwind to identical supermarket sales growth. For full year net earnings, we expect 2016 range of $2.19 to $2.28 per diluted share. As Rodney said earlier, based on current fuel margin trends, we expect to be at the low end to midpoint of our guidance range. We expect fuel margins will be at or slightly below the 5-year average.  Shareholder return will be further enhanced by a dividend that is expected to increase over time. And thinking about the cadence of our quarterly results compared to our long-term 8% to 11% guidance, we believe that the second quarter will be the toughest quarter with slight growth over 2015. Keep in mind the second quarter last year grew by 26%. Both the third and fourth quarters will be at the low end to midpoint of the range.  We continue to expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to be in the $4.1 billion to $4.4 billion range for 2016.  Finally, we continue to expect Kroger's full year LIFO -- full year FIFO operating margin in 2016, excluding fuel, to slightly expand compared to 2015 results.  Now I will turn it back to Rodney. W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike. We are proud of our team's performance during the quarter, especially in light of the challenging operating environment. We've been through business cycles like this before. The best thing we can do is to deliver on our promise while investing for the future. We will continue to execute our Customer 1st strategy, and by doing so, we'll create long-term value for our shareholders.  Now we look forward to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Ed Kelly of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Edward Kelly : Can we maybe start off with just color on the cadence of the IDs through Q1, what you're seeing so far in Q2? And then, Rodney or Mike, could you maybe dissect sort of like tonnage trends versus inflation trends and then lastly, as part of all this, the impact that Roundy's had on the Q1 comp? W. McMullen: Okay. Ed, I'll start out and let Mike fill in. But if you look across the quarter, I would say it bounced around a bit. Part of that was driven by weather. Earlier in the quarter, we had basically no weather benefits this year versus a lot in the prior year. As you get toward the end of the quarter, Memorial Day moved from the first quarter to the second quarter, and early in the quarter, you had Super Bowl. So there's a lot of things going on. The other thing on inflation, inflation, we had expected that it would start picking up some, and when we look going forward, we just don't see that picking up. If you look at so far this quarter, we're inside the range, just slightly below the midpoint of the range of the 2.5% to 3.5%, but as you know, it's still very early in the quarter. Overall, the core continues to be strong, and we're cycling incredibly strong numbers from last year, and tonnage continues to be solid. I don't know, Mike, anything else you'd want to add or thoughts? J. Schlotman: No. One of the things we have done is if you look at our real growth, that's IDs minus the inflation number that we give,-- if you look at the 2-year stack of that, it's amazingly consistent quarter-to-quarter, less than a 50 basis point swing when you look at it over the last 5 or 6 quarters. So when you look at things over a little bit longer time frame and you take out the effects of inflation on the reported numbers, our results have actually been amazingly consistent. Edward Kelly : And, Mike, just the impact of Roundy's on that 2.4% you report this quarter? J. Schlotman: It's about 30 basis points. Operator : And the next question will come from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : I know it's still early with ClickList in some markets, but what have you seen thus far in terms of how that's changing consumer behavior? And is it yet a new customer acquisition vehicle? W. McMullen: The -- as you started out your question, it's obviously very early. And as I mentioned in the prepared comments, we're now in 25 markets. What we're finding is almost anything you say would be correct. So there's some new customers, and we find in some situations, a customer will spend more with us. But as you know, we're so focused on what is it the customer wants and needs are, and what we have is some of our customers tell us they really appreciate it. And that's really why we're focused on it and continue to roll it out because some customers find it incredibly helpful. We definitely -- from everything that we see, we find it's an and, and not an or. And the ClickList customer continues to come into the store, and it really is just one more way of making their life a little bit easier. John Heinbockel : Okay. And then I guess just as a follow-up, do you see -- do you think there'll be -- there's any difference in how you run -- will run ClickList or customer behavior in a marketplace versus a traditional food retail store given size differences and so forth? W. McMullen: The -- we have it in both types of stores, and we really find the behavior isn't that much different, but we do not have the Marketplace product on the website. So somebody -- if somebody wants to buy something from the Marketplace side, they have to put it in the comment section, \"Can you get me that?\" and obviously, we will. But the -- we don't see differences in behavior between one type and other. One of the things that's always part of the consideration is do we have space to do it in a store, and that's driven as much the decision on a size of store. There's some Marketplace stores we don't have it in that we'd like to have it in because we just really don't have the space to do it. Operator : And next we have a question from Shane Higgins of Deutsche Bank. Shane Higgins : How much do you guys characterize the macro environment in the quarter? And any color you have on just the consumer side, I mean, overall? I think you guys mentioned that units per transaction were down slightly. Is there -- is that any kind of indication that the consumer might be a bit softer? Or any color there would be great. J. Schlotman: Yes. When you look at the units per basket, they were down slightly, but that was overcome by more trips, making more trips to drive more units during the quarter. So the -- if you just looked at those 2 metrics, it would have been a slight increase in the tonnage, and then the new households pushed the tonnage to be nicely positive. I think Rodney touched the -- there's clearly a lot going on out there. The macro environment, there's the inflation, deflation. There's gas retails were rising during the quarter. There -- it was an interesting quarter, but there's so many unusual things out there. Our own comparisons to a lot -- like Rodney said, the Super Bowl this year, then the weather, then Memorial Day moving. As Rodney said, the cadence of ID sales was really a little bit all over the board depending on the week you're looking at. But our fundamental approach is focused on the customer, make sure we're delivering on the value propositions that they want. And -- but just based on how they're shopping with us, it sure seems like we're hitting the mark on that. W. McMullen: Yes. And the economy yet to me, and Mike and I have talked about this, it's really hard to describe, and it's very mixed. And how much of that is driven because of the election and everything else, I'll let somebody that has better insights into that than us to try to speculate on that. The strength certainly doesn't feel as strong as the numbers suggest. But with that said, if you look at the things that would be discretionary items or more upscale items if you look at wine, Boar's Head, Murray's, Starbucks, all of those continue to grow very nicely from an identical standpoint and well outperform the total. So it's really pretty hard to describe from what we can see. Shane Higgins : Yes, appreciate the color. And just a quick follow-up. So it sounds like you guys are driving additional trips. Is that a function of consumers utilizing your fuel rewards? Is it more of a shift towards fresh and produce, more produce, more fresh? J. Schlotman: You do see those types of items in a lot of the baskets of the incremental trip. And as people strive to eat healthier and eat more fresh products rather than buying it and putting it in the refrigerator or freezer, it does appear as though they're making their trips to the grocery store a little more regularly and buying for a few days rather than for a week-long stock-up. That's certainly what it seems to be. Operator : And our next question comes from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : First, I had a quick clarification to your answer to Ed on the quarter-to-date trends. I think you said you're slightly below the midpoint of the range. Is that correct? W. McMullen: Correct. Scott Mushkin : And then does that include or exclude the Memorial Day shift? W. McMullen: That would include the shift, the Memorial Day. Scott Mushkin : Okay. That's perfect. So you're at the -- kind of a little below with the shift included. Okay. It's perfect. And then my big question. Obviously, you got a competitor, a large competitor making a lot of noise around price. So have you seen anything in the marketplace where they've gotten more competitive? And they have done and delivered what they said they were going to deliver as far as cleanliness and in stock. How seriously do you guys take their comments about several billion dollars of price investments, and they're even willing to take deflation in their own comps or kind of lower their own comps to get that done? And what's the plan at Kroger to kind of combat that if it ends up happening? W. McMullen: Well, if you look, we take all competitors serious. So to say we only focus on one, we really do look at all competitors. And we think it's incredibly important to make sure we focus on what our customer needs are. And as you know, if you look on an annual basis, we've invested -- we are investing $3.6 billion in price today versus when we started on the journey. So we would have every intentions to continue to maintain our price position. But when you look at overall, the total customer, the way they look at value, it's much more than just price. And as you know, we stay focused on the total customer needs, and fresh products are incredibly important. What's the shopping experience? How long is the customer in line? How do they get treated by associates? All of those things are equally important, and we really are focused on continuing to improve all of those, and we've made substantial improvements in all of those. And the customer doesn't make a decision to shop-- where to shop based on only one dimension. And we think some of those other things create a very large competitive advantage for us. Scott Mushkin : Okay. Great. And then I had one question. Obviously, the 10-year bond has been falling quite steadily here over the last 3 or 4 months, and that, obviously, has impacts on pensions. And just want to get your guys thoughts on this. We've seen the drop, what, like 50, 60, 70 basis points or something like that. And how should we think about pensions next year? Any framework there, Mike, on that? Do you think about this or no? J. Schlotman: Well, of course, I think about it. The effect of the interest rate, it's really -- it's odd how a lot of pensions are calculated from the liability using  interest rates, the present value of the liability. If you look at state and local and federal pensions and multiemployer pensions, their liability is actually calculated using the expected rate of return, it's the discount rate. So UFCW plans, the way they calculate their unfunded status is really unaffected by changes in the interest rate unless they change their expected rate of return. It's the same way state -- it's just the way it's mandated to be done or is done. It would affect the company plan a little bit, but remember, our company plan is a frozen plan. There continue to be benefits earned by those who are still working and are participants in it, but there's no new participants in it. And we try to maintain the funded status of that enough so we don't have to do some reporting issues to participants. But I never want that fund to go overfunded because as the last person winds up getting their check, there's no easy way to get any excess money out of that. So we purposefully manage that to be slightly underfunded. We're not even -- to be underfunded because some day rates will go up, and I don't want to put a bunch of money in now and then wake up in 5 years and have the fund be overfunded because I can't do anything with it. Scott Mushkin : And any idea kind of a rule of thumb what the expected rate of returns on these UFCW plans are? And then I'll yield. J. Schlotman: They're a little bit all over the board. I would say in the 7s is the most common, not a lot different than state -- all the state pension plans -- they're all -- they all do it the same way. Operator : And the next question will come from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : Just on the topic of food inflation, deflation. This morning, the government data again showed the decline in food prices. So just want to get a sense of what your latest full year outlook is and how you're thinking about the cadence going forward. J. Schlotman: Well, as I said in prepared remarks, we would have expected to start seeing a little bit more inflation right now than when we were sitting here 3 or 4 months ago thinking about it, and it just hasn't happened. And as I sit here today, it certainly doesn't feel like we're going to have the pickup in overall food inflation. Milk would have been projected to start having some cost increases, but the federal market order on milk isn't showing any upward trend or not any significant upward trend. So I think we're going to wind up most of the year in a fairly low inflationary environment. W. McMullen: But as Mike mentioned before, tonnage continues to improve. We continue to improve market share. If you look at year-on-year, we continue to improve the connection with the customer, and our gross profit dollars and departments remain strong as well. So I think it's important to look at all those things together. Rupesh Parikh : Okay. Great. And then just going back to your commentary on traffic. If you look at traffic this past quarter versus recent quarters, has it improved? And if so, what's been some of the drivers do you believe behind the improvement? J. Schlotman: Well, we've continued to see strong growth in all households, including loyal and nonloyals. And I would go back to Rodney's prior comments on our unending -- the never-ending focus on the customer and making sure we understand what they want and figuring out a way to deliver that with them while still having the right value proposition for them and our shareholders. Operator : The next question will come from Andrew Wolf of BB&T Capital Markets. Andrew Wolf : On the food retail turning slightly deflationary, just to kind of echo Scott's question, is that being driven at all by competitors taking pricing down either more so than the deflation or just taking it down to try to get business going? Or is that all, as far as you can tell or mainly as far as you can tell, from the lower product costs? W. McMullen: If you look, almost all of it's in the fresh department. It's meat, seafood, deli. And all of those areas would be primarily driven by commodities. And then if you look in the grocery complex, milk would be a heavy deflation item, and that's, as Mike mentioned before, really driven by the federal market. So it's really -- it looks -- overall, it's more commodity-based versus competition-based. I don't know, Mike, anything you'd want to add to that? J. Schlotman: No, I absolutely agree. Andrew Wolf : Okay. And on the guidance, keeping the ID sales the same as before but on lower inflation obviously means you think the -- you're going to see improvement in volume. So it sounds like volumes picked up a bit, but what's sort of driving that outlook? Is it some... J. Schlotman: It's our expectation for the year. If you look at the first quarter, we delivered the 2.4% in exactly that kind of an environment, and that was without the weather from the prior year and Memorial Day moving. So we continue to focus on driving units, driving tonnage and making sure that the customer's getting the well-rounded shopping experience that Rodney just spoke of. Andrew Wolf : And if I could just get in a follow-up on ClickList, kind of a generic question on profitability. Is the current model -- let's say a store produces a reasonable amount of volume in ClickList, is that going to be as profitable as having a customer come in the store and pick their own groceries? Or does the model really have to shift to something that's scaled up, where you can have kind of a dedicated pick facility? W. McMullen: When you're in the start-up period, obviously, it's a headwind. There, it's more expense versus the other way. We certainly see that if you look at a model, we feel very comfortable the model can scale out to where, from a profitability standpoint, the customer can do either one, and we're completely indifferent. One of the things that our team has done a lot of work on is trying to make sure we design a ClickList model that can scale to whatever the volume it scales to. So if it's 5% of the business, we'll do fine at 5%. If it becomes 20%, we'll do fine at 20%. And our team really has done a lot of work to try to make sure we design a model that can scale and scale from a profitability standpoint and the consumer will let us -- lead us to where -- what they -- what percentage they want it to be. Operator : And our next question will come from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Kenneth Goldman : Is there any way that you can roughly quantify the benefit of the Memorial Day shift on 2Q today? Because you haven't really talked about that since 2004, and it's a long time ago. But from that, we estimate maybe a shift like that can help roughly about 100 basis points on a quarter-to-date number. So I'm just curious, is that roughly in the right range, meaning on a like-for-like basis, you're doing maybe a bit below 2% so far in the quarter, excluding the benefit from Memorial Day? W. McMullen: I don't know that we'll give you the exact number, but the 100 basis points isn't remotely correct. And don't forget you have the week after as well, and you really have to look at the 2 weeks together. Kenneth Goldman : Not remotely correct, meaning it's lower than 100 or higher? I'm hoping lower. W. McMullen: It's not even close to 100. J. Schlotman: Yes, you're not even in the right ballpark. Kenneth Goldman : Never been so happy to be wrong, but I appreciate it. J. Schlotman: I am as well. And if that's the impression that is out there, I've never been so happy to help you be wrong. Kenneth Goldman : Yes, that is the impression. So we'll be really smiling in the wrong house together. And then I want to follow up on EPS, and forgive me if this was asked, I didn't hear it. Coming in closer to the bottom or the midpoint of the range, but the reason that we cited was fuel, but you didn't -- unless I missed it, you didn't change your guidance for fuel margins coming in at or slightly below the 5-year average. That was the same verbiage you used last quarter. So I just wasn't quite sure what actually changed to cause you to reduce the outlook. J. Schlotman: Fuel continues to be very volatile, and it certainly -- again, sitting here in June trying to predict the rest of the year, and it certainly seems from what we see today that fuel will-- coming in at that or below it, we pumped a couple billion gallons of fuel in the first quarter, and a very smaller change in that retail cents per gallon adds up to a lot of money very quickly. So it's not like fuel has to change by $0.04 for it to affect our numbers in a big way. And it certainly seems that the trend would be closer to the below the 5-year average than at the 5-year average. But again, overall, it's really tough to predict. The last 4 days, oil has gone down. Is that going to lead to lower wholesale price of unleaded fuel? We'll know in the next few days. W. McMullen: Plus the first quarter was slightly better than where we expected it to be. J. Schlotman: Right, right. W. McMullen: But we only look at the year, we really don't see the change. Operator : The next question is from Zach Fadem of Wells Fargo. Zachary Fadem : Can we walk through some of the moving parts to the gross margin line in the quarter? With gross margin, ex fuel down slightly, can you talk about how things like deflation, price investments and the impact of Roundy's come into play here? J. Schlotman: Yes, I don't think I'll go down to that level of detail and walk through all the individual numbers. We continue to make the investments we plan to make in price throughout the first quarter. Certainly, the dynamics of deflation when you look at the whole gross profit margin for the entire company makes it kind of interesting because the -- as you have deflation, if you pass on exactly the lower cost to the customer, it drives your gross profit rate up. It's just simple math. Pharmacy continues to be a bit of a headwind to the gross profit numbers as well with some of the inflation in there and where the reimbursements rates are. So it's just a really big mixed bag. I would need several hours probably to explain it to you. Zachary Fadem : Okay. We'll take that one off-line then. W. McMullen: Sorry to interrupt, but when you look at it overall, it was pretty close to where we expected it to be. J. Schlotman: Yes. I mean... W. McMullen: And we executed our plan, as Mike said. J. Schlotman: I absolutely agree with that. Zachary Fadem : Okay. Great. And just secondly, there's been a lot of talk about the online meal prep companies like Blue Apron. Have you considered expanding into this business? And if so, how are you thinking about it in terms of build versus buy? W. McMullen: I want to answer, but I don't want it to sound flip. The short answer is absolutely. And as you can imagine, we would look at any and all approaches. The thing that's important is if we find somebody to make an investment in that they would value the leverage that we bring to the party as well and assign some value to that. So it's not just something that has pure option value in the way they're getting valued. So the short answer is yes, we would be very open to doing it on our own or doing it with somebody. And I think if you look at our track record, we've had both approaches. Operator : The next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth of Jefferies. Mark Wiltamuth : Wanted to dig in a little more on the Walmart question. We did a May price survey that was showing Walmart actually cutting in produce in 2 markets, cutting about 9% and 5% to 6% cutting in another market. Are you seeing that in your view of marketplace? And do you think it really matters relative to your offering in produce since you have a broader offering and a little more robust? W. McMullen: I don't know that I want to go in specifics because if you look at over the last, say, 2 years, you're going to find that type of variance among all retailers when you get down to a specific market, and it's really which market are you looking at. So I would hesitate to say there's something that's just fundamentally changing because you'll see those behaviors in specific markets all the time, because any of us, there may be some market that we're trying to cause something to happen. If you look -- as you know, for us, we've invested a ton of resources and labor improving the freshness of our products and especially in the produce department. And our customers are telling us we've -- we're making meaningful improvements in what they see from a freshness standpoint in produce, specifically. We're getting the same thing in other departments, but produce would be one as well. And for us, it's really important the progress we're making to continue to make improvements from that. And as you know, from an organic produce standpoint, we find that we have outstanding variety of organic, and customers continue to connect with that in a much deeper way. J. Schlotman: Yes, and inflation in produce in the first quarter was almost 400 basis points lower than the fourth quarter. Still inflationary, but from fourth quarter to first quarter, it declined almost 400 basis points less inflation. Mark Wiltamuth : Okay. And, Mike, while we got you on, wanted to ask about the buyback. You did like $1 billion of buyback here in the quarter. Do you anticipate more throughout the rest of the year? Do you have any remaining in your buyback plan? And just give us an update on where you are there. J. Schlotman: I currently have exhausted the authority the board's given me. And if you look at our history, we don't like to be without authority for any particular point in time, and we have gotten the cadence over the last couple of years of front-end loading our buyback for the year. But we always want to have dry powder if the stock reacts in a way that we don't think is prudent based on our view of the underlying value of the company. Operator : And next, we have a question from Robby Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Robert Ohmes : I actually wanted to -- 2 questions. One, I wanted to see if I can dig a little bit more into the inflation or deflation versus your outlook. Mike or Rodney, is -- you guys have been talking about sort of good deflation versus demand-driven deflation. Are you -- I just want to clarify, are you starting to see some demand-driven deflation in your outlook that we should be concerned about? And maybe also, it was helpful that you comment on milk and perishables. What's the center-of-store inflation outlook for you guys now? Has that changed since you guys spoke to us last quarter? And then I have a follow-up. J. Schlotman: Yes, I would say it hasn't really changed very much other than it looks like it's going to come slower, which could lead to less inflation for the full year by the time we get to the end of the year. And really, as Rodney said earlier, everything we're seeing is really price-led deflation, not demand-driven. We haven't -- I'm not sure, trying to understand the view of demand-driven deflation on the fly here because the number we're talking about is what we pay for a product versus what we paid for it last year. So I'm not sure that demand would have to change rather dramatically in the marketplace for it to affect our grocery category. But everything we're seeing is just a little bit less inflation than we expected right now, and it look likes that's going to persist. Robert Ohmes : And then just on Roundy's, have you given us or can you give us a sort of rough -- what do you think the rough impact on the FIFO operating margin is from Roundy's for this fiscal year? And just to clarify, is that -- does it look like the amount you're going to have to invest in Roundy's, including Mariano's, is that -- are you guys saying that's tracking right on plan? Or is that maybe going to be a little more than you initially thought? Any color on that would be great. W. McMullen: If you look overall, it's tracking on plan. I would say the thing that's taken a little longer than we would have expected is to get the actual thing started. So if you look at Wisconsin, obviously, I mentioned it in the prepared remarks. But on remodeling stores and making some of those changes, it took a little longer to get started than what we would have guessed. Now why we thought we could get it started so quickly, I'm not sure, and we'll learn that for the next time we do something, because we're still doing it faster than what we can do it within one of our historical Kroger divisions. The thing that I would say that I'm extremely pleased with is the -- our associates in -- at Roundy's and how welcoming they are and how excited they are to be part of Kroger and making sure that we leverage the size of Kroger, and the synergies continued to actually come in better than what we were expecting a little bit. But as you know, we'll continue to invest those synergies into driving our business. I don't know, Mike, you work on it closer than I do. J. Schlotman: No, I agree, and I do agree with Rodney's comment. I'm not sure why we were as bullish as we were being able to get remodel started because with an early termination of the HSR filing, the time from announcement to close was very quick, and then you had the holidays because we closed on December 18. And it just takes a while to get plans drawn, to get sign-off on how we're going to remodel the stores and things like that. But I can -- you can rest assured that if we found the right partner in Wisconsin to go to, you would see a lot of activity going on in and around a lot of the stores today. Robert Ohmes : And for Mariano's, are changes that you plan there either to assortment or anything else, is that maybe running a little bit slower than initially hoped for? W. McMullen: Yes. Mariano's, there really isn't much of a focus on assortment. There may be some products that the team in Chicago asked for -- we'll, obviously, give them access to it, and we'll start carrying it. But in Mariano's, the focus is continuing to build more stores. And I think this year, we'll end up opening 4 or 5 stores in Chicago on a base of 30-some stores. So very aggressive capital plan there. Operator : And next, we have a question from Chuck Cerankosky of North Coast Research. Charles Cerankosky : I'd like to take another crack at that question about the economy but not so much about how the U.S. economy is growing or slowing or whatever the case may be, but really looking at customer behavior as they look at some of these fresh departments and experience lower prices. What are you seeing between, say, types of protein? Are we seeing trading between those categories simply because people are more impressed with a lower price than they were last year? W. McMullen: There's no doubt that you see people, like in beef, buying more beef, things like that. So those things are definitely happening, but some of those prices are the best prices that customers would have seen in, I want to say, almost 3 years, just reflecting back. So how much of it is driven because of economy and how much of it is just driven because it is a great -- it's a good value again given the changes in price. I don't know, Mike, you were looking at details. J. Schlotman: No, I absolutely agree with what Rodney said. And if you look at the meat category in particular, until we got into late 2015, in 2014, you had -- in the early part of '14, you had mid- to high single digits inflation, ended 2014 with double-digit inflation. Last year started off high, and then as we got into the third and fourth quarter, the prices really started coming down. And it's people buying -- perhaps buying more and people coming back into the categories what's driving it there. Operator : The next question comes from Alvin Concepcion of Citi. Alvin Concepcion : I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of just the overall competitive promotional environment in both conventional as well as natural and organic, how is it today versus what you saw in the quarter versus the prior quarter. And more specifically, have you seen any impact from all this in California? J. Schlotman: Again, we won't go into specific competitors or geographies. But we always assume the environment around us is going to get more competitive when we build the business plan. If you happen to have a year where that's not the case, that just makes it -- the year a little bit better. But the industry's always been very competitive, and we see no -- nothing out there that would cause it to be less competitive. And we go into every year with that assumption and build a business plan of how we can invest the dollars we have to invest for our customers' benefit to drive more tonnage and more trips to the store and increase loyal households. And as we continue to do that, you see the results as the number of our loyal households continue to grow, their trips to the store continue to grow and then the units they buy on a monthly or quarterly basis continue to grow. And that really winds up being our focus. As Rodney said earlier on competition and pricing environment, we don't ignore anybody. We know what they're doing, but we always come back to what does our customers want and how can we satisfy that need. Alvin Concepcion : Got it. And just as my follow-up, wondering how we should think about the puts and takes to margins over the next few quarters. I know fuel margins are a big impact, but how much of an impact do you expect from things like the overtime legislation? And are you fully EMV compliant at this point? J. Schlotman: We are EMV compliant, where you have to be EMV compliant. The C stores and fuel pumps and things like that have a different deadline to be implemented. Some of our merged companies aren't completely there yet because they started later than we had started, and we're working to get them caught up. But if you look at the pre -- if you look at -- Roundy's has some work to do on EMV compliance, relatively small piece of the total pie. So those things won't affect us. What was the first part of your... W. McMullen: Yes, on the labor changes, we would not have very many management people that would be below the new minimum wage. We are going through and understand exactly how it will impact us, but a rough guess on an annualized basis, it's probably -- right now our guess would be $15 million to $20 million for the whole year. So it's -- in the overall scheme of things, it's not a lot, but we're still in the process of making sure what's the best approach for all our associates, but we don't have that many people that make less than that. Operator : The next question comes from Kelly Bania of BMO Capital Markets. Kelly Bania : Wanted to circle back on Roundy's. It seems like their performance there was better than maybe your expectation, and just curious what drove that. Was that Wisconsin markets or Chicago? And do you think that 30 basis points -- are you looking for that 30 basis points drag for the next couple of quarters? Do you think that could continue to improve? Any color there? J. Schlotman: Yes, I would think the 30 basis points is what it will wind up affecting the full year by. They continue to have -- obviously, with it being a headwind, their sales trends are below the rest of the company. It's not like flipping a switch and all of a sudden, you put a program in, and they're done. We're going about this in a very methodical way, for lack of a better word, of making sure the stores are cleaned up, making sure they're reset, making sure stores are remodeled that need to be remodeled. Some may wind up being relocated. And then you step back and you figure out how to get the best value proposition to their customers like we've done premerger with Roundy's. So the good news is this is a game plan that we've used before as we invested in growing -- taking a business who had sluggish sales in Kroger at the turn of the century to a company that has very robust sales. And it's a strategy we would expect to implement in Wisconsin as we go throughout the year. But it won't be flipping a switch where all of a sudden, they'll -- they'll turn on a dime. W. McMullen: And if you look at our overall Roundy's strategy when we announced the merger, we really look at it as a 3-year approach, and obviously, some of the things that we've talked about as part of it. But as Mike just mentioned, real estate would be part of that remodeling stores, expanding stores. All of those things would be part of the total package. One of the reasons why we get excited about Roundy's was obviously Mariano's, but in addition to that, in Wisconsin, the quality of the real estate, most of the real estate they have there is very good locations and for the most part, good store sizes as well. Kelly Bania : Okay. That's helpful. Then just wanted to ask, when you look at your households, you're increasing penetration with new households in particular. Wondering if you have any color on what kind of customer that you're getting there, that new customer. Is that a higher-income customer? A lower-income customer? Is it a diverse group? Any analysis that you've done around that would be helpful. W. McMullen: It's very diverse. And if you look, it would certainly be heavily weighted to the mainstream and then scale from that. So it's diverse from ethnic diversity. It's diverse from income diversity. It's diverse from age, which, for us, we obviously get excited by it being all of those groups. Kelly Bania : Great. And then one -- just last one on the fuel margins for Mike. Is it fair to say 1% -- a $0.01 swing in the gas margin could be around $0.05 to the EPS? Is that rough ballpark the way to think about it? J. Schlotman: I don't -- I actually don't have that calculation handy. W. McMullen: For the year, that would be fairly close. J. Schlotman: Yes. For a quarter it wouldn't, as Rodney said, for the year it would be fairly close. Kelly Bania : For the year? J. Schlotman: Yes. Operator : The next question comes from Priya Ohri-Gupta of Barclays. Priya Ohri-Gupta: Mike, just a quick question on your view of the refinancing market right now. Looks like you had about $1.2 billion in CP, and you have $800 million maturing later this year. So just wanted to get your view on sort of continuing to use the CP market to roll some of your maturities versus terming them out in terms of the long-term market given where rates are. J. Schlotman: Yes, we do have the $800 million later this year and $500 million -- a little over $500 million in January. What -- the reason -- I would see as debt matures, terming that out as it comes closer, we have been putting interest rate hedges on that debt throughout time to take some of the interest rate risk off of the table if rates got away from us quickly. Relative to the commercial paper, you'll probably see us maintain commercial paper in that range. It's the easiest way, particularly with where commercial paper rates are today. It's the easiest way for us to get exposure to floating rates. If you want to modify your exposure to floating rates quickly, it's easiest to do that with commercial paper because assuming the markets are open, I can always term it out. If I have swaps or hedges or if I've done a 3- or 5-year floating rate note, you really can't change that quickly or eloquently, so that will be -- continue to be part of our strategy. Operator : And our final question will come from Ajay Jain of Pivotal Research. Ajay Jain : Actually, most of my questions have been asked already. My question's on Roundy's. Obviously, it's early in your experience there, but since last year's fourth quarter was a step period and now you've got 1 full quarter under your belt, I'm just wondering if you've seen any change sequentially in Roundy's operating performance. So sequentially, are you seeing any change there that's meaningful? J. Schlotman: Again, it's in the ballpark of what we expected them to be. We have -- as Rodney said, if there's anything on Roundy's of note from us internally, it's that -- just that we had a little bit higher expectations of how quickly we could do some of the things that have taken a little bit longer than we expected, but we do have some momentum going now. Ajay Jain : Okay. And I think you mentioned and Rodney mentioned things took a little longer to get started in Milwaukee. But can you also maybe comment on how you view the challenges for Roundy's in Chicago compared to Milwaukee? Obviously, they're very different formats and different customer demographics. But to the extent that there's any real variability in terms of how those markets are performing, can you speak to that at all? W. McMullen: In Chicago, it's completely different. Obviously, this condition of the store base is substantially very, very good. Most of the stores -- the first store was opened in 2010. They had acquired a bunch of stores from Dominick's when Dominick's left the market. They're in the process of remodeling those stores. But the rest of the stores are in very good condition. The biggest thing in Chicago is just cycling a lot of sister store impacts because there were so many incremental new stores because of the Dominick's acquisition. But it's really -- the focus there is to continue to execute the plan, continue to connect deeper with customers and grow our market share. And Chicago is a fantastic market that we really like. Before we end today's call, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. And as you know, I always like to tell our associates a few comments because we just have so many that listen in. And first, I want to take this -- take a moment to extend our deepest sympathies to the family and friends of those who lost their lives in the recent horrific attack in Orlando. What happened is tragic and heartbreaking. I also want to thank the first responders who put their lives in danger every day to protect us. I know our family of associates, those at Axiom Health Care outside of Orlando, across Florida and throughout the rest of the country is deeply saddened by what has happened. We stand in support of the LGBT community. An event like this affects each and every one of us. No matter where we live or work, it serves to remind us of what is most important, and that is taking care of each other. I want to thank our associates everywhere who demonstrate our values of diversity, inclusion and respect every day, to treat all with dignity, to seek and embrace the differences among people and to lift each other up. That completes our call today. Thanks for joining us, and have a good summer. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Kate Ward, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kate Ward : Thank you, Laura. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our second quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] Please save the date for our 2016 Investor Conference, which will be held in Cincinnati on November 1 and 2. Details will be coming soon, and we hope that you can join us.  I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. W. McMullen: Thank you, Kate. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's second quarter results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman.  Our core business remains strong in the second quarter as we continue to increase market share, improve tonnage and grow loyal households. As we often say, we are focused on the long-term performance over a 3- to 5-year horizon. We have the right strategy, the right people and the financial flexibility to execute our strategy, which allows us to continue investing in our associates, our business and grow market share.  By remaining focused on our strategy, we create long-term value for our shareholders. An example of staying on our strategy is continuing to add hours to support tonnage growth in a deflationary environment. This increases our cost as a rate of sales, but without this investment, the shopping experience, an important element of our Customer 1st Strategy, would be negatively affected. The transition from inflation to deflation creates a difficult operating environment. We estimate that we had deflation without pharmacy of 1.25%, including 1.5% deflation in the grocery category. I want to stress that we've been through economic environments like this before.  In 2009, we transitioned from inflation to deflation in a very similar way. Of course, in 2009, we also had a much more difficult macroeconomic backdrop. Even though the current environment is volatile, we are confident that we will navigate today's challenges and continue to deliver value for our customers and shareholders.  While we've revised our identical supermarket sales growth and net earnings per diluted share guidance for the year, our growth objectives are on a 3- to 5-year rolling cycle, and we remain confident in those targets. We are in this long-term range run and not a 12-week cycle or particular year. We have demonstrated our ability to invest at the appropriate times to create momentum when the environment improves.  While we expect continued deflation and tough year-over-year comparisons for the remainder of the year and even into early next year, as we know from past experience, the environment won't be deflationary forever. Kroger's long-term focus is one of the reasons why our business continues to generate healthy free cash flow, which allow us to invest for the future and maintain financial flexibility to create shareholder value.  To this end, we have decided to allocate approximately $500 million less to capital investments for 2016 and for 2017, which will allow us the flexibility to return value in the near term.  This could include utilizing our current board-authorized $500 million share repurchase authority as market conditions provide the opportunity.  We often say that the only certain thing in retail is that it is always changing. This is certainly true for an ever-shifting customer preferences as well as the overall competitive environment. We believe one of the reasons for our continued success, regardless of the operating conditions or competition, is our ability to generate increasingly sophisticated customer insights.  Our team at 84.51\u00b0 helps us figure out what customers want so we can provide highly informed strategic investments based on rigorous data analytics rather than simply reacting to competitors. Customer insights give us a big advantage in challenging environments like this one.  A lot of what we are seeing suggests a gradual tightening of budgets. Our customers tell us they are less confident about the economy now than they were 3 months ago, and they expect the economy to get worse in the next 3 months. We are as committed as ever to doing what is right for the customer.  Our team's execution of our Customer 1st Strategy helped deliver growth in loyal and total households, units and market share compared to last year. Customers continue to vote with their dollar, and on that basis, Kroger continues to win.  We believe that it is easier to steer a big ship when the waters are smooth. But when the water gets rough, the right people and the right strategy make all the difference. These are some of the same reasons why you should continue to believe in Kroger.  We are focused on the long term. We have the financial flexibility to execute our strategy, and we have the right people and the right strategy to weather any storm. Our merchandisers and operators are the best in the business. Our senior management team brings a great mix of new ideas and long tenure, propelling innovation while remaining steady at the helm. Like any of the high-performance teams, the mindset of our leaders is agility and responsiveness to changing customer and economic dynamics. We remain focused on growing market share, and we'll continue to invest in our associates and our business, providing value to our customers, both today and for the future.  One example of our long-term focus is our recent merger between our specialty drug pharmacy, Axiom, and ModernHEALTH. The merger, which closed last Friday, further expands our presence in the high-growth specialty pharmacy area and connects nicely with our retail pharmacies and broader health and wellness strategy. We are excited to welcome ModernHEALTH's 500 associates to the Kroger family. A second example of a long -- of our long-term focus is our progress integrating sustainable practices into our business operations. We believe that customers and associates increasingly make decisions based on how well companies take care of their people, their communities and the planet. So we are very pleased to share that Kroger has earned a spot on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the fourth consecutive year. More than 600 companies in North America are evaluated each year, and only the top 20% are listed on the index. This recognition, of course, is only possible thanks to the thousands of individual activities our associates do on a daily basis in our stores, manufacturing and distribution facilities and offices. Through all our growth initiatives, we strive for balance between our core business, beyond the core and innovation. This fundamental approach is how we'll continue to win with customers and create sustainable long-term value for shareholders.  I noted earlier that we operate our business on a 3- to 5-year rolling cycle. Over both time horizons, we have been performing consistently above our long-term net earnings per diluted share growth guidance of 8% to 11%, plus a growing dividend.  Now Mike will offer more detail on Kroger's second quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for the remainder of the year. Mike? J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. As Rodney said, we've been through periods like this before, and we have the leaders and the strategy to continue delivering value to our customers, associates and shareholders. While the quarter and the year aren't shaping up the way we expected, we continue to be well positioned for the long term.  We continue to see a strong flow of capital projects. We've tried to be very clear about our deliberate ramp-up of capital spending since 2012. As the management team, we recognize the environment and believe it is prudent to reduce capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion for 2016 and 2017. This is still a substantial investment in the business.  Consistent with our long-term financial strategy, we're maintaining flexibility with our cash flow to invest in the business, repurchase shares and maintain a growing dividend. Our philosophy is to always create value for shareholders. And while our Customer 1st approach remains our distinctive business strategy, we implement multiple approaches to deliver shareholder value.  There are many gives and takes in any quarter and year, and we view our ability to adjust to return value to shareholders as the core strength of our financial strategy.  Identical supermarket sales without fuel came in at 1.7%, impacted by deflation across most departments, with the exception of produce and pharmacy. We are seeing significant deflation in milk, eggs and cheese. We will continue to focus on growing households, growing units and making sure we are delivering the right value proposition for our customers. As Rodney pointed out, we continue to do all 3 of these things during the second quarter. That our team accomplished this in such a deflationary environment is no small feat and demonstrates that our associates continue to connect with customers in a personal and meaningful way.  As you know, a strength of our Customer 1st model is that we make regular investments in our people, products, shopping experience and price. As Rodney said, we added hours to keep up with unit growth, and we also continued our price investments as evidenced by our lower gross margin. We balance these investments based on the needs we see in the business to drive sustainable results over time. Operating costs, excluding fuel, Roundy's and the pension agreements, were better by 6 basis points in the second quarter. A lower expected bonus is one driver of these results. We'll continue to focus on cost controls and use those savings to provide additional value to customers.  Now for an update on retail fuel. In the second quarter, the average retail price of a gallon of gas declined by $0.47 compared to last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.198 compared to $0.19 in the same quarter last year. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, we are at $0.184 this year compared to $0.186 last year. We expect this rolling 4-quarter comparison to further decline as we cycle some very strong margins for the rest of the year.  A variety of factors contributed to our net earnings per diluted share results in the second quarter. Deflation was clearly a headwind, and that was offset by a lower-than-expected affected income tax rate due to the adoption of a new accounting standard. Our second quarter net earnings per diluted share on a GAAP basis was $0.40 compared to $0.44 during the same period last year. Our net earnings per diluted share results included charges related to the restructuring of certain pension obligations to help stabilize associates' future benefits. Excluding the effects of these charges, Kroger's adjusted net earnings were $454 million or $0.47 per diluted share.  Our integration with Roundy's continues to be on plan. We have 2 dedicated management teams, one for Roundy's in Wisconsin and one for Mariano's in Illinois, to take into account the uniqueness of the formats in each location. These leadership teams have a mix of Kroger and Roundy's experience. We are pleased with the early results of our Roundy's investments in Wisconsin, and we remain excited about this opportunity.  During the second quarter, corporate brands represented approximately 27% of total units sold and 26% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy. Our corporate brands team continues to drive innovation in important categories.  Earlier this week, we launched a new, more affordable corporate brand line of cage-free eggs. As you may know that earlier this year, we committed to a 100% cage-free eggs supply chain by 2025. In order to reach that goal, we want to help customers shift from conventional eggs to the cage-free category. By offering a lower-price alternative to most other cage-free eggs on the market today, we believe our mainstream customers will begin to migrate to the cage-free category.  Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.11 compared to 2.02 during the second -- the same period last year. This result illustrates our commitment to use free cash flow to both grow our business and return cash to shareholders while maintaining an appropriate level of leverage for our credit rating. Over time, we would expect our net total debt to EBITDA ratio to grow if we continue to successfully negotiate restructuring of troubled multiemployer pension plan obligations to help stabilize associates' future benefits. We would not expect this increase to adversely affect our credit rating as the rating agencies already contemplate our multiemployer pension plan obligations, and the additional debt we would take on to fund these plans will be offset in a reduction of our off-balance sheet multiemployer pension plan obligations.  Over the last year, Kroger's used free cash flow to repurchase $1.1 billion of common shares, pay $406 million in dividends, invest $3.8 billion in capital and merge with Roundy's for $866 million. Return on invested capital for the second quarter was 13.95%, excluding Roundy's, compared to 14.24% for the second quarter of 2015. Our balance sheet is as strong as ever. I will now provide a brief update on labor relations. We recently agreed to new contracts covering store associates in Little Rock, Nashville and Southern California. We are currently negotiating contracts with the UFCW for Fry's associates in Arizona and store associates in Michigan and Atlanta. We also negotiated a new contract with the Teamsters for our Roundy's distribution center.  Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger and the local unions, which represent many of our associates, have a shared objective, growing Kroger's business and profitably, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.  I'd like to take a moment to highlight our $111 million commitment to the UFCW consolidated pension plan. This is part of an agreement to transfer the liabilities of 2 troubled multiemployer pension plans, which protects pensions already earned and will provide greater stability for future benefits of more than 6,500 Kroger associates and retirees. This is the latest in a series of steps we've taken during the last 4 years to provide greater stability of current and future benefits for Kroger associates and enhance the prospects for future returns while continuing to deliver strong shareholder value. In 2012, we agreed to establish the UFCW consolidated pension plan by working with the unions to consolidate 4 multiemployer pension funds into one. That agreement protected benefits -- that agreement protected earned benefits and provide a greater stability of the future benefits of more than 65,000 Kroger associates.  In 2014, we announced similar agreements with 2 additional multiemployer pension funds. And in 2015, we accelerated contributions to the consolidated plan. We are proud of our ability to do this even in a tough operating environment. We intend to continue looking for opportunities to leverage our strong financial flexibility to safeguard associates' benefits, increase certainty and control over future benefit obligations and continuing to deliver strong shareholder value.  Turning now to our 2016 guidance. As a result of continued deflation, we lowered our net earnings guidance to a range of $2.03 to $2.13 per diluted share for 2016. Kroger's adjusted net earnings guidance range per share -- per diluted share for 2016 is $2.10 to $2.20, which excludes the $0.07 charge from the company's commitment to restructure certain pension obligations. The previous guidance range was $2.19 to $2.28, which did not anticipate the $0.07 charge from the company's commitment to restructure the pension obligations. Shareholder return will be enhanced by a dividend that is expected to increase over time. For identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, we expect the remainder of 2016 to be in the 50 basis point to 1.5% range, which is 1.4% to 1.8% for the full year. Finally, we now expect Kroger's full year FIFO operating margin in 2016, excluding fuel, to decline slightly compared to 2015 results.  Now I will turn it back to Rodney. W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike. We are in this for the long term whether it is our sustainability initiatives, job creation or return to shareholders. None of these are short-term ventures or quick fixes. We've been through business cycles like this before, and we know the best and right thing to do is to deliver on our promise today while investing for the future.  We are as committed as ever to our Customer 1st Strategy, and we are confident that we will continue to deliver long-term value for shareholders. Now we look forward to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : So maybe you can talk about how you guys -- and obviously you've got a lot of data, how you think about the analytics around price elasticity in a deflationary environment versus inflationary, right, in trying to get a decent, at least short-term ROIC. And then -- and contrast that with maybe what you're seeing in the marketplace competitively. Because it always struck me that, right, when you have a deflationary environment and your costs are going down, people can be a little more irrational and make poor decisions, right, because their COGS are going down. So curious how you look at that and what you're seeing from your competition. W. McMullen: Well, the -- thanks. The -- it's a great question, and it's a little hard to answer because each category would be a little different. And if you look at some of the beef and pork categories, people are moving back into those categories in a very, very strong way, and we have incredible tonnage growth in those areas. So the elasticity, you have tons. Other categories where people kind of buy what they need all the time anyway, you don't see as much. So if you think about eggs, for an example, people only eat a certain number of eggs. But some of the other categories would be a little different. The other thing that's always hard is getting your message out because -- it's fascinating. In our research, most people are saying their basket of goods cost more money, but we, in fact, know that it isn't. So helping the customer see that is always a challenge for us and our competitors as well. Go ahead, John. John Heinbockel : No, that's good. W. McMullen: And when you look at the competition, it's kind of the same as what we've always had in each -- one of the -- what do they say in each short statement in economics is wrong because if you look across the country, you have competitors doing all kinds of different things depending on what's going on in their business and what's going on in that part of the country. So there really isn't a consistency to it that I would say it's completely different today than before. John Heinbockel : Yes. Well, good, as a follow-up, because you guys always talked about -- you felt competition has not changed. It was rigorous but not irrational. I mean, it just looks like there are pockets of irrationality. And I wondered, is that true? And particularly in protein, is that made worse in the Memorial Day to Labor Day time period because that's kind of prime beef season? And then so post Labor Day, that should calm down or no? W. McMullen: The -- I guess, I'm a little -- I wouldn't be quite as aggressive on saying people are being irrational because I don't see anything that is different today than when you go back and look at it over the last year or 3 years or 5 years. And you always have certain pockets where people are doing something different than overall. I'm just trying to think from a Labor Day standpoint and some of the ads, I wouldn't say that there was something drastically different than what... J. Schlotman: So like the holiday ad. W. McMullen: Yes. And you're going to put in the ad the things that the customers want for that period of time. And to your comment, certainly, people grill out a lot more on that weekend just because it's kind of the last major weekend of summer. Operator : The next question will come from Edward Kelly of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Edward Kelly : So Rodney, I just wanted to follow-up on John's question because there has been, I guess, a fair amount of talk now from, I guess, food retailing competitors about conventional grocery stores getting much more aggressive from a promotional standpoint. We -- there's also been plenty of talk about Walmart being more aggressive within the marketplace as well. You're kind of suggesting that you don't see as much of that. So I'm just wondering where that disconnect maybe would come from. And then as part of all that, could you just talk about what you are seeing so far in your third quarter, both from the perspective of your ID growth and the general promotional cadence of your business? W. McMullen: Well, if you look at competitors, the thing that you really have to look at is you have to look at across the whole country. You can't just look at one particular area. So to say that there's something drastically different, I wouldn't define it as that. As you know, we have a basket of goods that we look at on almost a weekly basis in terms of how is our pricing relative to our strategy and relative to our competition. And we really haven't seen drastic changes in that relative pricing in those basket of goods, and we haven't for a long period of time. The other thing, I think it's always incredibly important for us to remember, and this is as much inside the company as external, is the customer decides where to shop, and price is only one element of that decision on where to price. They also look at the fresh -- the quality of the fresh departments. What are the products that are being offered, what's the variety there. And then a really critical part is how do the associates engage and how are they treated and how long does it take to -- when you're in line and those elements. And we continue to make great progress on those elements, and our customers continue to tell us it's really important for them as they decide where to shop. And that's -- as you know, years ago, that's the reason we started the Customer 1st Strategy. It's also the reason why we continue to execute the Customer 1st Strategy. If you look at what's within it, though, it has changed over time as customers change. So if you look at natural and organics, when we started the journey, natural and organics really wasn't a critical part of the product strategy. Today, it's incredibly important. And I don't know, Mike, it's probably, what, 10% or a little over 10% of our business when you look at it in total. J. Schlotman: Yes, definitely over 10%. W. McMullen: So those are -- elements, I think, are equally important. When you look at where we are so far in the third quarter, obviously, we're early in the quarter. We would be at the low end of the range on identical sales growth, but we're still very early in the quarter. Edward Kelly : I think it's -- right, let me ask a question... J. Schlotman: And also keep in mind, the third quarter is a tough compare for us with the -- in the face of deflationary pressures on the top line. It was a mid-5s quarter last year in the third quarter. So combination of a very strong ID sales quarter last year and deflation last year is certainly a factor on where we are and where we'll wind up. Edward Kelly : Let me just ask the question maybe a different way. Like if we look back at the last period of meaningful deflation, it was obviously a tough period for the industry from a promotional standpoint. If I look at your guidance, it seems to imply there is probably not much deterioration in the gross margin baked in. We sort of look at your numbers historically over a long period of time. I don't think I've ever seen ID growth as low as it's now going to be in the back half of the year without seeing that. We're hearing sort of pockets of more aggressive promotions. I guess, what I'm really trying to understand, Rodney, is why this period is going to be different, why the movie that we saw in 2009 doesn't play out the same way. Because I think just from looking at your numbers and what I'm hearing from you, that's what you're anticipating. W. McMullen: Yes. And when you look at from most of the elements we can see at this moment, we would expect it to look pretty similar to '09. If you look at back in '09, the identicals would be similar. I think we were at 1.3% and 1.8% or something like that. I don't remember for sure. J. Schlotman: 1.3% and 1.2% in the third and fourth quarter. W. McMullen: Yes. So both of those would be within the range where we've given for the balance of the year. We would certainly expect -- typically, you do see a little bit more promotional activity early in inflation cycles just because the competitors think they're losing share versus it's a fact that it's deflation. And we would certainly include some of those elements in terms of where we expected things to be for the balance of the year. But everything that we can see, '09 would be the most similar. And if you look at '09, there were 3 quarters of deflation. If you go back and actually look at 2002, there were 4 quarters of deflation. So those are kind of the points that we're using for references. Operator : And the next question is from Shane Higgins of Deutsche Bank. Shane Higgins : And actually, just following a little bit on Ed's question. The deflation that we're seeing today, do you think we're really in a similar situation as in 2009? I mean, at that time, I recall we were cycling some pretty high inflation in '08. That's not really the situation today. Just inflation wasn't very high last year. The economy today is expanding, albeit slowly. So this environment does feel a little bit different. I mean, do you think if we stay in a more sustained deflationary environment that the promotional environment could intensify from here? I don't know, any thoughts you guys have on that would be great. W. McMullen: Yes, it's kind of fascinating, your question. I mean, if you look at over the last 8 or 9 years, if you look at inflation on a rolling 5-year basis, the range is 2% to 3% on a rolling 5 years. Now if you look at it in terms of swings, we had deflation of basically 1% or so, and this includes pharmacy, I should add, up to inflation of 6%. And the high inflation actually happened, as you referenced, in '08, and it also happened in '11. So to say that it's different this time, I mean, each one of us would have our own opinions. An awful lot of deflation/inflation is driven by what's going on in commodity markets, and most of the commodity markets are incredibly benign at the moment. And historically, I always like to say high prices solve high prices and low prices solve low prices because capacity will start changing. And if you look at farmers, they're very smart, and they'll start producing less of the things that -- where they don't make money. So historically, that's what caused inflations to swing. And still an awful lot of our business is driven by the commodity markets. If you look at produce, that's just going to be driven by what's the growing season and what's the growing season like. We continue to see good demand. We still continue to see tonnage growth and those elements, and those are the things that we're looking at to see do we think it's different this time. Shane Higgins : All right. And then just a quick follow-up. I mean, given that you guys have such a strong private-label portfolio, I believe, Rodney, you said it was 27% of units during the quarter. Does this give you guys some additional flexibility in periods of inflation and deflation in terms of maybe being able to pass along some of the lower costs more quickly? Any color that you guys could give there will be great. W. McMullen: Yes. I'm going to broaden your question a little bit, Shane. For us, corporate brands is a huge, important critical part of our strategy and a very important competitive advantage. And it starts with what products are we offering and what's the quality of those products and the value for those products. We find it always an advantage from a competitive standpoint because if national brands do something that's noneconomic, our corporate brands pick up share. So we find them -- our customers love them, and they vote by buying a lot of them. We also find that it's way of keeping the market honest. We certainly would have an advantage in terms of understanding the true economic cost to produce something, and retail pricing would be based on that true economic cost. Shane Higgins : And then actually just like -- I'd like to squeeze just one more in. Are you guys working pretty closely with your vendor partners in this period to try to -- since you guys understand the cost so well to try to get the best prices? And how are those conversations going? W. McMullen: Yes, always. And as you know, we always look at the CPG companies as partners. And I obviously go to quite a few meetings where the CPG partners and Kroger meet. And a lot of times, it's hard to figure out who works for who, which I view as a positive. Both of us are trying to drive volume and trying to drive profitability, and most of the CPG teams have a responsibility for part of our profit as well. So I don't see those discussions changing. There are healthy respect, but there are also healthy negotiations that go on. And I don't sense a change in that basic approach. And the other thing that we always feel that we are able to provide the best insights for CPG companies on introducing new items, what's the success, what customers are buying, and we try to work with those partners to grow their business as well. Operator : And next, we have a question from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : So I just want to go back to your comments, Rodney, on the U.S. consumer. It sounded more down -- deep to me versus prior quarters. Just want to get a sense, if you look at your business, are you actually seeing consumers pull back on discretionary spending? Or is that just based on the surveys that you move the consumers more cautious? W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at the areas that we would consider discretionary like high-value wine, Boar's Head, Starbucks, Murray's Cheese, all of those areas, they continue to have nice growth. The comments I made are more based on the surveys that we -- where we survey customers almost every day and the changes in terms of what the customers tell us they anticipate will happen. Rupesh Parikh : Okay, great. And then switching topics to inflation, deflation. What are you building in for the balance of the year on the deflation front? And is it fair to say that at this point, you're assuming that deflation will continue through at least the early part of next year? J. Schlotman: Yes. We did not provide a point estimate or a range in our 8-K that we filed this morning. We only talked about the fact that we expect to see product cost deflation for the balance of the year. And as Rodney said, it could extend into early next year as well in his prepared comments. Rupesh Parikh : Okay, great. I'm going to sneak in one last one. From a tonnage perspective, has your tonnage growth been consistent with prior quarters? Or has it -- or did you see any change this period? J. Schlotman: We continue to be very pleased with our tonnage growth. It's positive. There's a lot of things that go on inside tonnage growth. There's mixed pack changes. There are certain categories where we've gone to multipack units, bigger selling units of multiple items in the same package. We continue to be very, very bullish about our ability to grow tonnage. Rather, we try to avoid giving an exact measure because it's much as an art as a science, but it's something we're fundamentally focused on. We had nice tonnage growth, and we continue to have market share growth in the quarter as well. Operator : The next question is from Stephen Tanal of Goldman Sachs. Stephen Tanal : Just to follow-up on that last question a little bit. So the data that we're looking at, I guess, would suggest that input cost deflation should be moderating a bit into the back half. Do you think that, that's accurate or at all? And how do you see the retail side of this playing out from here? Do you have any expectations for how long this typically -- this kind of thing typically would last? W. McMullen: Well, if you'd look at how long it lasts, the only insight that I could provide is the comment I made a little earlier. If you go back and look at 2009, it was 3 quarters. If you go back to 2002, it was 4 quarters. We've had inflation every quarter other than those since the first quarter of 2002 as how far back we went. On terms of moderating, as you get toward the latter part of the year and early next year, you're starting to cycle the deflation. So I would -- certainly, we would guess that it would start to moderate just because you're starting to cycle some of the deflation. And an awful lot of the deflation is driven because of commodity pricing. And that would be the reason why -- that we would believe that it would start moderating. And then when you start cycling, it was -- we don't expect it to be negative on top of negative for a long period of time. Stephen Tanal : Got it. Okay, that makes sense. Now is that at all part of sort of the guide here? As you say, you're sort of tracking toward the lower end of the back half guide. Or do you -- would you say that, that dynamic reflects your expectation of improvement in retail? Or would you say it's more about the compare? How would you describe that? W. McMullen: Yes, why don't you say it... J. Schlotman: There's a little distraction here in the room. W. McMullen: Yes. Stephen, if you don't mind asking the question again because all of a sudden, we had extra voice in the room. Stephen Tanal : Yes, of course. The guidance for IDs, being at the low end now versus obviously a bit of a higher range or a higher midpoint, is that more reflective of your expectation of improvement in retail prices or more about just the compares from a year ago? W. McMullen: I would certainly say a big piece of that is the compare to last year. Last year, in the third quarter, we had 5.4% ID sales. So when you look at the deflation we've had since then compared to that compare, it's really a little bit of a compounding effect as we begin the third quarter here. Keep in mind, last year's fourth quarter was 3.7% IDs, so the compare starts to moderate a little bit as well. And that just -- it's the range we feel that, at this point, where we think we would wind up in. Stephen Tanal : Great. And if I could just sneak one last one in. If you could comment on the health and wellness side. Obviously, with Axiom dead, it seems like you do have some interest in the pharmacy business. Any thoughts on that business, building it out maybe longer term? W. McMullen: Well, it's certainly -- when you look at the total health and wellness strategy, we are very excited about the opportunities there. Obviously, all of us baby boomers keep getting older and the new generations as well, and it creates higher demand for pharmaceuticals and other things. So it's an area that we like. It's an area where we believe we have a unique competitive advantage just because we can start helping customers eat healthier as well, and that's something that's a positive in terms of the overall connection with the customer. And when you look at all the pieces together, we think it's a great opportunity to create sum of all parts where a customer can engage with us in a physical facility, online or through the specialty drug channel and then we can leverage across and then the Little Clinic helps as well. So we really get excited about the opportunities. And the other thing that we really like is that customer is very loyal as well. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Kenneth Goldman : A couple of quick clarification questions. The statement about quarter-to-date comps being at a lower end of the range, was that the annual range or the back half range? W. McMullen: It's the back half range. And remember Mike's comment about as you go to this -- first of all, we're cycling incredibly strong identicals a year ago, and then as you get to the fourth quarter, you start cycling identicals that were lower than where they were in the third quarter. I don't know, Mike, anything you're going to add? J. Schlotman: I would agree with that. Kenneth Goldman : Okay. And my other clarification, there were a few deflation numbers that were mentioned this morning. I just wanted to make sure we're on the same page with those. I think what you said, and correct me if I'm wrong, total company deflation was minus 1%. Total deflation x pharma was minus about 1.25% and perishable deflation was minus 1.5%. Do I have those right? J. Schlotman: So yes, a little less than 1%, including pharmacy; 1.25%, excluding pharmacy; and grocery was about 1.5% negative. W. McMullen: And that's grocery only. That's the way we define grocery. J. Schlotman: Which includes the dairy complex. Not everybody has the dairy complex in grocery, but we do. Kenneth Goldman : Okay. I had heard that can be perishables. I think it was grocery. One quick one here. Sprouts said this week, and if you addressed this, forgive me, but most of the more extreme pricing actions they're seeing in the marketplace were promo driven, not really list price reductions. Do you agree with that? And if so, is that one of the reasons you have hope that maybe some of the irrationality you're seeing out there will be short lived? J. Schlotman: Well, we see a little bit of everything out there. And as Rodney said a few minutes ago, our -- over the breadth of the geographies we have, you see a variety of everything. You see people in certain -- even if they're a broad-based retailer, you see them doing things in one geography and not other geographies, and then you see regionals doing particular things in and out of different promotions and then other people continuing to make investments in price. And we did a little bit of all those as well. We put out a circular, sometimes weekly, sometimes for a couple of weeks, and we continue to invest in everyday price as well, so it's really no different. I think the thing to keep in mind is, we don't always necessarily just react to what particular competitors are doing with our relationship with 84.51\u00b0. We put significantly more science behind how and when we make price investments, whether it's promotional activity or a permanent price reduction. Operator : And next, we have Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley. Vincent Sinisi : Just going back to the comments from the macro perspective, first, on the consumer with the surveys. Wondering if you're seeing anything different kind of sequentially in terms of SNAP that's being used in the stores or in terms of the items in the basket. And then secondly, just on the competitive commentary that you gave, understand that varies by geography. But just wondering just kind of if -- overall, are you seeing some of the heavier pockets of competition coming from particular segments of the market, whether that be more of the larger conventionals, the big boxes or some of the smaller regionals discount, that type of thing? W. McMullen: When you look at the surveys overall, first of all, SNAP continues to decline and it has for the last -- I'm going off of memory, and then Mike, if you remember the exact number, but I want to say like 1.5 years or so that it's been declining. J. Schlotman: That's about right. W. McMullen: Some of the decline is driven because of changes in terms of what is in SNAP in terms of programs that get renewed or don't get renewed. If you look at the items in the basket, that's always a tough one to answer because if you look at the items in the basket, we've been flat or up slightly or down slightly for a long period of time. The thing that's important to note is if you look at customers over a month, how do they spend with us, and they continue to spend 5 more items from us. And as we get better and better in our fresh departments, customers come in and shop our stores more often because on fresh products, people want to buy it. It's not quite to the European standards where people buy daily, but you'll see people increasingly coming into the store every 2 or 3 days to pick up their fresh items. And that affects the items in the basket. So I think it's always difficult to overlook it, to look too much at items in the basket, and we would focus much more in terms of, over a month, how our customer is behaving. In terms of the competitors, I don't know that there's too much I can add from what I -- Mike and I mentioned before. Overall, I wouldn't say that we're seeing a huge difference. If you go back and look, you have competitors that had gone out of business that now stores have been reopened in some parts of the country. You have all kinds of different things going on. And to make a blanket statement or -- a blanket statement toward a specific competitor, that, I don't think it would be helpful because I really don't see it changing massively when you look at big groups. I don't know, Mike, anything you would want to add to that? J. Schlotman: Yes, I would agree with you. Vincent Sinisi : Okay. No, that's helpful. And if I could slide one more fast one in here. Just with the kind of the next 2 years or so of annual CapEx kind of getting back to that sub $400 million mark, just any other color that you can give us all in terms of where versus what you have been planning when it was over the $400 million range, kind of where some differences may lie? J. Schlotman: Well, we've obviously done a lot of work at this point in the year to pare back capital spending in the current fiscal year because you have projects in the pipeline. There are certain projects that will slide into the next fiscal year and then projects from '17 that will slide into '18 probably. And I'll remind you that our -- a few of the $500 million reduction is for this year and next year -- well, [ph] for this year and then keeping the next year in the same range as this year. We just think it's prudent in this environment to maintain and increase our financial flexibility to respond to the environment that's out there and to have that incremental cash to be able to spend. Our view is there will always be a significant number of projects in the pipeline, and we're comfortable we're going to be able to do the projects we have the highest level of confidence in and get those built while maintaining as much financial flexibility as we can. It's not concentrated in any one geography, particularly this year. Frankly, some of it was where did we have stores we're not legally committed to open or start projects on, and we feel very good about -- that level of spending will still be a record year for spending. So it's not -- and it's a very substantial investment in the business. W. McMullen: The biggest effect will probably be in terms of net new stores. If you just make blanket statements in terms of where will it -- but it'll be a little of everything, but that's probably the biggest bucket. J. Schlotman: I would agree with that. Operator : And the next question comes from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : So I'm kind of just sitting back and listening to the call and trying to compared it to what we're seeing out in the marketplace and there's definitely just a little bit of a disconnect. I mean, you have your biggest competitor, Walmart, that's on the record. They were just at the Goldman Sachs conference, and I'm sure you guys see the research. I mean, they're clearly moving on price in certain geographies and have said that they are going to continue to do that. And we can also see the market share moving pretty quickly towards them. Then we saw Albertsons, your second biggest competitor, lowering price pretty aggressively, not all geographies but in several of yours. But you guys say you don't see anything different. So I mean, are you hoping they just don't keep coming at you? I mean, we do see your comps now at about 0.5%, and it seems like the market share has -- your market share gains have ebbed. So I'm just trying to understand the strategy a little bit better. W. McMullen: Well, if you look at our market -- we continue to gain market share in the second quarter. The -- if you look at it from a competitive standpoint, our second biggest competitor would actually be somebody other than Albertsons. I don't remember which -- where Albertsons is right now, but Costco would be the second-largest competitor. The -- I always think it's important to look across the whole country and what's going on, and I made the comment before about all short statement. All short statements in economics are wrong. And there, you can see behavior, all kinds of different behavior across the country, what competitors are going to do. Your guess is as good as ours would be in terms of whether that's something they're going to do everywhere or if that's something they're testing or -- and what speed does it take for them to do it everywhere. I don't know, Mike, anything you'd want to add? J. Schlotman: I agree. And just keep in mind, when you think about what competitors are doing, it's not like our prices have remained stable or increased. We continue to invest in price as well. Scott Mushkin : So I mean, I guess, last quarter, I asked Rodney that -- if Walmart did follow through, what would you do? Would you continue to keep your gap where it's gone, which is lower? It's been lower over the last several years, it's pretty narrow in the mid-single digits in a lot of markets, not every market. It seems like now, you're -- seem okay at least in certain markets with that gap to move up maybe back into the mid-teens, and I'm just again, I would push on why. W. McMullen: I would challenge your comment because first of all, we would not publicly say what we're going to do from a competitive standpoint in advance of doing it because I think the FTC would probably get a little upset with us along with, I know, our general counsel would be. And I did not say that we would be comfortable with any specific number, and you were the -- and you gave the specific numbers that you speculate what that is. I would go back to the comments that Mike and I made before. We continue to execute our strategy. There's parts of the strategy that's more important than just price. It really is everything all together. To say, to react to specific comments, I think, would be very difficult. And how you look at a basket of goods may be different than how a customer looks at a basket of goods as well. J. Schlotman: One of the other things that continues to fascinate me with all the conversation about investing in price or not investing in price, 18 months ago, all the questions I was getting is, why do you guys continue to invest in price, why don't you let your gross margins go up? You've closed the gap everywhere, now you can reap the benefits of what you've sown. And we've staunchly said for years we're going to continue to invest in price because if you look at any segment of retailing, over any period of time, gross margins always decline, and we'll continue to maintain our financial flexibility and execute our Customer 1st Strategy of investing not only in price, but the 3 other elements of it as well. Scott Mushkin : And then just one last quick one. Are you guys happy with where your market share gains are so far in the third quarter? And then I'll yield. W. McMullen: Well, the -- looking at market share gains, I don't think it's -- the data isn't quick enough to be able to answer where we are so far in the third quarter on market share gains. And I actually couldn't answer the question because we wouldn't have the data yet from the market. And we look at market share by looking at Nielsen data, IRI data and other sources. Operator : And the next question is from Robby Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Robert Ohmes : I apologize ahead of time. I'm going to ask for a couple of quick clarifications. I hope you answer them. On the deflation, can you give us some insight on -- I get the meat deflation and the commodity-driven deflation. But can you give us some insight -- as you roll from the first quarter and into the second quarter, did the deflation spread out significantly in the center of store? And are you seeing and expecting deflation in sort of the CPG-driven part of your business? That's one clarification I'm looking for. J. Schlotman: It certainly did pick up in the grocery category in the second quarter as far as more deflation. The other thing that's happened, and I said this actually earlier today when I was on CNBC, if you look at produce, it wasn't deflationary in the quarter, but it was -- there was disinflation in produce in the second quarter. So it was less inflationary in the second quarter than the first quarter, so we were -- it's fairly broad-based. W. McMullen: Yes, but if you look within grocery, it's heavily driven by the dairy category, which is obviously mostly milk. Eggs is a huge part of that. So if you look at the acceleration, it's really being driven by a few select items within it. J. Schlotman: Fair point. Robert Ohmes : And then my second clarification is if you look at the natural organic category within your store, whether it's looking at it at Simple Truth or looking at the natural organic brands that you've now been carrying for a while, is natural organic deflating right now? W. McMullen: It would only be in terms of the areas that are commodity driven. So if you look at eggs, eggs is kind of fascinating because there wasn't as much inflation a year ago in eggs that were organic eggs. So the deflation there isn't as much. It's because they didn't inflate as much. Milk would be a little bit. But if you look at the alternatives in terms of grain-based milks, really not so much there. I don't know, Mike, any... J. Schlotman: I agree with you. Robert Ohmes : That's great. And just last one, not a deflation question. Can you give us a sense of Simple Truth momentum in penetration and remind us where that's at? J. Schlotman: Yes, we continue to be thrilled with Simple Truth. It continues to grow as a brand. More and more households continue to enter into the category and stay in the category. Our corporate brand folks continue to do a great job of expanding the category with incremental products in the category as well. It's really the cornerstone of our natural and organic program. W. McMullen: And it would continue to be growing at close to double digits, especially if you don't include chicken because there's quite a bit of deflation in chicken right now. Operator : And the next question will come from Alvin Concepcion of Citi. Alvin Concepcion : Just in regards to your 8% to 11% long-term earnings guidance, would you expect a return to that range in 2017? And the follow-up to that is, what gives you comfort in that level of earnings growth, especially since many folks are worried that the promotional environment will intensify down the road? W. McMullen: I wouldn't feel comfortable telling you the specific time until we give 2017 guidance. So -- and I don't want to think we want to go ahead and give '17 guidance now. And we really look at it over a rolling 3-  to 5-year period of time. And if you look at it historically, we've actually grown in -- well in excess of the 11% over a 3-year period of time and a 5-year period of time, both on the quarter and the annual basis. So it really is -- when you look at the overall ability to connect with the customers, that's why we feel comfortable with that 8% to 11%. We still see tremendous opportunities to improve the way we connect with customers and the way we run our business. And you guys hear me say often that our to-do list remains bigger than our done list, and that certainly remains the case. And that's the reason why we remain confident in the 8% to 11% plus a dividend that's increasing over time, is that we still see plenty of opportunities to grow the business, connect with the customer in a deeper way and to continue to run our business better. And it's one of the things that's exciting every time you figure out something that you could do better and you do it, it helps you learn how to do something else better. So that's the reason why we get excited. At this point, I wouldn't feel comfortable to give you the specific period of time and obviously, at some point, we'll give some guidance on '17, but it's really too early at this point. Alvin Concepcion : Great. Just a couple of quick clarifications as well. On the taxes, the employee share-based payment, is that a onetime thing? I mean, should we expect the 35% tax rate going forward into '17? J. Schlotman: Yes. It's purely driven by how many stock options wind up getting exercised in any time frame and a reclassification from an accounting standpoint where the benefit of that goes in the financial statements. Alvin Concepcion : Great. And last one for me. Just you've given guidance on fuel gross margins in the past. I think you've previously said it would be at or below the 5-year average. Is that still your view for this year? J. Schlotman: Our view for the rest of the year is it will continue to -- on a rolling 4 quarters basis, it will continue to trend down from where we finish the quarter, and I wouldn't see that expectation any different. We had a very, very strong fuel quarter last year. It's actually held up better so far this year than we thought. We finished the rolling 4 quarters at the end of the second quarter at $0.184. That was down $0.002 from last year. We would expect that downward trend to continue a little. W. McMullen: Thanks, Alvin. Before we end today's call, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today.  I want to thank the many associates sharing in the Kroger journey. We have 6 generations working with us today. Each associate makes a unique contribution. You bring your energy and ideas, your experiences and expertise. We are a better company because you've made Kroger the place where you want to be and work.  Even as we've grown and gotten bigger as a company, I know that when the doors open and the lights go on at our stores, offices, distribution centers and manufacturing facilities, everyone is giving their best to our customers, our company and each other. That means a lot and that will make all the difference.  Thank you for everything that you do for our customers every day. That completes our call today. Thanks for joining. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mike Schlotman, Executive Vice President and CFO. Please go ahead. J. Schlotman: Thanks. Kate couldn't be with us here this morning, so I will wish you the good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our third quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. W. McMullen: Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. To start, I want to say how -- that I'm proud of our associates for their continuing objective in connecting with our customers in a very difficult operating environment. Their efforts helped us grow both total households and loyal households during the third quarter. As expected, deflation persisted during the third quarter. And as we've said before, transition periods create a difficult operating environment. This is the third time we've had deflation in 30 years. And in previous instances, deflation lasted from 3 to 5 quarters in a row. We're in a middle -- in the middle of the cycle right now, and it's not fun. Still, our tonnage continues to grow. Our total market share continues to expand, and we're focused on executing our strategy. A silver lining of deflationary environments is that it reveals to us how we can run our business better by shining a light on areas we can improve. It is really tough when you're in it, but we'll be in a position to benefit from changes we're making today once we're out of this cycle. We are firmly focused on our long-term strategy of improving our connection with customers and associates and continuing to work on process changes to lower costs. We don't change our strategy based on quarterly swings in results. We remain committed to delivering on our long-term earnings per share growth rate target of 8% to 11%, plus an increasing dividend on a 3- to 5-year time horizon. We will continue to try to win every customer meal by driving our strategy and reacting appropriately to the environment.  Looking at the broader economy and the customer shopping behavior, what we're seeing is mixed. Typically, our data shows our customers' economic concerns mirror what they see in the headlines. For example, health care costs continue to be a worry for customers. Consumer confidence retreated during the quarter, with customers telling us they expect the economy to get worse in the next 3 months. It's important to remember this survey was completed in October, and it's too early to say what the mood of our customers is since then.  Natural, organic and health and wellness continue to be a food megatrend, and we're riding these trends well. Our natural and organic sales continue to outpace total sales growth. Simple Truth continued its strong double-digit growth. Simple Truth organic kombucha is a very -- is very popular as more customers focus on digestive health. We've also recently launched a 24-pack Simple Truth vapor distilled water with electrolytes. It's priced fantastically, it's a great product, and it's selling really well. Our produce, fresh-prepared and deli package departments, sushi, Starbucks, wine and liquor sales all saw comparatively strong growth during the quarter as well. If you can drink it or snack on it, it's selling. A few on-trend examples are protein snacks such as Simple Truth -- Private Selection and Simple Truth paninos, which are imported cured meats wrapped around a creamy cheese as well as handcrafted and real sugar sodas. As I said at our investor conference here in Cincinnati 4 weeks ago, Kroger's earnings growth has outpaced our peers over both the last 5 years and last 10 years, and we still see incredible growth potential as we look forward. We can clearly identify where we have 100 plus billion in market share growth opportunities in our existing markets alone. But good enough today won't be good enough tomorrow. That is why we're both embracing change and accelerating change. For example, 84.51\u00b0 is helping us spot trends and create unique customer experiences to drive growth. We continue to focus on solving customer needs on their terms. We now offer ClickList in more than 550 stores. That is 50 more locations than we were operating just 4 weeks ago. We're connecting with tens of millions of customers digitally, online and through our mobile app. Customers have now downloaded more than 3.5 billion digital offers. We know that the typical customer eats 35 to 45 times per week. Increasingly, we are positioning ourselves to solve for all of those meals or snacks in addition to our historical model of solving for meals at home. We've built a strong Customer 1st foundation over the last 15 years, upon which we can confidently accelerate change. In doing so, we can deliver even better results for our customers, associates and shareholders. Now Mike will offer more details on Kroger's third quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for the fourth quarter and 2017. Mike? J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and once again, good morning, everyone. I want to also thank our associates for their hard work and focus on connecting with customers. As a result, both household and unit growth were up during the quarter as was market share. As we said at the investor conference, the last 2 weeks of the quarter would drive our identical supermarket sales results, and our IDs came in at the low end of our expectations for the quarter. Deflation has not only persisted, but has increased with overall deflation, excluding pharmacy, growing from 1.3% in the second quarter to 1.5% in the third quarter. Additionally, pharmacy inflation declined 130 basis points to 3.3% during the third quarter. Over the last 4 quarters, we have relocated or expanded 49 strong performing stores. This takes them out of our identical supermarket sales calculation. Further, we have opened 42 new stores over the same time frame. Both of these create a headwind to identical food store sales. By way of comparison, last year, there were 19 new stores opened that affected nearby stores. Operating costs, excluding fuel, Roundy's and an $80 million contribution to the UFCW consolidated pension plan in the third quarter of 2015, grew by 19 basis points, of which 15 basis points were related to depreciation due to increases in our capital program. We can clearly do better, and we're redoubling our efforts to reduce these costs as a rate of sales over time. While the environment is difficult, managing operating expenses is something that is in our control. Our Customer 1st strategy is funded by saving costs in areas of the business that customers don't see in order to return value to our customers in the form of lower prices on products that they want, improved service and the shopping experience that makes them want to return. We are and will continue to look at a variety of options to improve processes and lower costs as a rate of sales in a strategic and conscientious way. Now for an update on retail fuel. In the third quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately 17.9 cents compared to 23.8 cents in the same quarter last year. On a rolling 4 quarters basis, we were at $0.17 this year compared to $0.188 last year. During the third quarter, corporate brands represented approximately 28.1% of total units sold and 25.5% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy. As Rodney said earlier, Simple Truth continues to have an impressive growth rate. Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.35 compared to 1.99 during the same period last year. This is a result -- this result is due to the mergers with ModernHEALTH and Roundy's Inc. At year-end, Kroger expects net total debt to adjusted EBITDA to be near the high end of the company's targeted range of 2 to 2.2x. It's worth noting that over a longer-time horizon, we do expect our net total debt to EBITDA ratio to grow if we continually -- if we continue to successfully negotiate restructuring of troubled multiemployer pension plan obligations to help stabilize associates' future benefits, as we did in the second quarter. We would not expect this increase to adversely affect our credit rating, as the rating agencies already factor in our multiemployer pension plan obligations in their evaluations of our credit rating. When we take on additional debt to fund these plans, this reduces the off-balance-sheet amount of our estimated multiemployer pension plan obligations. Over the last 4 quarters, Kroger has used cash to repurchase $1.4 billion in common shares, pay $418 million in dividends, invest $3.8 billion in capital, in line with our commitment to reduce planned capital expenditures for the year, merged with Roundy's for $866 million and merged with ModernHEALTH for approximately $390 million. The flexibility to return value to shareholders is a core strength of our financial strategy. Return on invested capital for the third quarter was 13.63%, excluding Roundy's, compared to 14.16% for the third quarter of 2015. I will now provide a brief update on labor relations. We recently agreed to a new contract with UFCW, covering Fry's associates in Arizona. We are currently negotiating contracts governing store associates in Atlanta, Michigan and North Carolina. And we are also negotiating a new contract with the Teamsters for our Roundy's distribution center. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger continues to communicate with our local unions, which represent many of our associates, the importance of growing Kroger's business and profitability, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.  Turning now to our guidance for the remainder of the year. We narrowed our net earnings guidance to a range of $2.03 to $2.08 per diluted share for 2016. The previous guidance was $2.03 to $2.13. On an adjusted net earnings guidance range per diluted share for the year, it's $2.10 to $2.15, which excludes the $0.07 charge from the company's commitment to restructure certain multiemployer pension plan obligations in the second quarter. The previous adjusted guidance range was $2.10 to $2.20. For the fourth quarter of 2016, Kroger expects slightly positive identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel. The persistent and increasing deflation has caused us to adjust our view of identical store sales for the fourth quarter. We continue to expect capital investments of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion for the year, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of lease facilities. And we expect Kroger's full year FIFO operating margin in 2016, excluding fuel, to decline compared to 2015 results. Finally, I want to take a moment to look ahead to 2017. We're completing our business plan process for 2017 now, and we'll provide specific guidance in March as we normally do. We anticipate both positive identical supermarket sales and net earnings per diluted share growth, excluding the 53rd week. Net earnings growth will likely be below the low end of the company's 8% to 11% net earnings per diluted share long-term growth rate guidance. We expect the operating environment in the first half of 2017 to be similar today. The second half of 2017 should show improvement as we cycle the current environment. As you know, we define long term as over a 3- to 5-year time horizon, and we are committed to achieving our net earnings per diluted share growth rate guidance of 8% to 11% plus a growing dividend. We expect 2017 capital investments of $3.6 billion to $3.9 billion, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities. We will continue to make investments to reward our customers, and we'll increase our intensity in finding cost savings for these investments. Now I will turn it back to Rodney. W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike. We are both clear-eyed about the challenges before us and optimistic about Kroger's future. Transitions are no fun, but they do create opportunities to improve the way we run our business. We will continue to focus relentlessly on our customers and our associates. We'll continue to accelerate our adoption of technology to deliver additional value, to provide convenience for and to our customers and take costs out, as Mike mentioned. All these things set us up to grow our business. We have a unique opportunity for strong growth in the $1.5 trillion U.S. food market. Our best days are still ahead of us. Now we look forward to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Kenneth Goldman : Just one quick question for clarification. I know you wrote this, but I have received a couple of questions on it. When you're guiding to below 8% EPS growth in fiscal '17, is it reasonable to assume that's on a like-for-like basis, which excludes the benefit of the 53rd week? J. Schlotman: Well, it does exclude the benefit of the 53rd week. Basically, the way we business plan is just like you said, like-for-like. And then we go in and estimate what the 53rd week will ultimately add to that result. I'm not going to go to, am I going to be at 8% or 9% with the 53rd week, because I -- that would tell you what we're thinking about without the 53rd week. But the below -- the only guidance we're giving is that on a 52-week basis, we would be below the 8%. Kenneth Goldman : Got it. Okay. And then, Mike, I wanted to follow up. On CNBC, you were sort of, at least to my ears, talking about maybe deflation ebbing a little bit here. You were pointing to some commodities maybe rising. But you're also guiding, I guess, to a similar operating environment well into fiscal '17. So I just wanted to kind of make sure I understood. If deflation's the primary reason for the challenging environment today, and if you think deflation is going to get less bad, then why wouldn't early 2017's operating environment be a little bit less bad than what we're kind of seeing right now? J. Schlotman: Yes, what I was going through on CNBC is where some of the raw material markets are trending over the last 4 weeks. A lot of those, when you look at them on year-on-year, they're still quite negative. But there is some trend up in some of those categories in the input costs over the last 4 weeks, but still down on the prior year. Milk and cheese looks like it may be bottoming, but that doesn't mean things turn around on a dime as raw material input costs change. There's usually a lag from that bottom and a slight blip up in those costs until you start to see any effect on retail pricing. So we would expect this to persist. Some of that is just based on the last 2 cycles of inflation and deflation we've had. And we have a 5-year rolling average chart that we look at a lot. And if you think about the waves of where that happens with inflation and deflation, this cycle looks very similar to the last couple, maybe a little closer to '02 versus '09, which was a little bit more persistent, but that's what's in the back of our minds. Operator : Our next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. Steven Forbes : It's Steve Forbes on for John today. Given the pace of the ClickList and ExpressLane rollout thus far this year and the uptick over the past couple of weeks you mentioned, can you touch on what your thoughts are for 2017 as it relates to these initiatives? W. McMullen: We wouldn't be, at this point, sharing specifics, but obviously, it's something that continues to be important and we'll continue to roll it out. Now at some point, it will slow down a little bit just because the stores that are easy to add, we will have added them. We have identified overall how many stores we think makes sense, and it's over half of our stores we think would make sense to have ClickList. But obviously, you do the easier ones first, and it will slow down just because of the difficulty getting it installed. Steven Forbes : And then as a follow up, maybe kind of a bigger picture question about what you've seen historically as it relates to the return to an inflationary cycle, right. If you think about the competitive environment today, how do you think about '17, right, if we do get that eventual reinflation cycle? After such an extended period of deflation, I mean, do you foresee yourself and competitors rapidly passing through price increases once inflation returns? Or in the context of what we've experienced in the past and what we're experiencing now, is there any risk, right, that price increases occur on a slower basis than we may expect? W. McMullen: It's a great question. And obviously, looking back over the last 20 years or so -- what do they say? Every short statements in economics is wrong. So part of it depends on how does it come back? Does it come back with a vengeance? Or is it just 2% or 3%? At this point, we would expect for the inflation, when it becomes inflationary, for it to be pretty modest on the things that we're seeing. But remember that comment, we're very early, so that would be a very early expectation, but you don't know until you're in it. I think everybody from a competitive standpoint is looking at what's going on in the market. So typically, you'll lag a little bit at the front end, but then everybody will pass it through. And that's the reason why you'll always hear me talk about the transition periods are difficult, both going in and coming out of inflation, deflation. Steven Forbes : But the pace of increase, I guess, what you expect as you look out to '17 is very dependent on where the absolute level of inflation returns to. W. McMullen: Absolutely. And right now, like on the -- things that are grain-based, obviously, those crops, for the most part, haven't been planted yet. You'll have some winter wheat that's in that process. But crops will be a heavy driver of that inflation, and it's still way too early. I think, what, in '16, it appears that this will be a record crop for 5 years in a row. At some point, you're going to not have great weather. J. Schlotman: Never had 6. W. McMullen: I don't think we've ever had 5 before. So you never know. But there isn't anything that we see out there that would cause us to have a different point of view. Now obviously, in produce, that is -- that will change very quickly depending -- the growing seasons are much shorter there. Operator : The next question comes from Ed Kelly of Credit Suisse. Edward Kelly : So can I just start asking about guidance and just a little bit more color. So at the Analyst Day, you reaffirmed full year guidance, but openly admitted, right, that the end of Q3 was difficult to judge. Today, you ended up lowering the outlook a bit. I guess what's changed since the Analyst Day? If you could sort of like provide a bit more detail there. Is it really just the conclusion that the end of Q3 was softer than really what you were thinking? And then how is Q4 shaping up so far quarter-to-date on IDs? Are you at that point of low -- up -- low single digits? J. Schlotman: So if you think about the -- where we've been at -- from the Analyst Day and transitioning through that, I would actually encourage you to step back a bit from that and look at it at a little bit bigger lens. It takes about $23 million of sales to move our IDs by 10 basis points. When you're plus or minus $23 million on a 2- or 3-day time frame, or even $40 million on a 2- or 3-day time frame, when you're at 4% or 4.5% idents, it's a blip on the radar screen. When you're between 0 -- when you're between flat and 50 basis points of identicals, it's a huge percentage move on where your identicals can be. And when you think about $23 billion a quarter in ID sales, so $1.5 billion to $2 billion a week, the potential for a couple of days to move by $20 million is very real. You've all heard me at different times talk about -- if you saw our daily sales when calendar shifts and holiday shifts, you would understand why grocers get gray hair early in their careers. And those kinds of things just happen, and it's a big effect. The effect of milk, eggs and cheese continues to be big. It's a big headwind to ID sales this year versus last year, a meaningful percentage. I won't necessarily give the exact amount, but it's a meaningful amount. Rodney's shrugging his shoulders. So it's as much as 50 basis points effect to ID sales in the quarter, just those 3 commodities, because of the deflation this year versus last year. So these kinds of things are real. You've often heard us talk about milk being elastic when there's deflation. When it's deflation on deflation, the elasticity happens when you first break that $2 barrier and then demand flattens out. So you don't get a 2-year bump in it. W. McMullen: Yes, I would just add a little bit to Mike's comment. When Mike shared the guidance at our Analyst Day, he did talk about the uncertainty because of the calendar shifts. So there is -- what -- where we ended up was exactly consistent with what -- how Mike outlined in terms of the uncertainty for the balance of a few days. When you look at quarter-to-date in the fourth quarter, we would be slightly negative. But if you look at last year, last year's -- the first 4 weeks of last year's fourth quarter were by far the strongest, and it kept getting weaker during the quarter. So we will start cycling numbers from a year ago that look a lot different than what we've been cycling so far this year. So that's the reason why we were comfortable on giving the guidance in terms of being slightly positive for the fourth quarter. Edward Kelly : Great, and just a follow-up. On the gross margin, I guess, Rodney and Mike, your gross margin this period of -- this deflationary cycle, I guess, has been, I guess, remarkably resilient given sort of like what you've seen historically in terms of the relationship between the margin and IDs. And the competitive environment, from what we hear, right, sounds like it's more difficult. Can you just give us a sense as to what's really going on in the underlying gross margin? I mean, I know you continually invest in price, but it doesn't seem like you're being as impacted by the competitive environment as what we've seen at other places. And any color there would be great in sort of like how you think about that over the next few quarters as well. W. McMullen: Yes. I'll make a couple of comments and let Mike finish it. First of all, when you look at having Roundy's and not having Roundy's, that affected some of the year-over-year change because Roundy's has a higher gross margin than the Kroger-based, Kroger company. The other thing is that our buying teams have done a ton of work on changing the way we buy product in terms of cost of goods. And if you look, we have a lot of corporate brand products where we buy direct. So a lot of those changes have really been helpful in terms of making improvement in cost of goods, too, which has helped some on the cost -- the gross margin line. I know Mike, you -- I'm sure you have a couple of other comments you want to add. J. Schlotman: Yes. I think the one I would go a little deeper on is the corporate brands. And as we continue to have an expansion of our Private Selection line, when you look at Simple Truth continuing to grow nearly -- basically, double digits, those kinds of products contain a higher gross margin as well. And as they continue to become a higher and higher portion of our mix, that somewhat distorts the historical reference. The number's a little bit difficult to interpret this quarter because of the fact of the dairy complex, because such a high percentage of the dairy complex is corporate brands. The other thing that's in there is the fresh mix. You heard Rodney talk a lot about being on top of the foodie trends and snacking and things like that. Those departments do come with a higher gross margin mix. Now their contribution to overhead or their operating profit may not be as strong as other departments because there's a lot of labor costs and more shrink in those categories and more fixed costs like electricity and things like that. So it's a combination of all those leading to it. Rest assured, we do continue to invest in price and continue to drive value to our customers. And it's something that we've -- been our cornerstone for the last 14 years. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : So I wanted to kind of take a different direction here a little bit and talk more about the nonfresh, maybe even the branded side, the branded -- which some of the data coming out lately has shown volumes are just negative in the measured channel. And then also inquire about e-commerce, you've obviously seen Walmart buy Jet.com. Amazon is making some big inroads all of a sudden into some of these consumable categories, these everyday essential categories. And just in that context, get your guys' perspective on what's going to happen with margins, what's going to happen with these categories and how do you react to an environment that seems to changing pretty quickly? W. McMullen: Well, there's about 10 questions within that. So I'm trying to... J. Schlotman: So you don't get a follow up, Scott. W. McMullen: I'll try to summarize it in such a way that it's helpful. When you look at our relationships with the CPGs, it would be -- our business, with most of those CPG partners, would continue to grow. And the trends that they would be seeing overall, for the most part, the trends we would be seeing is different. In terms of -- at our Analyst Day, we increasingly see competition much broader than we would have in the past. And we're really focused on, how do we give the customer what they want when they want it in the way they want it? And Amazon is one way of doing that. But not every customer wants to have 10 boxes of stuff sitting in front of their door all day. What we find is a lot of customers love having groceries picked -- picking it up. And we're starting to test, obviously, we -- partnering with third parties to deliver. So for us, we're really focused on the customer and letting the customer decide how to engage and doing it in a way that's seamless. We've always said that we believe margins over time will continue to decline from a gross profit margin standpoint. And that's the reason why we worked so hard to get costs out, partner with 84.51\u00b0 in using -- and partnering with our technology teams to fundamentally change the way we do work to get costs out. I don't know, Mike, anything you want to add? J. Schlotman: No, and I -- one of the things -- I agree 100% with Rodney on the e-commerce relative to deliveries and being on your porch. And where we're situated, our customers live within 2 or 3 miles of the store they most regularly shop in. And it's extremely convenient for them to order online and make that stop by the store on their way to and from either work or daily activities. And the easiest way to see if a retailer is excited about something is, are they doing more of it or less of it? And as Rodney said, we continue to roll more ClickList locations out. Operator : Our next question comes from Karen Short of Barclays. Sean Kras : This is Sean on for Karen. Can you guys provide -- can you provide some color on tonnage trends this quarter versus the first 2 quarters of the year? J. Schlotman: Tonnage trends continue to be positive for the quarter. I would -- there is some softening from the second quarter to the third quarter in tonnage. But overall, we're -- we continue to have positive tonnage, and we continue to grow our share. In some of the categories, we're very pleased with the tonnage growth we're seeing. It's -- tonnage is a little bit of a difficult animal to get your arms around because there are so many pack-size changes. Today -- it used to be, you bought a -- well, you didn't even buy bottled water, and then you bought a 12-pack of bottled water, then you bought 24-pack of bottled water. Now you buy a 32-pack of bottled water. All of those are 1 unit, even though we're selling more bottled water units. And there's a lot of multipacks and bigger packs that are trending to that kind of an opportunity. You also see some of that with ClickList in categories that customers are finding convenient to buy bigger packs because they don't have to fill up their basket cart with it. We do that for them and put it in their trunk. So they may be buying a 12-pack of paper towels instead of a 4-pack of paper towels, because they don't have to worry about space in the basket cart. It's just -- as long as their trunk can hold it, it's okay. We continue to be pleased with our tonnage growth. It's something we know is the fundamental piece of what is core to our business. Sean Kras : Okay, that's helpful. Then, I guess, my follow-up would be just some color on extra week next year and the impact to earnings per share. We went back and looked at 2012 as sort of a proxy for that and thought that the merchant flow-through would -- maybe equates about $0.09 a share. Just wondering if you could give some comments on that. J. Schlotman: Well, one extra week out of 52 is a little over 1.9%. The gives and takes of that and what happens inside that week drive what the benefit of it is. But historically, it's -- I would agree that it's somewhere in that range, but it's difficult to understand what's going to happen in the first week of late January, early February of 2018. W. McMullen: We do always try to break that out and provide that insight because we don't take credit for that extra week in terms of achieving numbers. As we mentioned in our prepared comments, we are in the middle of our business plan process and just wanted to give you a little bit of flavor of what we're seeing next year's shape up to be and letting people know the 53rd week, we're not taking credit for achieving the numbers. Operator : Our next question comes from Zach Fadem of Wells Fargo. Zachary Fadem : You mentioned several times during the call, just a focus going forward on taking costs out. Can you talk a little bit about what this means for things like employee costs, wages, health care, store productivity initiatives, pension, stuff like that? W. McMullen: I would say probably all of those -- all of the above are things that we're working on. One of the things that we've been able to do over the last several years is through process change, changing the way work is done. And we continue to see great opportunities there. And we're really working hard on partnering with our R&D team and our technology team to take things -- to change the way we do work. And I know Mike at our investor meeting talked a little bit about temperature monitoring. And temperature monitoring, for example, is something that we developed internally with our R&D team. We've rolled it out, and it saves about $25 million a year in terms of just what it costs to execute it. Obviously, it takes capital to do that. So the first year doesn't create too much value, but the second year and beyond is great value. So labor is always the area where there's the most opportunity. We will do those savings there through process changes. We think it's incredibly important. Zachary Fadem : Okay. And just a follow-up. I know it's still early days here, but are there any metrics you can provide on the performance of your ClickList stores? Maybe is there data to suggest that sales are incremental? And do you view ClickList as a potential driver of market share or rather just an added convenience for your customers over time? W. McMullen: Yes. The -- I'll try -- obviously, we're very, very early, so I won't be able to answer all of the questions you asked. They're great questions. It's just that we're so early in the process. It would be some growing share and some just one more convenience for the customer. And it's really a mix of both, and each customer would be a different combination of that mix. What we believe over time is that it starts teaching us how do we deliver what the customer wants, the way they want it, when they want it. So we think it's something that's even more important than just ClickList per se in terms of teaching us how to connect with the customer even deeper and in a better way for them. Some of the business is incremental. It's a reasonably high range when you look across the company. If you look at the financial performance, it's a headwind initially. If you go back and look at some of the original locations that Harris Teeter had before we merged, it becomes where you're indifferent whether somebody shops via ClickList or in the store. But if you look at the stores overall, it's still a reasonable, significant headwind in terms of rolling out ClickList from a financial standpoint. Operator : Our next question comes from Shane Higgins of Deutsche Bank. Shane Higgins : I just wanted to drill down a little bit on your ID sales by region. Did you guys see any significant regional differences in ID sales during the quarter? Anything that you could call out? J. Schlotman: Yes. We always see ID sales ranges by region. When we're in 30-something states plus D.C., it's like anything else, there's somebody that's at the top of the list and somebody at the bottom of the list. We typically don't go into specific geographic descriptions of where we saw relative strength and where we saw relative weakness, if you will, or towards the bottom end. Broad-based, again, I would say the story is pretty much the same for all of the regions with the persistent deflation. And a continued focus on trying to drive tonnage is the story that we're trying to drive home with all of our geographies. Shane Higgins : Okay, that's helpful. And I know you guys earlier in the year, you talked about Roundy's as being a 30 basis point headwind to the comp. But obviously, you're going to cycle that in fourth quarter. Is that -- first of all, is that about right? Was it -- has it been around 30 basis points? And as we do cycle that, do you guys expect that to help contribute to the comp improvement as the fourth quarter progresses? J. Schlotman: Yes. If you think about Roundy's even more broadly than that, it is still in that same kind of a range. We've talked about that we've gone into 13 stores in Wisconsin and have done those stores the way we want them done. And we continue to be very pleased with the sales and tonnage growth inside those stores. We've also converted those 13 stores to our -- to the Kroger systems, which, for us, relative to a merger, is lighting speed because we want to get them integrated into our -- all of our processes as quickly as possible. We remain very excited about that merger and the potential we see. Particularly, the Wisconsin assets I think is -- if you will, if you think about it in purely economic terms, is the optionality of that merger. Getting into Chicago for the cost of the entire merger was great. And as Wisconsin with Michael Marx and his team running Wisconsin, that will continue to be a very positive thing for us in the future. It's not going to turn on a dime. It's a lot of hard work, but the team up there is up to the challenge. W. McMullen: Yes. The one thing that -- and you've heard me say this before, the thing that I've really been pleased with in Mariano's and the Wisconsin stores with Pick 'n Save and Copps and Metro are the engagement of our store associates and how supportive they've been and how excited they've been. And the changes that we're making, we're seeing a little bit more improvement in tonnage than we are in identical sales results, just because some of the changes deflate the retail prices. But I'm just thrilled and delighted with our teams and the way our teams are engaging and excited about being part of the Kroger team, and much more so than I would have expected this early in the process. Shane Higgins : All right. I appreciate that color. So just in terms of kind of thinking over the next year or 2, so this is going to be something that, obviously, Mike, you said, you guys have done some conversion. You still have a lot more to go. So this would be something that will probably be a multi-quarter effort. We shouldn't expect to see any significant tailwinds then from Roundy's over the next couple of quarters [ph]. J. Schlotman: Yes. I -- It's clearly something -- it's -- we're coming up on the 1-year anniversary of the closure of the merger. I think it was December 18 of last year. So it's very new part of our book of business. And it is going to be something that over time will continue to be worked on. I wouldn't -- I can tell you, part of our business plan process is not a tailwind from Wisconsin in 2017; individual stores, yes, but overall, no. Operator : Our next question comes from Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley. Andrew Ruben : This is Andrew Ruben on for Vinny. I just had a question on deflation, bigger picture. You characterized being in mid-cycle. Just curious what drives that characterization. And given that you've been through a few of these cycles, as you referenced, any color on how the cycle that we're in compares to the few you've experienced over the past 30 years? W. McMullen: Well, the -- the bigger picture is it probably looks the most like the one in 2002. That one, really, it was about 5 quarters. And if you look at when it was the worst is in the middle of it, and that's kind of where we are. Part of it will -- part of it determines what -- I'm trying to think about how to word this in a way that's helpful. The cycle coming out will be driven by what caused you to go in and how do you end up coming out of it. Everything that we can see, the reason what we would expect today would be a modest increase once we cycle on the other side of it is most of it is supply-oriented. So if you look at like 2008 and 2009, it was as much driven by the economy and everything going on. If you look at 2002, it was more supply-driven because there was a lot of supply in the market. Unless there would just be a terrible crop year in '17, we would expect this to look much more like 2002. Remember, once -- and Mike talked about it a little bit, like on dairy, if you have $3 a gallon milk and it goes to $2 a gallon milk, when you cycle that the next year and if milk is still at $2 a gallon, you're cycling $2 on $2 versus $2 on $3. And that's the reason why the pressures decreases. I don't know, Mike, anything else you want to add that? J. Schlotman: No. W. McMullen: Andrew, is that helpful? Andrew Ruben : That is. Operator : Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : So the first question I had was just on traffic. Your press release, it sounds like in your press release, you again had positive household -- loyal households growth. I just want to get a sense, as you look at your traffic this quarter or this, I guess, Q3, were there any changes versus what you saw in Q2? I just want to get a sense on how traffic played out versus your expectations. W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at it versus expectations, it's pretty similar. It continues to be positive. In terms of playing out, you always want more traffic than you had, but I would have said that every quarter. I don't know, Mike, from your perspective. I think it really well played out the way we would expect. J. Schlotman: I agree with you. W. McMullen: We felt like third quarter would be a very tough quarter, given everything that what was going on. And -- but you start cycling some of those things as well. Rupesh Parikh : Okay, great. And then for gas margins. I just want to get a sense what your outlook is for the balance of the year. And as you think about where gas fuel margins could end up for this year, do you expect to be back at your historical average on the fuel margin line? J. Schlotman: Fuel has certainly been a wild ride the last few years and even in the last few even days and weeks as -- is OPEC going to do something? Is OPEC not going to do something? And they ultimately did the 32.5 billion -- or billion gallon decline -- barrel decline, 32.5 billion barrel. I put the b on the dollar -- the number instead of the barrel. That equates to 500,000 barrels a day. And to see the wild swings down $1.50 one day, up almost $4 the next day is kind of confusing on what's -- when you look at that relative to worldwide supply of oil is relatively modest amount of production cut. That said, volatility, up and down. Volatility is generally very positive for us because we have many, many fuel centers at our supermarket locations that get not just a delivery a day, but some of them get a couple of deliveries a day. So when there's daily volatility like that, it allows us to take advantage of market fluctuations. W. McMullen: Yes. When we do our business planning process, we always just use the 5-year rolling average. We find that's as close as anything else. I think Mike mentioned, if you look at over a rolling 4 quarter to a rolling 4 quarter, fuel margins are down just shy of a couple of cents. But for us, anybody's guess is as good as anybody else's. And I always get a kick out of -- if gas is at $100 a barrel, it's going to $150. And if it's at $50, it's going to $20. Neither of which have ever been right. But we just, in terms of the way we do our planning process, we look at a 5-year rolling average. When we look at, do our shareholders get a return for us being in that business, we also do the same thing. J. Schlotman: And we essentially business plan the nonfuel business, add the fuel business on, and then, of course, this -- we'll then add the 53rd week on. Operator : Our next question comes from Robbie Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Robert Ohmes : Rodney, for people like me who were not covering this industry back in '02, I was hoping you could maybe give us some insights. How does this deflation and promo environment change the way your customer is shopping? Or does it? Like for example, you called out snacks and drinks, maybe some color on other categories. Or also, does sort of the balance of fill-in versus stock-up change? How does the reaction to promos change in sort of a multi-quarter deflationary environment? And maybe some color on what happens in center-of-store when you're in an environment like this? And I have to ask because I don't think anybody did, but just the question you love getting, what's Walmart doing right now promotionally? Are they investing more and more in price in the markets you're in? W. McMullen: Okay. Well, if you look at the '02 versus today, probably the biggest change from a customer standpoint, I guess, it would be 2 things. One, obviously, they buy food that's already prepared much more. And when we shared everything at our Investor Day, you could see a lot of the changes that we've done in terms of having food that you can come to one of stores and eat at the store or take home and eat. That, obviously, is a huge change today versus '02. If you look at the things that are -- and I guess, the other big change is customers shop more frequently but smaller baskets. So if you go back then, and we didn't have a loyalty card, and we didn't have the analysis we do today. But everything we could find, the customer would -- the basket would be bigger on an individual basis. But if you look at a monthly basis, it's bigger today. In terms of the cycle comments, the things that we think are the same are more the materials in raw ingredients space, where if you look at beef and pork and chicken, the biggest component of that is corn price. And chicken in that cycle is much quicker than it is on pork and beef. And that hasn't changed now versus 2002. So it's really what's the raw materials themselves and how's the growing crops doing and how does that flow through the supply chain. And that would have the biggest effect on some of the proteins and some of the center store components. I don't know, Mike, on inflation, anything that... J. Schlotman: No, I think you covered it. W. McMullen: Both of us were around in '02 as well. We had different jobs. J. Schlotman: I think you covered landscape. Well, you did, I didn't. Robert Ohmes : Maybe, guys, just on -- if you think back to '02, I don't know if you can remember, but in terms of promotionally how the competition reacted, has that changed a lot? Is it -- is there more in-store signage? Or is it more circulars? Or what are the promotional tactics that are being used right now out there? And is it similar or different than '02 from the competition? W. McMullen: Well, on the promotional stuff, the -- you would -- in '02, and this is going off of a lot of memory without having the data in front of me. But competitors then didn't have as much insights, and they didn't know if it was just because somebody was getting their sales or if it was deflation. Today, people have much better data. So they understand it's things that's going on in the overall marketplace. It's not some competitor getting the business. So all of us reacted in a different kind of way at the front end of deflation back then because you thought a competitor was getting the business. J. Schlotman: Yes, and that parallels Rodney's comment on basket size. Historically, all we would see is what's the average transaction per customer. And if that's softening, back in '02 when you didn't have the data, you didn't know that that household was coming more times in a monthly basis and it wound up spending more with you on a month because we simply didn't have that technology back then. Robert Ohmes : Got it. That's helpful. And just quickly, Walmart, any color on any changes in their level of price investment? W. McMullen: Yes. It would be similar to what we've seen before in terms of our comments. As you know, we won't talk too much about specific competitors. We have a ton of respect for them. There is no doubt they continue to improve. But that's the same comments I made at the investor call and I made at the last quarter. And all of us would have different approaches in different regions of the country. Operator : And our last question will come from William Kirk of RBC. William Kirk : So I'm still a little confused about the end of the third quarter. If ID sales have been running at essentially 0.5 with 2 weeks left and finished at 0.1, does that imply the last 2 weeks were down 2%? And then taking the calendar commentary, does that imply Halloween sales or sales associated with Halloween are down, too, thanks to moving from a weekday to a -- or moving from a weekend to a weekday? J. Schlotman: Yes. I don't know if I'll get that precise in answering the question because daily fluctuations are always dangerous because of things like you cited, Halloween moving between days. I don't think we said that we were absolutely at the low end of our 50 basis points to 150 basis points ID guidance. We said we were near it, and it's actually -- in our original guidance for that, we expect that the third quarter to not get to the low end, but the fourth quarter to be above the low end to bring us inside that range. And we didn't end up the third quarter drastically different than we did. And I think it's -- maybe it was my communication skills back on November 2, and people hearing that we're near the low end, just assuming that you're at the low end. I go back to, it takes $20 million in a quarter to move ID sales by 10 basis points. So the fluctuations when you're in this range, if I missed those 4 days that were left by $20 million, that cuts my ID sales in half if I was at 20 basis points. If I'm at 4%, it goes to 3.9%, and it's not a very big deal. W. McMullen: Thanks, William. Before we end today's call, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. Being part of millions of families' celebrations this holiday season is a great honor and privilege. Our customers count on us to have what they need and more, and you make it all happen. Just last week, nearly 10.5 million customers shopped with us on Tuesday and 13.5 million on Wednesday before Thanksgiving. That's incredible. A huge thank you. No matter where you work, you make the holidays special for our customers, our communities and each other. I also want to thank our store teams for their outstanding response to our national hiring event in November for all military veterans and family members. We hired 4,000 veterans and family members in one day, which is nearly 3,000 more than last year's event. We are delighted to welcome them to our Kroger family as part of our continuing commitment to active duty troops and the nation's 23 million veterans. Thank you for all you do every day. Merry Christmas and happy holidays to you and your family. That completes our call today. Thanks for joining. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a great day.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Kate Ward, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kate Ward : Thank you, Carrie. Good morning, and thank you for joining us.  Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our fourth quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. W. McMullen: Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 results is Mike Schlotman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.  As we all know, some times are just more challenging than others, and last year certainly didn't end the way we expected at the start of the year. But 2016 still had its bright spots. Of course, our associates and our customers are always a bright spot, and I'm so proud of this team for their continuing focus on taking care of our customers each and every time they interact in our stores. Despite the challenging operating environment, our team pulled together to deliver some results that we should take stock of. Over the past year, the Kroger team delivered our 12th consecutive year of market share growth; overall tonnage growth; record-high unit share in our Corporate Brands portfolio, which was led by another blockbuster $1.7 billion year for Simple Truth; a strategic merger with specialty pharmacy leader, ModernHEALTH; and reached an agreement to merge with the world's greatest purveyor of specialty cheese, Murray's Cheese; and we created more than 12,000 new American jobs in our stores and hired more than 9,000 veterans and military family members. That's a lot to be proud of.  We're obviously disappointed with our identical supermarket sales number in the fourth quarter and our performance on several other KPIs, including FIFO operating margin and return on invested capital, which were driven by the deflationary environment. Kroger is always focused on executing against our long-term strategy. We are lowering costs to invest those savings in our people, our business and the technologies to position Kroger to deliver the value proposition customers are seeking today and in the future. One example of our efforts to control administrative costs is making the very difficult decision to extend the voluntary retirement offer for certain nonstore associates that we announced in December. Approximately 2,000 nonstore associates were eligible for the offer, and at this point, we estimate approximately 1,300 will accept it.  As our customers change and evolve, we are taking steps to meet them where they are and more importantly, where they are going. We're making meaningful investments in digital. We feel great about these investments because customers tell us they are important to them. We have aggressively added more than 420 ClickList and ExpressLane locations in 2016, bringing our total online ordering locations to more than 640. This effort was based on learnings from our merger with Harris Teeter. We are also experimenting with ways to solve the last mile equation. We're testing with Uber delivery in several locations with plans to expand in 2017 where our customers can order through ClickList and choose to have their groceries delivered by a local Uber driver. We have a couple of other home delivery tests as well. We're building our digital experiences today, so that customers can engage and shop for anything, anytime, anywhere with us in the future. The excellent service they get from our associates in the stores will carry over seamlessly to the digital platforms whether shopping online, finding great promotions and recipes that are personalized and relevant to them or downloading more than -- one of the more than 1 billion digital offers loaded to shopper carts each year.  More and more customers are connecting digitally with Kroger. We are leveraging refined customer insights from 84.51\u00b0 as well as years of online shopping experience from both Vitacost.com and Harris Teeter to develop a sophisticated understanding of our customers' behavior when shopping with us online, in-store and both. We're utilizing this rich data sort set to make decisions about where the right locations to offer ClickList, what are the right assortments and promotions to engage customers online and how can we offer the quality and convenience online that customers have come to expect from a Kroger brick-and-mortar location. We are also keenly aware of growing customer trends like health and wellness and high-quality fresh and prepared foods. Our initiatives in these areas are designed to deliver convenience to our time-starved customers and will continue to be a big focus of both our capital and Customer 1st investments.  Now we could stop all of these investments given the headwinds our industry is facing. That might make our results look better today, but we are playing for the long term, and that requires being deliberate and determined. There are a lot of companies out there right now investing in digital and e-commerce in opportunistic ways that will likely never create value for their shareholders. A core strength of Kroger is our ability both create shareholder value today and to make meaningfully strategic investments for the future. We remain determined to execute on our strategy, and we are deliberately investing to grow and create long-term value for our shareholders.  Our Corporate Brands business was another real bright spot in 2016. Our brands are in more homes than ever before. In fact, our customers fill their carts with more than 1.25 million Corporate Brand items every hour. We are incredibly proud of the quality of our Corporate Brand products. Our quality is only getting better, and that showed clearly in the Corporate Brands' performance last year when we sold a record number of units and in the fourth quarter, when Corporate Brands had an all-time-high unit share of 29.2%.  Simple Truth grew at an impressive rate again in 2016, reaching total sales of $1.7 billion. Simple Truth Organic accounted for more than $1 billion of that figure last year, and we still see more growth ahead in our Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic lines. In fact, we've begun offering Simple Truth to even more customers throughout the United States by making it available on Vitacost.com. Today, you can find online and conveniently ship to home many of our Simple Truth's food, snacks and supplements as well as household and personal care products. Interestingly, New York City is already the #2 Simple Truth online sales market for us, even though we don't have store physical presence there.  As you know, we always build our business plan assuming the environment is going to get more competitive the next year and not less. We also don't run a business model that relies on inflation returning. Rather, we proactively make the changes we need to, to remain competitive well into the future. Kroger's core strengths remain our most valuable assets. On the people front, we have great associates, an effective and experienced management team and a deep bench of future leaders; on the financial front, a strong balance sheet and the flexibility to create sustainable shareholder value; and on the consumer front, deep customer insights through our data analytic experts at 84.51\u00b0 and above all, an unwavering commitment to putting our customers first.  What also remains unchanged is our commitment to long-term growth that investors can count on. Over the last 5 years, Kroger's annual net earnings per diluted share growth rate was 16.3%, excluding onetime items. Over the last 3 years, it was 14.2%, excluding onetime items. We remain committed to delivering our long-term net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 8% to 11% plus a growing dividend.  And now Mike will go into more detail on our fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 results. Mike? J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger's market share grew for the 12th year in a row. Our consistent market share gains drive both top and bottom line growth and generate lasting shareholder value. We report our market share annually and look at it the way customers would look at it : where they spend their money.  According to Nielsen POS plus data, Kroger's overall market share of the products we sell in the markets where we operate grew approximately 20 basis points in 2016 with 14 of 22 markets up, 2 flat and 6 markets down. Starting in 2017, we plan to begin using IRI point-of-sales data to measure market share. While we expect there to be some differences in share reporting between Nielsen and IRI, we expect those differences to be minimal. Regardless of the source, we use market share data as a directional measure and not a specific one. It is also worth noting that market share data is calculated based on total sales and not ID sales.  Looking at ID sales, deflation was the primary driver of our negative results for the quarter. Inflation-adjusted ID sales were positive in the fourth quarter.  Deflation, excluding fuel, persisted at 1.3% compared to 1.1% in the third quarter. During the quarter, we saw a decline in pharmacy inflation, an acceleration in produce deflation and a slowing in grocery deflation.  Another headwind to ID sales was our capital program. Over the last 4 quarters, we relocated or expanded 35 strong performing stores, taking them out of our identical supermarket sales calculation. This caused about a 70 basis point headwind to ID sales in the fourth quarter.  Tonnage was positive during the fourth quarter, and we continue to focus on the areas of highest growth like natural and organic products, which, by the way, hit nearly $16 billion in sales in 2016 in areas where we are saving customers' time such as ready-to-eat and ready-to-eat meal solutions. We always give a little insight into our ID sales data. Visits per household, and price per unit were down in the fourth quarter, but those were slightly offset by basket size and household growth. Loyal households continue to grow at a faster rate than total households, which was true for both the quarter and the year. It is interesting to note that loyal households has slightly positive ID growth in the fourth quarter.  Operating, general and administrative costs as a rate of sales, excluding fuel, recent mergers and a $30 million contributions in the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan in the fourth quarter of 2015, declined by 11 basis points. Rent and depreciation, with the same exclusions, increased by 24 basis points. While this result was better than the third quarter, we can, and we'll do better. We are working diligently to pull costs out of the business and improve processes to lower costs through the rate of sales and deliver value to customers.  Now for an update on retail fuel. In the fourth quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.172 compared to $0.169 in the same quarter last year. The average retail price of fuel was $2.18 versus $1.92 in the same quarter last year. For 2016 in total, we were at $0.171 for the year and $0.174 in 2015.  Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.31x compared to 2.08x during the same period last year. This result is due to the merger with ModernHEALTH and increases in working capital. The increase in working capital is driven by higher inventory in 4 locations where we opened new or expanded distribution centers. When doing this, we duplicate inventory for a period of time to ensure a smooth transition. Also, accrued liabilities are lower due to lower incentive plan payout accruals. This portion will reverse itself in the first quarter when incentive plan cash payments will be lower.  It is worth noting that over a longer-time horizon, we do expect our net total debt to EBITDA ratio to grow. This is because we continue to work with our unions to modify pension plans. We continue to negotiate restructuring of troubled multi-employer pension plan obligations to help stabilize associates' future benefits as we did in the second quarter. These restructurings do not change the total obligations of the company because the debt we had is offset by a reduction in the amount of our off-balance sheet multi-employer pension plan obligations.  In 2016, Kroger used cash to repurchase $1.8 billion in common shares, paid $429 million in dividends, invest $3.6 billion in capital and merged with ModernHEALTH for approximately $390 million. Capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, totaled $3.6 billion for the year compared to $3.5 billion last year. The flexibility to the return to -- the return value to shareholders is a core strength of our financial strategy. Return on invested capital for 2016 was 13.09%. This result was affected by current year results and recently merged companies. We are committed to growing return on invested capital over the long term.  I will now provide a brief update on labor relations. We recently agreed to a new contract with the Teamsters for our Roundy's distribution center and with the UFCW partner, North Carolina clerks and meat associates. We are currently negotiating contracts covering store associates in Atlanta and Michigan. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive cost and compensation packages that provides solid wages, good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates.  Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger continues to communicate with our local unions, which represent many of our associates, the importance of growing Kroger's business and doing it profitably, which help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.  Turning now to our guidance for fiscal 2017. We anticipate identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, to range from flat to 1% growth for 2017. We expect net earnings to range from $2.21 to $2.25 per diluted share, including an estimated $0.09 benefit for the 53rd week. We anticipate the operating environment in the first half of 2017 to be similar to the second half of 2016. Our results in the second half of '17 should show improvement as we cycle the previous year.  We recognize that this is an unusual year, and that's why we are going to provide a quarterly cadence relative to last year, rather than compare it to our long-term guidance rate as we've done in the past. In fact, for the first quarter, we're going to give you an earnings per share range, which is not something we plan to do over the long term, but we think it's important to be very clear about how we think the year is going to progress.  For net earnings per diluted share, we expect the first quarter to be in the $0.55 to $0.59 range, the second quarter to be slightly up compared to last year, the third quarter to be up strongly compared to last year and the fourth quarter to be up high single digits compared to last year without the benefit of the 53rd week. Our guidance for the year excludes the estimated cost of the voluntary retirement offer but does include the anticipated expense savings, which we will reinvest in the business. Over the long term, we are committed to achieving a net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 8% to 11% plus a growing dividend.  We expect a LIFO charge of $25 million for the year. We expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to be in the $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion range for 2017. Capital expenditures in 2017 will be focused on sales-generating initiatives, remodels, upgrades to our logistics network and merchandising systems and digital and technology initiatives. As we invest more in these areas, our investment in stores will be reduced. And we anticipate Kroger's full year FIFO operating margin in 2017, excluding fuel, to decline approximately 10 basis points compared to 2016 results.  Now I will turn it back to Rodney. W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike. We've never been more determined about our future. We continue to focus on gaining the larger share in the $1.5 trillion U.S. food market. We are working on process changes to lower costs and use those savings to invest in our people, our business and technologies that will enhance Kroger's competitiveness in the future. We will continue to deliver for our customers today while setting the company up for our next phase of growth in Customer 1st innovation. We know that when we deliver for our customers, we create long-term value for our shareholders.  Now we look forward to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities, LLC. John Heinbockel : So Rodney, let me start with ClickList. Generally speaking, what's the rollout plan for '17? Or do you want to study the 420 a bit more? And then, what have you learned from the 420 you did last year in terms of driving new customer acquisition and building share of wallet with loyal households? Anything you can share on that? W. McMullen: Okay. If you look at the '17 plan, at this point, we would expect probably to open a few less in '17 than '16, but it's not driven by the enthusiasm for ClickList. It's driven by finding stores with the space in it and incorporating it, and getting zoning changes and anything else that we need to do. One of the things -- probably, the biggest learning that's at least been a surprise to me, probably not for others, is customers continue to shop inside the store even when they become a ClickList customer. And they'll buy certain products via ClickList, but they still come into the store. If you look at the more mature locations, you can start seeing more financially, they start getting to the point where we're really indifferent in terms of whether somebody shops in store or online. Obviously, that's just the early ones that have been opened more at Harris Teeter than at Kroger. So we continue to have that headwind, and we'll continue to have that headwind in '17 just because the sheer number that we're opening and the number that we opened late in 2016. But they continue to mature, and we can clearly see at a point where we're actually indifferent on how the customer shops with us. John Heinbockel : Okay. And then just shifting gears, 2 maybe not related but financial questions. FIFO gross margin x fuel, a little more pressure in the fourth quarter than prior quarters. Where did that come from? And then, the first quarter, when you look at the cadence in the first quarter earnings number, obviously, a substantial deviation from the rest of the year. So curious, is that driven by -- you would think it's driven by something aberrational. I don't know if that's pension or shrink, or what drives that? W. McMullen: I'll let Mark -- Mike talk about the quarter stuff. But on the -- if you look at the gross, it's really a combination of several things. Some would be driven by pharmacy continues to be a headwind on gross. Other areas there, we have definitely become more promotional and more aggressive on some pricing as our sales were softer. So it's really both of those elements together.  Mike, I'll let you answer the quarter comment. J. Schlotman: Sure, John. As I said in the prepared remarks, we do expect the first half of the year to be much like how 2016 ended, and it's really just carrying the current trends out through the first -- as you know, this is a 16-week quarter for us, through those first 16 weeks of the year, and we see the clarity to some of the programs Rodney mentioned. And the fact that we continue to drive unit growth, we do expect to see the recovery in the sales later in the year. Operator : The next question comes from Stephen Tanal of Goldman, Sachs & Co. Stephen Tanal : I guess I'd just ask, what you guys are seeing in the competitive environment, to start? Clearly, there's at least some chains that are putting up slightly better comps or better comps, and obviously, versus Nielsen, it looks like you're gaining share. But I wonder what you're seeing, and if you feel like there's a certain customer you may be losing or if there is something you could comment on markets where you're competing with more online challengers. Just any color there in terms of where you think some of the traffic may be headed. W. McMullen: If you look at it from a competitive environment, most of the changes that we would see is competitors running better stores. I don't think there's any doubt that they are. Most -- you and among others have written about it. Certainly, it wouldn't -- there isn't anything that would show that it's going to online at all. So it would be more driven by some of the competitors running better stores versus other aspects.  I don't know, Mike, anything you'd want to add to that? J. Schlotman: No. Stephen Tanal : I guess, is that -- can you give a sense for whether it's a lower-end customer or a higher-income consumer or right in the middle, or any color you can provide there? W. McMullen: If you -- one of the comments that Mike mentioned in his prepared remarks was when you look at our loyal shopper, we actually had positive identicals with our loyal shoppers. So it's really the customer that isn't very loyal to us. It's where we're seeing it. That would be more driven by value shoppers or shoppers on a budget than mainstream and customers that really value the experience and the freshness of our product and other aspects. Stephen Tanal : I see. And I guess, it's safe to say you're probably not seeing all too different in sort of a bigger, denser, more affluent cities that you're in where there are more home delivery options. And I just got one more follow-up on -- one more after that. W. McMullen: Yes. We're really not seeing it from that aspect at all. And the other thing I think is important to note, we aggressively increased the amount of capital we were spending and increased the number of stores that we were relocating and remodeling, and Mike mentioned it. But if you look at about 35 stores we relocated or expanded, which took them out of the identical calculation, which actually hurt our total company identicals by 70 basis points. So I think that's the other thing that's important to remember. Stephen Tanal : That's helpful. Then I just -- the last one for me, maybe for Mike is, the impact of the early retirement offer on OG&A, if you could sort of quantify that, and perhaps maybe is that ramping through the year? Is that maybe why the year looks a little more back-half-weighted than we would have guessed? Or I think... J. Schlotman: Sure. As I said in the prepared remarks, the -- as we finalize what the expense of that will be, that will be reflected in the first quarter. The offer is not entirely closed. So we won't know until next week exactly how many people ultimately accepted the offer. And there will be varying times when people ultimately retire, so that does go throughout the year as we -- as those folks ultimately retire. Do keep in mind, as I said in the prepared remarks, we do not have the expense of the plan in our estimates. We do have the savings in our plan and they're a portion of what we plan to invest to increase the value proposition for our customers. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Mandeville of Jefferies. Chris  Mandeville: So just maybe sticking with the guidance here. Is it fair to assume that gross margins will be down in a similar fashion for the first half of this year just kind of given Q4 results and commentary for the full year being down 10 basis points? And then, I guess, for the back half of the year, that would imply, I would assume, some gross margin expansion, to some degree. I get maybe Q4, but can you help us understand why Q3 should be implying 20%-plus EPS growth? And lastly, how does deflation or inflation for that matter play into 1H versus 2H? J. Schlotman: Yes. I mean, there's a variety of contributing factors. Obviously, going back to the first quarter, we're cycling one of, if not, the strongest quarter from the prior year. We had high teens earnings per share growth. We had 2.4% IDs in the first quarter of last year, so we're up against our toughest compare for one thing. Also, as we go through the year, I'm not going to -- I won't break down gross profit by quarter. We try to stick with ID sales and operating profit. We do plan to continue to make the investments, as I said, in the value proposition for our customers, which we think will continue to drive IDs back into the positive range. Operator : The next question comes from Karen Short of Barclays. Karen Short : Just on the guidance, just to clarify 1 or 2 things. So guidance does include buybacks, correct? J. Schlotman: It does. Karen Short : Okay. And I would assume that maybe given that you have more free cash flow this year than last that the priorities will be skewed to buybacks? J. Schlotman: We did not give any specific guidance on the level of buyback we'll do. It'll obviously be dependent on market conditions as well as our board being willing to give us incremental authorization. We will run out of our existing authorization here in the very near term. We've been buying shares since late last year and all through so far this year, off of a grid established in the 10b5-1 plan. So it'll be somewhat predicated on our board giving us incremental authority. Karen Short : Okay, that's helpful. Sorry, were you going to say something? W. McMullen: Yes. And the other thing that Mike mentioned in his prepared comments, if you look at the range of estimated capital investment in '17 is lower than '16 as well. Karen Short : Right. So okay, with that then in mind, I guess, when I look at your guidance and I try to kind of back in the operating profit growth, it does look like you can get there but with some pretty meaningful offsets to SG&A in terms of SG&A per week. And SG&A per week has been growing pretty meaningfully, and I know you pointed to that as an area of opportunity, and you talked about that a lot on this call. But I guess, I'm just trying to reconcile like how much you actually have to get that down to achieve your guidance but also reconciling that with that you want to invest for the long term. So wondering if you could talk to that a little bit. J. Schlotman: Well, there -- I can tell you, there are a lot of efforts we have under way to reduce our total cost of doing business, and it's in a variety of areas. We can do better on shrink. We can do better on store growth productivity in some areas. We can certainly do better on in-stock in some areas. And one of the great things about being in a company the size and breadth of Kroger is there's not an initiative we have out there that we don't already have a very large group of stores achieving. We don't have to go outside the company and point to competitor X is doing this, so we are. Every metric we have out there for our stores to do better on, we already have a group of stores achieving those results. And as we get better at achieving those over a broader base of stores, that's one of the things that we think is going to give us incremental fuel for the engine to continue to invest in the 4 keys. Operator : The next question comes from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : I have 2 questions related to deflation. First, I wanted to get a sense of what you guys are assuming for deflation or inflation this year and whether you expect to return to positive growth or positive prices later this year. And then secondly, related to that, we're hearing more and more announcements, whether it's Target, Walmart and others, just talking more about price investments. Do you expect, I guess, the deflationary impact of competitor actions to be potentially more this year than what you've seen in recent years? J. Schlotman: Yes. I think you're doing what a lot of people do, including this morning when I was on CNBC of mixing inflation and deflation at cost and retail. When we talk about our inflation or deflation, it's our product cost inflation or deflation. You kind of threw in what's going to happen to retail product cost inflation or deflation. Overall, we do think that we'll return to a slightly inflationary environment in the back half of the year. It is interesting to note that despite the fact that we pretty much had, I think Rodney was talking even before we went on the call, it's 9 quarters in a row of deflation. W. McMullen: Of declining. J. Schlotman: Of declining. W. McMullen: Inflation/deflation. J. Schlotman: Either inflation coming down or actual deflation, it's 9 straight quarters now that, that trend line would be down. So it's been obviously fairly persistent. Despite that, even though we had a lot lower pharmacy inflation in the quarter, that still generated a very large LIFO charge. It was offset by other areas that had deflation. So it's a completely mixed bag. Even in the fourth quarter, grocery inflation over the course of the quarter was basically half of what it was in the third quarter. But produce inflation went up 600 basis points or deflation expanded by 600 basis points. It was over 7% deflationary in the quarter. So it's a huge mixed bag of what's out there, and I'm not going to pinpoint an exact number because I've proven over the years that I can predict a totally inaccurate number on inflation or even LIFO. But we continue to manage through the process that we have. W. McMullen: As we mentioned in our prepared comments, we do expect the market to get more competitive. We've assumed that for a long period of time. We continue to see great opportunities for process change in taking costs out of the business. And the last couple of calls, I've mentioned that we're definitely down on those. In the fourth quarter, we made more progress on those than we did in the third quarter, and you can begin to see some of those things paying some fruit. As Mike mentioned, we're starting to cycle actual deflation. We think the first part of the year will still look an awful lot like third and fourth quarter. But once you get to third quarter, you start cycling some of those strong deflationary numbers and wouldn't see it. The other thing that I think is important to note, if you look at cost of goods, there's all kinds of things that we are doing to finance and pay for some of that through cost of goods savings and other pieces of the business as well. Operator : The next question comes from Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley. Vincent Sinisi : Just wanted to see, with the promotional environment, any further color on kind of promotions by categories? Is it fair to say that the kind of the most deflationary is also getting the most promotions? And then also in -- just in relation to that, if you could give any further color around kind of the comp cadence expected, in addition to the very helpful EPS guidance by quarter. W. McMullen: Yes. On the promotions by category, we would use our 84.51\u00b0 insights for that, and it would really be different by customer. Some of it would be things that you would do personalized one-on-one. So it actually -- and if you go into the store from checking the retail price, you wouldn't see it because its offers that are made directly to customers, some via coupons. It's all of the above because different customers react different ways to different promotions. So it's becoming an increasingly personalized offers based on what that particular customer wants and desires are, and it would be a mix of national brand, Corporate Brands and fresh product and others, so it's really a mix.  On the comp by quarter, Mike, I'll let you... J. Schlotman: Yes. If you'd repeat your question, I want to make sure I'm answering the question you asked and not what I have in my head. Vincent Sinisi : Yes. Sure, Mike. Just wondering if you could kind of give us, in relation to your full year ID sales guidance, how you're thinking about that on a quarterly basis. Maybe -- if any color around kind of where things are now and/or just how you're kind of thinking about that as we go forward each quarter. J. Schlotman: Well, the comment about we expect the first quarter to look a lot like the first quarter, I guess, would be a little bit of code for ID sales continue to be a little bit negative right now, which means we expect ID sales to recover as we go throughout the year. And that's going back to the questions that we've gotten on the cadence of how we expect to see the underlying EPS as that is predicated on an improvement in ID sales throughout the year. Vincent Sinisi : Okay. Perfect. And if I could just get a quick follow up in there. Just any updates worth highlighting with your partnership with Lucky's? J. Schlotman: Sure. Bo and his team out there in Colorado continue to do some exciting things inside their stores. Some of the new stores, they've opened. We're pretty excited about the sales levels that they've been able to generate. Bo continues to look at his book of business in his stores, and they're a very new company. He's learning as he goes, and he continue to make tweaks to his model and stopped doing some things that aren't working and try some new things that seem to have -- to be bearing fruit. But we're very pleased with what we see out of Bo and his team and continue to be enthusiastic about that kind of a format. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Kenneth Goldman : The 70 basis point headwind from removing some of these high-performing stores from the ID sales base, I'm just trying to figure out. I don't think you've divulged that number in the past very often. Maybe you have, and I missed it. But how does that compare to what you saw in recent years? I'm just trying to figure it out. Is it unusually high impact, because you didn't do necessarily more relocations than you normally did? So was it just that the stores were so much better and taking them out of the base just hadn't that much more of an impact? Or maybe 70 basis points is similar to what you normally experienced. Just trying to get a sense there. J. Schlotman: It's not something we've talked about a whole lot, and it's one of those things when you -- if you have 3% or 4% IDs and you have a strong capital program and it's 30 or 40 or 50 basis points of headwinds from sister store impacts, the effect of that isn't as dramatic as it is when you're close to a 0 ID sales negative. So we haven't really talked about it. We did in the third quarter -- what did I say? 20 to 30 basis points. W. McMullen: Is what it typically is. J. Schlotman: Is what it typically is. So it is a bit higher today because we have been doing more stores. A couple of 3 years ago, we were under $3 billion in capital, and we were above $3.5 billion in capital this year. So we have ramped up our capital spend. We are touching more stores. We're opening more new stores, which caused a sister store impact and expanding and relocating some very strong stores, which continue to perform very well but haven't been brand reopened long enough to be into our identical store base yet. Kenneth Goldman : So that's helpful. Just to clarify, so it sounds like incrementally, I think -- it is rough, I know, but you're talking 40, 50 basis points of a headwind versus what you normally experience from this effect, and... J. Schlotman: And when you look at the number of stores we did over the last year compared to 2 or 3 years ago, it's about double, major store projects. Kenneth Goldman : So then, looking ahead, is it safe to assume we will still see roughly a 70 basis point impact over the next 3 quarters or so? And then how do we think about that in years beyond? Is that -- is this an unusual effect? Or do you continue to think that you're maybe just again, generally going to be relocating, expanding some of your higher-performing stores in the future? J. Schlotman: Well, as those stores are open long enough, they will flip back into our ID store base, and we would hope they continue to perform the way they are and be a tailwind to ID sales. And as I said in the prepared comments, we are taking capital down from what we would originally plan to spend in 2017 because we've been guiding folks to think about 2017 and even '18 to be a similar spend level that we did in '16. And most of that will come out of new store and will continue a strong remodel program. So when we remodel a store, it does not come out of IDs. It's only an expansion or a relocation or a net new that winds up affecting it. Kenneth Goldman : Right. I meant relocation. So just to clarify, Mike, though, is it not -- is it reasonable to assume that sort of 70-ish basis point headwind will continue for the next 4 -- few, 3 quarters or so? J. Schlotman: I think it'll continue for a while, but it'll decline over time as those stores become identical again. Operator : The next question comes from Shane Higgins of Deutsche Bank. Shane Higgins : Yes. I just want to get a better understanding of the cadence of your tonnage growth and your nonfuel IDs during the fourth quarter. If you guys could just kind of talk about what happened after early December when you guys were seeing or expecting trends to be slightly positive. Just want to try to get some color there. W. McMullen: If you look at during the quarter, it started out slow when we had the earnings call. It actually during the holidays improved. And in January, it slowed down again. So if you look at during the quarter, that's kind of a cadence within the quarter. I always hate to use weather as an excuse, but we had absolutely no weather benefits this year. Now the negative of that was we had no weather benefits. The positive is next year, if we have any weather at all, we cycle that. J. Schlotman: Yes. And if you look at the prior year, we didn't have much weather either. And in fact, the only one big weather event we had was the last weekend of the year in last year's numbers. So our year ended against the only weather event we had in the prior year with no weather this year. W. McMullen: Yes. And then tonnage growth cadence remained positive, but it's because of the deflation. But obviously, around the holidays is stronger than the 2 sides of the holiday. Shane Higgins : Okay. And then just, Rodney, back to your earlier comments that you guys were a bit more aggressive on your pricing and promotions during the quarter, was that kind of a decision based on some of the insights that you're getting from your customers that you decided to make greater investments in price versus maybe investing in other areas of the store? And were those concentrated in any specific regions in response to the competitive environment out there? Just any color there would be great. W. McMullen: Yes. Very -- they were very broad-based. And anything like -- anything that we would do, we would use our insights to decide what our approach is. Operator : The next question comes from Alvin Concepcion of Citi. Alvin Concepcion : Just a follow-up on the competitive environment. I think you mentioned earlier you're seeing it from competitors running better stores. What about in the form of pricing or promotions? Are you seeing major changes there since the quarter ended? W. McMullen: I wouldn't say changes since the quarter ended. I would say that we definitely are seeing some pricing in certain pockets. I've never tried to calculate it on a percentage basis, but any point in time, you will always have competitors doing things from a pricing standpoint. Alvin Concepcion : Great. And just a follow-up on some things about your delivery initiatives. You mentioned you'll be expanding Uber in 2017. Wondering if you could speak to that? Is that something that's been driving incremental sales and profitability? And how many stores are covered by Uber at this point in time? And how many do you expect in the future? W. McMullen: Yes. Well, it's a pretty small test. We're early in the process. And the same comment that I made earlier about -- on ClickList, it's a headwind, but you can see, as they mature, it becomes where we're neutral in terms of how customer engages with us. In terms of specific numbers that we would expect for this year, we're not to the point where we'd be willing to share it other than obviously, we're working hard to scale it if it makes sense in ways that it makes sense. Alvin Concepcion : If I could sneak one in, just related to that, Vitacost, it sounds like you've expanded it with Simple Truth. Just wondering about your future plans to expand beyond Simple Truth into other categories? And is this a preferred delivery method versus Uber? W. McMullen: Well, we would look at all the delivery options together and really leaving it up to customer how they want to engage with us. We'll continue to add items to Vitacost that make sense, and the Simple Truth product is obviously the initial part of that. Operator : The next question comes from Robbie Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Robert Ohmes : Just 2 quick things. Thanks for the color on the first quarter trends to date. And I was just curious or maybe, Rodney, can you remind us, do delayed tax refunds, are they having an impact on your business? And maybe give us some history on that. And then I have a follow-up question. W. McMullen: Yes. On the delayed tax refund, I don't know, Mike. I really don't have very much insight into it. If you look, most of our products aren't as discretionary as some of the other retailers that have talked about it. J. Schlotman: And Robbie, I would be in Rodney's boat from an insight standpoint. My conclusion, without meeting with some other folks and having a conversation, would be that the timing of those doesn't affect us in a big way like it does other folks because over my time here at Kroger, I've never heard anybody talk about I can't wait till tax refunds drop, so we can get a boost in sales. So it just doesn't -- I agree with what Rodney's conclusion, it's based on what most of what we sell. W. McMullen: Yes. And the only exception would be like in Alaska where you get paid to live in Alaska, and it's based on the size of the check, based on fuel profits or gasoline profits for the state. J. Schlotman: From the pipeline. W. McMullen: From the pipeline. And that, you can clearly see when the checks go out and the size of the checks. J. Schlotman: And they're year-to-year. But those are all great big Fred Myer stores with a lot of general merchandise. Robert Ohmes : Got it. That's helpful. Then just the other question, the Roundy's integration, can you just give us maybe more update on that? And was it a drag to the fourth quarter? And when could Roundy's become a year-over-year sort of tailwind for you guys? J. Schlotman: Well, if you look at the -- if you look at Roundy's overall, we continue to be very happy with what Michael Marx and team are doing in Wisconsin as well as Don Rosanova and team in Chicagoland with the 2 banners. Mike and team have cycled through the first set of store remodels and offerings to the customers. They're now the second market getting remodels completed, and then we'll put a full campaign in that market. And then if we continue to see the positive reaction from the customers from ID sales dollars and units, we would expect to continue to roll that out throughout the state. From an ID sales standpoint, it really didn't affect it very much in the quarter, certainly not as much as it did earlier in the year. Operator : The next question comes from Ed Kelly of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Edward Kelly : Yes. Rodney, could we start, I just have a big-picture question I mean, if we think back over the years at the analyst meetings that you have had, you used to put up a slide showing the gap between your ID growth and your peers, highlighting, well, it's really been very remarkable, consistent share gains. And as we think about the fourth quarter now and you think about the results that some other players are putting up, specifically Walmart, is a good example, it just doesn't seem like that type of share gain is continuing. And I just wanted to get your thoughts on why you think this momentum's changed and importantly, how is it impacting the way that you're thinking about strategy and specifically the cadence around price investments going forward. W. McMullen: Yes. Well, I'll answer the question a little broader than just one specific competitor. But with the comment that I made earlier, there is no doubt, several competitors are improving and running better stores. So that is really clear when you go into their stores, and it's much broader than just Walmart. In terms of the things that we're doing, we're really doubling down on the customer experience. We're getting even more aggressive on process change and taking costs out where it makes sense to take costs out and improving the competitiveness of our model. So it's -- in terms of what are we doing about it, those would be the things that we're doing about it because what we find is certain customers are interested in price, but all they want is a fair price. They're really, really interested in having fresh produce, fresh meat and a great experience, and those are things that we have competitive advantages on. And we'll continue to focus on that, and our store teams and our folks, our associates across the whole company will continue to focus on those. Edward Kelly : As we think about the industry now going forward, it certainly seems like the next 5 years could certainly be more challenging than the last 5. Just given what we're hearing from competitors around what they're doing from a pricing perspective, you've talked about players being better at actually just running stores. We've got online to deal with. We've got hard discount to deal with. Do you think that it makes sense that the industry could enter another wave of consolidation? And how are you thinking about M&A versus organic store growth now from here? W. McMullen: The -- well, if you look, we would -- I've been around for 30-some years, and I always would tell you that we've always felt that the next 5 years are going to be more competitive than the last 5. I would definitely agree with that comment today. We definitely believe the next 5 will be more competitive than the last 5 because only the strong survive. If you look at in terms of -- we feel very excited about the opportunities that we have to continue to grow our business. And I put it in 2 buckets. Some of it is operational driven where if you look at the historical business that we're in, getting better at that. But if you think about the comments that we -- you hear us increasingly talk about, looking at the opportunity in the $1.5 trillion total food business, we continue to get more and more aggressive in terms of fresh food, fresh food prepared, what's for dinner and picking things up, and that continues to grow well for us. So we really see that, that continues to be a large growth opportunity, and I would say, at the moment, we can see the opportunity more than the things that we're doing. When we were -- when you're out for our Investor Meeting, you saw some of the things we're testing, but we really continue to improve and get better and better about that part of the business. And one of the things that we've been very pleasantly surprised is the willingness that our customers are to eat at one of our stores, and we believe that, that will be an opportunity to grow the business and create a new leg, a platform for growth. So it's really both of those things together. Edward Kelly : And M&A, any more or less important for you going forward, do you think? W. McMullen: I would say it's kind of the same. If the right opportunity became available, we would be very interested. But we don't -- we haven't changed in terms of we design a model where M&A is not required. And if the right opportunity becomes available, we would sit down and talk to somebody. But it's not something that we're out proactively trying to change that. Operator : Our last question comes from Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research. Charles Cerankosky : My question was previously asked, so I'll pass it on to someone else. Operator : Our last question goes to Kelly Bania of BMO Capital. Kelly Bania : Just wanted to ask a couple of questions about volume as of late. I think there's been -- our industry data and a lot of industry data seems to suggest some pretty weak volumes, and I think a lot of that data's skewed towards center store categories. But I'm just curious what your assessment is if you feel like you're seeing any similar surprisingly weakness in volume, particularly quarter-to-date. And if you think it has anything to do with channel shifting or changing consumer behavior or just maybe a result of this prolonged deflationary environment. W. McMullen: Well, yes, we continue to see very much where people are increasingly spending money in the fresh departments. So there is no doubt there's a shift in tonnage from the center store to the perimeter of the store, and that's been a long-term shift. And that hasn't changed. If you look at the center store, we would still see tonnage growth there. But remember, natural and organic is part of what's driving that growth, and natural and organic is not -- there's very few public companies where you can just see that by itself. And if you look at even for us, Mike talked about our total natural and organic business at about $16 billion. Our Simple Truth brand by itself is $1.7 billion of that, so over 10%, and those are things that you really don't see in some of the other measures. So the center store has been soft for a long period of time, but we've continued to gain share in the center store, and we also have continued to change the mix of what's inside the center store. J. Schlotman: And different category reinventions with coffee and pet and baby where we've totally redone the look and feel of those departments for our customer. Kelly Bania : Got it. That's helpful, and then, I guess, just lastly, the shift to IRI, is there any reason or anything you can tell us about kind of making that shift from Nielsen to IRI? J. Schlotman: Well, we announced earlier in the year a new relationship with IRI that we didn't talk about a whole lot, and it's really just furthering that relationship with them. And they have a few nuggets of data that Nielsen may not have that we think is going to be helpful to us overall as we look at our volume in the overall food industry, not just the grocery store industry. W. McMullen: Before we end today's call, I'd like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in today. Thank you for continuing to connect with our customers every day. They are rewarding us with their business. With your help, we gained more of the market and improved our customer satisfaction scores in 2016. Thank you for your hard work. For those associates who are choosing to accept the voluntary retirement offer, thank you for your contributions to Kroger. I know for some the decision to retire was not an easy one. You should know Kroger would not be the company it is today without your years of dedicated service. Each of you has made a difference in the lives of our customers, our communities and each other, and we are very grateful for all of your contributions. Thank you.  That completes our call today. Thanks for joining. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a great day.",

[Operator Instructions] Please also note, today's event is being recorded. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Kate Ward, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead. Kate Ward : Thanks, Jamie. Good morning, and thank you for joining us.  Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements.  We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially.  A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our first quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen W. McMullen: Thank you, Kate. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me to review Kroger's first quarter 2017 results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman. As we all know, there is a lot of change in the food retail industry, both in terms of the operating environment and the competitive landscape. The best thing that we can do is to stay on the offense by continuing to focus on our customers, what they want and need today and what we anticipate they will want and need tomorrow, and executing our strategy. We continue to manage our business for the long term and to deliver earnings growth on a 3 to 5-year time horizon. We are making meaningful investments in our digital and online growth. We believe that customers of the future will want to shop with us for anything, anytime and anywhere. In the first quarter, we saw more than 30% growth in new digital customers and a more than 30% increase in digital visits, with faster growth in mobile compared to last year. We are also building on our personalization expertise to benefit our customers. An example of this is My Magazine, which delivers personalized content like recipes to loyal households based on their shopping behavior and interests. In fact, we delivered more than 6 million unique My Magazine offers in the first quarter alone. This also allows us to offer personalized lower prices to our loyal households in addition to low prices everyone can see. This is another example of how we leverage 84.51\u00b0's expertise. We are investing in our people. We are improving customer service by both increasing labor hours in certain areas and increasing starting wages in certain markets. Taken together, these steps will improve the customer experience and improve retention. I share these examples to demonstrate that we are laser-focused on providing our customers with the right value proposition. This is our Customer 1st promise, our commitment to provide friendly service, fresh foods and low prices every day, and this is what we will continue to do regardless of the external factors because it's what our customers deserve, and we know, ultimately, that delivers shareholder value. These investments both maintain and enhance our position in our markets. And while it is still early in 2017, we are starting to see some traction. We are happy with the better identical sales trends in this first quarter compared to the fourth quarter, and we are pleased to see that our current identical sales trends is positive. The last 9 weeks of the first quarter were positive, and so are our second quarter to date. Our teams continue to innovate in new and exciting ways that reflect where our customers are going. Recognizing the demand for convenience, high quality and best value, Kroger's culinary development team watched an incredible collection of Prep + Pared meal kits that we are currently piloting in Cincinnati stores. We can hardly keep them on the shelves, and it's easy to see why as soon as you try them. Kroger\u2019s Prep + Pared meal kits offer restaurant-quality meals that are easy to cook in about 20 minutes. We think customers will love knowing that they're available in their stores when they are wondering along about 2 :00 in the afternoon what's for dinner. Our brands are one of the primary means we have to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. Last year, we commissioned an independent third party to conduct research that would give us an objective view of how our customers view our brands. This included blind taste tests with national brands and other private-label foods. Our research showed that the most loved brands sold in our stores are our brands, above even the national brands. And in the blind taste test, our brands outperformed competitive national brands and other private-label products almost 100% of the time. Our products in Private Selection, Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic brands rated significantly above their respective competitive offerings. Of course, our journey is never done. So our customers will continue to see rising quality and better value on our brand products in the future. By having brands our customers love that are only available from us, we gain loyalty and advocacy from our customers. Our brands represented approximately 28% of total units sold and 25.6% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy during the first quarter. Our customer needs are constantly changing. What doesn't change is the desire for welcoming customer experience with an abundant variety of food available when and how they want it all at a great value. That's why we regularly evolve the execution of our Customer 1st strategy, while the core strategy itself doesn't change. Too often, American consumers have to make a choice between low prices and a great experience, compromising one for the other. Kroger is uniquely situated to eliminate the need for the compromise, serving customers who are hungry for more than food, who want to be nourished in ways that help them live their lives best. Kroger's purpose is to Feed the Human Spirit, and we are more confident than ever that by living our purpose and delivering our Customer 1st promise, we'll deliver long-term shareholder value that you can count on. We remain committed to delivering our long-term net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 8% to 11% plus a growing dividend. And here is Mike to go into more details on our first quarter results. Mike? J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Like Rodney said, we were glad to see the better results compared to the fourth quarter for identical food store sales, and for the second quarter to date, our ID sales are positive. Tonnage continued to be positive during the first quarter. We continue to focus on the areas of highest growth like natural and organic products as well as areas where we are serving -- saving customers time such as ready-to-eat and ready-to-eat meal solutions. Visits per household were flat in the first quarter. Basket size and price per unit were down, but those were offset by household growth. Loyal households grew 3.2% compared to last year's first quarter and our loyal households had positive ID sales growth in the first quarter. In the first quarter, our gross margin was down, operating costs were up and FIFO operating profit was down. While this is not representative of our typical expectations, it is important to keep in mind that we're making very deliberate and targeted investments in line with our Customer 1st Strategy. As Rodney outlined earlier, we have made conscious decisions to increase starting wages in certain markets to improve associate engagement and retention that will create a better experience for our customers. We continue to invest and grow our digital business. Our digital revenue more than doubled in the first quarter compared to last year. This includes revenue from ClickList, Harris Teeter's ExpressLane and Vitacost.com. As we continue to invest in price, we also remind you, Kroger's investment in price can be seen very clearly if you look at gross margins in the early 2000s compared to today. Kroger has invested more than $3.8 billion to lower prices for our customers over that time period. We have no intention of giving up the momentum we've gained on low prices. These investments enable us to connect with our customers in a deeper way and increase our market share over time. We are pleased that Kroger's market share, as traditionally calculated, was up in the first quarter. That said, we recognize there is no perfect metric for capturing market share. We are doing a lot of work to better define or perhaps redefine the market as a share of stomach rather than share among traditional grocery stores. We see food as a massive $1.5 trillion market and we have a substantial growth opportunity in that market. I also want to stress that we're committed to lowering costs as a rate of sales. Many of the things we are doing to pull costs out of the business today set us up for savings in the future. We will only further intensify our process improvement efforts. Now for an update on retail fuel. In the first quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.171 compared to $0.143 in the same quarter last year. The average retail price of fuel was $2.28 versus $1.92 in the same quarter last year. Our net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.33x compared to 2.12x during the same period last year. This resolve (sic) [ result ] is due to the merger with ModernHEALTH and the repurchase of shares. Over the last 4 quarters, Kroger has used free cash flow to repurchase $1.5 billion in common shares, paid $438 million in dividends, invest $3.4 billion in capital and merged with ModernHEALTH for approximately $390 million. The flexibility to return value to shareholders is a core strength of our financial strategy.  We are committed to balancing the use of cash to maintain our current investment-grade rating. Return on invested capital for the first quarter on a rolling 4-quarters basis was 12.75%. On the labor relations front, we are currently negotiating agreements with the UFCW for store associates in Atlanta, Dallas and our Food 4 Less warehouse stores in Southern California. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive cost and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by rising health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors don't face. Kroger continues to communicate with our local unions, which represent many of our associates, the importance of growing Kroger's business and profitability, which will help us create more jobs, incur opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. Turning now to our guidance for fiscal 2017. We have previously indicated that the environment during the first half of this year would be similar to the back half of 2016, and that is what we are seeing. As Rodney said, there is a lot of change in the retail food industry. That, coupled with the transition from deflation to inflation, creates a challenging operating environment. The deflationary environment was less severe in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter, coming in at 20 basis points deflationary without fuel. Grocery was essentially flat during the quarter, but had fluctuations up and down during it. Meat continued its deflationary trends. And produce, while deflationary for the quarter, showed inflation in the last 4 weeks of the quarter, and pharmacy was inflationary. As a result, we increased our expectations for LIFO to $80 million, a $55 million increase over our initial expectations. We have also made some incremental investments in price in certain markets that had very hot features on milk and eggs. While this affects gross margin in the short term, it is less expensive than regaining a customer's loyalty later on. These 2, plus the incremental investments in hours and wages, are the primary factors causing us to lower our guidance for the year. Our GAAP net earnings per diluted share guidance for 53 weeks is now $1.74 to $1.79. Our adjusted net earnings guidance range is $2 to $2.05. The previous adjusted net earnings guidance range was $2.21 to $2.25. See the Form 8-K we filed this morning for additional information on guidance. Because this is an unusual year, we're going to provide a quarterly cadence relative to last year rather than compare it to our long-term guidance rate as we've done in the past. For net earnings per diluted share, we expect the second quarter to be down compared to last year, the third quarter to be up slightly compared to last year and the fourth quarter to be flat excluding the 53rd week. We continue to expect identical supermarket sales, excluding fuel, to be flat to 1% growth for 2017, and we continue to expect capital investments excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to be in the $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion range for 2017. Over the long term, we remain committed to achieving a net earnings per diluted share growth rate of 8% to 11% plus a growing dividend. Now I'll turn it back to Rodney. W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike. We are making the investments necessary to continue being the best food retailer in the country. We know there is a lot of upheaval in the food retail industry. Our strategy is to focus on our customers. As their wants and needs change, we'll be right there with them. We are confident that we will continue winning with our people, our food and the customer experience, and we will not lose on price. Now we look forward to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : So guys, just to start off, if you think -- is there any way to quantify, maybe directionally, the investments in labor, in SG&A versus the investments in price? Labor being some multiples of the investment in price or maybe it's equally split. And then when you think about the investments in price, is a lot of that proactive on your part? You talked about dairy. Or is that more reactive given what competition is doing? W. McMullen: I'll start, and Mike, just fill in. On the mix between labor and price as you look forward, I would think it's probably pretty close to 50-50, plus or minus 10%. In terms of price, there would be -- as you know, we would not be leading on price as a strategy, but we're not going to let somebody have price. Now if you look at some of the competitive changes and what we see going on in those situations, we would be proactive versus reactive. And then Mike, anything you want to add to both of those comments? J. Schlotman: No, I absolutely agree. And the whole trick here, John, is just how quickly the lines cross and our price investment create more gross profit margin dollars. And as we said in the prepared remarks, there's really 2 things relative to the labor. One is adding some hours to certain service departments, as well as increasing starting wages, which we believe over time will reduce our turnover, which has a great payback when we can have a higher retention of our associates who then are more productive and give a better shopping experience. So that one has a little bit longer runway relative to when we see the benefits of those investments. John Heinbockel : And then as a follow-up, if you think about what's different versus March, is it primarily the cadence of reflation? And then as you think about -- because it does sound like you do expect higher inflation this year than you had before, you didn't reflect that in your comp. Is that just higher cost inflation offset by price investments gets you kind of to a 0 net impact from that? W. McMullen: Yes. The biggest thing, if you look in terms of anticipation of identical sales going forward and the improvement of that, we would expect that improvement will continue, but the improvement will be a little bit slower than what we had expected. From an inflation standpoint, Mike went into a little bit of detail on LIFO, but that would be a big chunk. Obviously, the change in LIFO affected, I think -- what, Mike, about $0.04 a share as well. J. Schlotman: Yes. Kind of around $0.035, $0.04, in that range. John, it's not necessarily that it's dramatically different today than we were expecting. But when we look forward based on the movements we're seeing in the underlying commodities, we do think there could be a little more inflation by the end of the year than we originally thought. But the accounting convention is whatever your year-end estimate is, you expense that ratably throughout the year. So it's really more reflective of where we think the end of the year is going to be, not necessarily what would happen in the first quarter, but we're required to ratably expense that over the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Karen Short from Barclays. Karen Short : A couple of questions. I guess in general, since you're taking the opportunity to lower guidance, I guess I have 2 questions. One is, why not take the opportunity to widen the range to give yourself a little more wiggle room? But I guess more importantly, why wouldn't you lower guidance more? Because if I look at your revised guidance, I still would say this seems pretty optimistic, especially given the competitive landscape has only really just begun to heat up. And within your guidance, originally, there was some assumption that there would be operating expense opportunities, and it now sounds like that's off the table, which makes me even more confused about how we get to the full year numbers. J. Schlotman: We talked about all of those in deciding exactly where to set the guidance range. We spent a lot of time taking where we are today, looking at forecasts for the rest of the year, trying to understand the gives and takes, and settled on the $2 to $2.05. A wider range, perhaps we could have done that. I don't -- other than -- the only answer I have to that is we decided that we feel good about the range we've put out there. We do feel good about the traction we're getting in ID sales that we think will help us support that ID guidance range. Relative to the operating cost reductions, I think that -- I don't have any concern that we aren't going to continue to get the operating cost reductions we're getting. We have made an independent decision to add some service hours to some departments, as well as in some markets, increase starting wages to try to reduce the turnover we have, which hurts the customer experience as well as creates its own cost and friction when you're constantly hiring and training people. We didn't do that across the country, it's in select markets. But it's not an inexpensive proposition. So we try to factor all those in. In fact, what we call enabler savings are actually pretty close to tracking to exactly what we expected in total to save on our cost-savings initiatives for the year. W. McMullen: A couple of other things, Karen, too, and Mike and I both mentioned it. Our identical sales continue to improve, and we would expect that trend to continue. If you look at quarter-to-date and realize it's only 3 weeks plus a few days, we would be at higher than the midpoint of the range that we gave for the year, and that's continued to improve over the first quarter, and the first quarter was an improvement over the fourth quarter and it improved during the quarter. And then Mike's point on expenses, there were some items where it's more of a onetime type of expense item. If you look at some of the changes and the logistics in some other places, we would expect, as we get throughout the year, that some of the investments we've made, it'll flip. So you won't have the start-up costs. And then if you look at digital, obviously, you have a lot of start-up costs initially when you turn on digital in a store. And if you look at the maturity of those stores, over time, that becomes a headwind versus -- a tailwind versus a headwind. Karen Short : Okay. But just so I understand, in terms of the operating expenses reductions that you've identified, that -- we did not see any of that really in this quarter, but we will see more in the second, third and fourth? J. Schlotman: I would say we saw some in this quarter. And our -- what we have saved in the quarter and the runway -- run rate we have for the year is right in line with what our original expectation and our business plan is. There were other, as I said, the hours and the dollars investment in starting wages were something that was incremental to the plan, but we think it's proven to do that. We try to run the business dynamically and not sit back and say, \"Well, it's not in the plan. So even though we think it's good, we're not going to do it.\" And sometimes, those are pluses, and sometimes, those are minuses. The investments we made in milk and eggs did not lose the customers to people trying to draw our customers into the store. It was -- that, by itself, if milk and eggs were normal kinds of retails, then we probably would've had positive IDs in the first quarter, not negative, which also affected gross margins in the first quarter. So there's always gives and takes. But the thing we're trying to get across is we've made some conscious decisions to make incremental investments in our Customer 1st Strategy, plus the effect of a $0.04 higher LIFO charge. Operator : Our next question comes from Zach Fadem from Wells Fargo. Zachary Fadem : Is there any color you can provide on the ID sales impact from digital orders at this point? I believe you mentioned you doubled your digital sales. So when looking at your data, how are you thinking about what's incremental versus what might be coming at the expense of in-store volumes? W. McMullen: It's a great question, Zach, and it's one of those that's always hard to answer because you don't know what a customer would have done. The best we can tell, if you would give a range of between 40% to 60%, you're probably within that range. But it is a hard, hard number to guesstimate because you really don't know for sure. J. Schlotman: [ 60%. ] W. McMullen: Incremental or you would have gotten anyway, either way. Zachary Fadem : 40% to 60% incremental, you said? J. Schlotman: Yes. It is clear that those ClickList customers spend incremental dollars with us. To put your finger in the exact number, would they have grown their loyalty with us without ClickList? Perhaps. But you try to take the household trends as a whole and see where they've been going and where they are today. Zachary Fadem : And is it large enough to say that it's having a meaningful impact on the ID sales line yet? W. McMullen: Not when you look at the total. The cost of the start-up would be a lot more painful than the tailwind from it. But if -- as you know, when we merged with Harris Teeter, Harris Teeter had been doing it for 10 years. And when you look at the maturity that we're having with the Kroger versus the maturity that Harris Teeter had, the maturity would be very similar, but it's a headwind for a while. Zachary Fadem : Okay. And I also wanted to address the headlines around Aldi and Lidl. Conceptually, how do you think about the role of the hard discounters in the U.S. and how that compares relative to the U.K? And in your mind, what are the structural differences between the 2 markets that you'd call out? And given that, do you think that those guys would have the same competitive advantages here versus the U.K. market? Any thoughts on that? W. McMullen: Yes, Zach, I love the question. A couple of things, for sure. One, just obviously the sheer size of the countries are different. I think the biggest structural, I guess, 2 big structural differences, if you look at the cost that it takes to operate a supermarket in the U.S, it's meaningfully less than the U.K. If you look at the price spreads that they're able to achieve in the U.K. versus the U.S., the price spread isn't as much either. So you have, both from a cost standpoint and a retail advantage for the customer standpoint, not as big a spread. Also if you look at the base experience of a supermarket in the U.S, we would typically offer more services in terms of every store would have a butcher that's there, ready to help. The produce would be much more variety, fresher. So there's a lot of aspects from the experience standpoint that would be different in the U.S. than the U.K. as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Goldman from JPMorgan. Kenneth Goldman : Rodney, one of the first things you said, and I'll paraphrase, was that the environment for food retail has changed. So I guess, I'm curious. Why was it surprising, given that, to see these hot promotional prices on milk and eggs? Shouldn't that have been sort of expected given that the environment has changed? Or maybe you were talking about something different, which is why I'm asking the question. And I guess for my follow-up, I'm curious what is in your guidance in terms of what you're assuming for competitive pricing as we look ahead? Because if things do get worse, and as Karen Short was pointing out, they likely will in terms of competition, I just want to understand what you guys are thinking and how much that's factored into your numbers at this point. W. McMullen: Okay. In terms of the environment is changing, I wouldn't tie it directly to milk and eggs. To me, that's just one example. But as you know, people change -- are changing the way they eat, and we could -- and we're committed and we will support the customer in changing the way they eat. So if you think about the comments on Prep + Pared, if you think about the comments on digital and using where a customer can engage with us digitally or in-store, what we find is a customer does both. So it's all of those things together when I talk about the way customers are eating is changing. And we intend to be there and take care of the customer the way they change. In terms of guidance, Mike, I'll let you... J. Schlotman: Yes. Again, in response to Karen's question, you never know when somebody in select markets is going to run some hot feature and you have to make independent decisions as those features hit the street, because if somebody just run an ad for a couple of weeks trying to get some business in the store or they're going to do something longer term. And when those kinds of ads stay there for a little bit longer, particularly when it's 2 important commodities like milk and eggs, ultimately, we're going to react and not allow our customers to think they have to go somewhere else to get the best value for those kinds of products. It just so happens those 2 commodities are big, big commodities and it's expensive when hot features hit versus some other commodities. And to say we do or don't have something exactly built onto our business plan, that's difficult to say. But we did make the decision to react to those prices and to keep the customers inside of our stores. W. McMullen: It's our best guess in terms of what we see happening going forward in terms of at this point in time. Kenneth Goldman : Can I just sneak one quick one in to make sure I understand? Is the message then that -- and Mike and Rodney, that is helpful. But is the message that you can't really predict it, so you're not necessarily factoring in, as a general rule, more competitive prices? Or is the message maybe that you are, but it's harder to be that specific about it? J. Schlotman: I think we all believe that the industry's going to continue to get more competitive, because every year, it does get more competitive. I think the price investments that we've made so far, from our original pricing plan, are taking good hold and good effect. And we always build dollars in and -- to try to allow us to react to competitive pressures. So I don't -- I think the guidance, where we've lowered it to, certainly has some of both in it. Does it [ encompass ] everything that may happen? As Rodney said, it's our best guess at this point in time. Operator : Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Erica Eiler : This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. So I guess, should the environment remain challenging from here, can you maybe just talk about your flexibility to further reduce CapEx and perhaps redeploy the buybacks or other avenues to increase shareholder value? W. McMullen: As you know, from a capital investment standpoint, we continue to adjust, and over the last year, we've reduced the amount that we invest in store, increasingly invest, increase the amount we're spending from a digital standpoint and an infrastructure standpoint. We will always want to keep our stores up-to-date and fresh in terms of the 4 walls themselves. What we find is what the customer wants and needs are it's constantly changing. So some of the things that I talked about, we'll need to make changes in the store to support that. If we -- we would believe that we can continue to reduce the amount of capital we're spending if we're not getting a return on that capital. We would still be looking like -- looking at it like a hawk. In terms of every dollar we spend, are we getting a return for that dollar that we're spending? And over time, does that create value? If for some reason it doesn't, we would reduce -- we have continued to increase the focus on the infrastructure, digital and some of the other parts and deemphasized stores in terms of net new stores. I don't know Mike, anything you want to... J. Schlotman: I absolutely agree with that. Erica Eiler : Okay, that's helpful. And then just switching gears to private label. You talked quite a bit about private label in your prepared remarks. It seems that a lot of groceries out there are increasingly pushing private label lately. Some cases, select players are even lowering prices on private label. So are you at all seeing step-up efforts from the leading CPG players to support their products, whether it's through more promotional dollars or through other avenues? It just seems that there would be much more of a sense of urgency at this point, given what seems to be this increased retailer focus on private label. W. McMullen: Well, as you know, our brands has been incredibly important to Kroger since the founding of the company. And the research that we did last year, we wanted to make sure that we weren't just biased because we're so close to it, and we did the research with our customers. And our customers gave us glowing feedback on how strong our brands were, how great the products were in a blind panel. So they didn't know it was us. If you look at our Private Selection and Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic, we just crushed the competitors in that space. So for us, our brand has always been massively important, and we will have a world-class our brand approach. And it's important for our customers. It's important in terms of being able to make money as well. So we don't look at it in terms of trying to do something versus a CPG. We really look at it as our brand and building our brand and doing the things the customer wants. Operator : Our next question comes from Stephen Tanal from Goldman Sachs. Stephen Tanal : In sort of thinking through the cut to the guide, I'm curious to know how you're planning food margins for the balance of the year relative to Q1. Do you think the year-on-year gross margin pressure's bottomed? Or are you planning for that to get worse? J. Schlotman: Yes. I would say that when we look at gross margins overall, there's a variety of factors that wind up going into that. I think you'll continue to see us over time reduce gross margins. If you think about my prepared comments, over the last 12 or 14 years, we've taken $3.8 billion -- we've invested $3.8 billion in price by the drop we've made in gross margin. And I think over time, you'll continue to see it go down. It's typically what happens in any segment of retailing, to get laser focused on one particular year or one particular quarter. I probably wouldn't get that specific. But certainly, when you look at it over time, we built our business model assuming that gross margins will go down. We need stronger IDs than we've had the last few quarters. And we need to get back into the productivity loop of allowing our operating costs to come down as a rate of sales to grow that operating profit margin. Obviously, as I said in my prepared remarks, these aren't representative of the results we expect to deliver over time. But every once in a while, you run through cycles where you have to step back and adjust many of the metrics inside the company, and we feel that we've done a good job of reacting offensively and proactively to the environment around us, both from a labor standpoint, from a price investment standpoint and what makes sense to grow the business for the long term. Stephen Tanal : I guess 2 related sort of follow-up questions. The first would be the milk and eggs example. How widespread is that issue? And the second would be maybe qualitatively, as you think about the guidance and passing through the cost inflation that you're seeing, what's generally built in? Like how long are you sort of guiding so that you can hold the line on price longer than you think others will? Or is that a little different for any reason? J. Schlotman: Well, as Rodney said in response to an earlier question, we typically don't lead our market down on price, except in categories where it's one of our strategic investments we're making. You typically won't see us anymore -- maybe in the '90s, we did this, but you won't see the kind of reaction where we have very, very hot features that, in the end, don't drive any kind of loyalty in your store and just tries to drive foot traffic and get them to buy other things. Will we react to those types of things and make investments so that they don't attract any of our customers to their stores? Absolutely, we will. But I think if you look over time, we'll continue to be proactive on how we make the investments. Stephen Tanal : Okay, fair enough. And just lastly on meal kits. I know it was about 4 stores some weeks ago. How fast is that being rolled out? How fast can it be rolled out? And if you'd give us a feel for how incremental the sales are, maybe how you're pricing it versus kind of the group of ingredients in those kits, that would be helpful as well. W. McMullen: Yes. A great question that I won't get into all the specifics, because obviously, competitors would appreciate that knowledge as well. What we're finding is the quality of that meal is the same as going to a restaurant and getting a meal, but people like to prepare something at home, and they find it easy and they love the variety that we offer. So a lot of the price comparisons is what the price is versus going to a restaurant, but being able to do it at home. And when it takes you 20 minutes, it's just as fast as picking it up at Kroger's than it's going to a restaurant and going through all that hassle when you're at a restaurant. And we're getting great feedback. We'll continue to roll it out based on the ability for the facilities to handle the volume. And so far, it's been very good, and we appreciate, and looking forward to where it goes. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : I just wanted to kind of like broaden it out a little bit and try to understand kind of where you guys think your business is. And I heard Mike talking about gross margin pressure. As we look at the market, it seems like it's almost like the headline would be more Amazon moving into consumables, more Walmart price investments, more Walmart click-and-collect, more Aldi, more Lidl. And so with this natural pressure on gross margins, there's also seemingly a natural pressure on cost. And so as you look forward, I know you guys kind of reiterated your 11 -- 8% to 11% EPS growth rate. I'm just trying to understand over a number of years, how that's going to be possible in this environment? And do you need to make more aggressive, more offensive moves here with the business given this environment? W. McMullen: It's really making sure that we're using the advantages we have. Obviously, the data that we have, our average customer only has to drive a mile to get to one of our stores. So it's using that personalization to connect with the customer directly on a one-on-one basis and having where they can engage with us any way they want to. So if they want to pick up their groceries, if they want it delivered or if they want to shop and go the old-fashioned way, for lack of a better word, we continue to add services. And all of those services is part of the model in terms of making it an easy place to stop. So if you think about fuel and some of the others. So it's really the sum of all those pieces together that we're offering, and we're doing it in a seamless way. So it's -- I don't disagree with the more, more, more, but there's also things that are a huge advantage for us. And when you look at all those things, when a customer comes into our stores, we still give them a great experience on a friendly face, we have incredibly fresh product, and it's important for us to continue to improve on those aspects because that's what will be a point of difference. Scott Mushkin : So then my follow-up question would be regarding scale. Does Kroger have enough scale, in your minds, to compete in this environment against the likes of Walmart and Amazon, which are just -- produce tremendous amounts of cash, both companies. So I was wondering, as you look at the business, obviously, you're a large company, but a lot of investments need to be made. Do you need more scale? W. McMullen: Yes. From everything, from our perspective, we would have plenty of scale. And certainly $115 billion revenue company, we would have the scale. The other thing is if you look at like our own brands, the strength of our own brands and the strength of the experience the customers enjoy. All those things, obviously, add to that scale as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Andrew Wolf from Loop Capital Markets. Andrew Wolf : So I just want to clarify. You did say tonnage was positive, but if you just take out the inflation or the deflation rate, it looks like it might've slowed sequentially. J. Schlotman: I didn't catch the first part of your question. The what was... W. McMullen: Tonnage. Andrew Wolf : Your tonnage. I just want to know if the tonnage has slowed. And if so -- tonnage growth. You said tonnage growth is positive. But just given the numbers you provide us, it looks as if it slowed sequentially. Just want to confirm that? And then ask you... J. Schlotman: I'm not going to get into -- we typically don't give exact tonnage numbers. And if you look at ID sales compared to inflation, deflation, you get really skewed results when you try to add those 2 numbers together because of the mix of product that wind up being inside of those categories. When you have inflation in certain categories and deflation in other categories, it's not necessarily an apples-to-apples comparison. Just stepping back from exact tonnage and things like that, when you have the number of loyal households we have and you add 3.2% growth on the loyal households and your ID sales with your loyal households is on a positive trend, those are all great signs of health for our business over time. Without giving the -- we're very happy with our unit growth in the first quarter, let's just stay with that. Andrew Wolf : Okay, great. Last quarter, you said whatever -- the market share growth, at least as you've given it out annually, was a little less than '16 than it had been in prior years. What I'm really trying to get to is in the last quarter, you said it was more store-based -- your traditional store base competitors running better stores. And meanwhile, you're talking more about a changing environment. So I just want to check in with you. Is that still what mainly you see as creating a heightened competitive environment here? Or is it starting to be, as Scott was alluding to, what's going on digitally, whether it's Amazon or other offers? W. McMullen: Estimating market share, as you know, is always difficult. But the -- our growth in the first quarter, certainly on the analysis, would indicate that our market share growth in the first quarter was better than the fourth quarter. And as Mike said, we're pleased with what our unit growth was, we're pleased with our improvement in trend and we're pleased with the improvement in market share trends as well. J. Schlotman: And the loyal household growth. Andrew Wolf : Great. Well, that's encouraging. Do you want to comment on whether -- where you're seeing competitive -- it's obvious, new entrants coming into market, but some of them are store-based folks like Lidl and Aldi, and some are online like Amazon. So just in terms of what you're reacting to and so forth, or how you see things in the future, where do you -- what is your perspective? Is it still going to be a store-based competitive landscape? Or do you see being digital, including perhaps home delivery with certain click and collect, more of Kroger's future, really what you're stepping up to. W. McMullen: Yes. If you look, we really see the customer -- all our strategies and things are where do we anticipate the customer going. Everything that we could see and see, and doing what we're building our infrastructure for is to be able to serve the customer the way they want to be served. And everything that we can see, we find that the customer likes the combination of everything versus just one approach. And we continue to partner with third-party on doing deliveries. We have that in a couple of markets and we continue to expand that. We continue to expand the number of items that are offered. And obviously, we continue to expand the number of ClickList ExpressLane stores we have. But everything that we can see, the customer wants to shop on their terms the way they want to, but they still, for certain items, like to come into a physical store because they like to interact with people. And we think it's incredibly important to continue to have a strong physical presence, but it's the sum of all parts rather than just each one individually. Andrew Wolf : I just want to follow up, if I could, on the regional price, the hot pricing in dairy. Could you tell us what regions? Is that more in the East where -- is it proactive to Lidl's entry more so than not? And just generally, how widespread that is. J. Schlotman: Yes, I won't to comment on exactly where we sell those, other than it was not concentrated only there. Operator : Our next question comes from Vincent Sinisi from Morgan Stanley. Vincent Sinisi : Wanted to just go back to the pricing philosophy. Obviously, it'd been talked about a lot, but I think warranted given the fact that for investors today, probably the line that jumped out most within the release was, we will not lose on price. So you talked about obviously being certainly a part of that is proactive. I'm sure some of it in given markets is reactive. But can you just give us a little bit better sense on kind of the true kind of philosophy around balancing that kind of strict price versus, obviously, a lot of the other factors that Kroger has going for it and kind of who that may be kind of most aimed after, that'd be great. W. McMullen: Yes. I think it's important for people not to overplay the price comment. As you know, we do a ton of work on understanding where the customer wants and needs are, and we're incredibly focused on differentiating our experience versus our competitors in terms of the service our associates provide, the products and the quality of the products; the quality, especially in the fresh areas, in produce and meat and seafood and our deli; and the shopping experience itself. So how long did it take me to get into the store? How long did it take me to get through the checkout line? What type of experience? Those are the things that we're focused on and that we will differentiate ourselves. We're increasingly differentiating ourselves in terms of the ability to do -- engage with us any way you want. Price, we're just making sure we don't lose customers because of price. So it's really those pieces together is where we're focused on and focused on delivering for the customer. Vincent Sinisi : Okay. And maybe just a follow-up to that, maybe more on the promotional environment, and obviously a big, kind of more theoretical question for everyone on the call is how much of this is more kind of permanent shifts in pricing versus more of just kind of the weekly blockbuster promotions, kind of like what you mentioned? So I guess, how do you think about, particularly in the second half of this year with the commodity costs showing signs of improvement, how much of kind of -- maybe some of those weekly promotions do you expect on your side to kind of moderate versus how much of this may just be more kind of permanent in nature? J. Schlotman: Yes. When you look at how people are going to promote and what weekly features are going to be, I wouldn't have enough time to step back and think about how our merchants develop their marketing plan. They're well out -- they're multiple weeks out. We certainly make assumptions about how customers or how other competitors react around holidays, how they may react in weeks during the summer when there's a lot of vacations going on and maybe fewer people at home shopping and what kind of promotions they may do. But to be able to sit here and say, this is exactly what we're expecting from a promotional standpoint, would be very difficult to say I have X, Y or Z built into the plan, other than we know there's always going to be markets and there always are markets where there are a lot of hot features going on. There's other markets that are kind of in the middle. There's high, low kind of activity kind of normal traditional grocery store pricing. And then there's other markets that are relatively benign, where you go about your daily life. Now fortunately for us, we have the number of markets we're in and the breadth of those markets, that not every market is hyper competitive at the same time. And some of the ones that aren't quite as competitive help offset that. So to sit here and try to project what the competitive environment, or more specifically, the promotional environment may be, would probably not be significantly prudent. Operator : And our next question comes from Kelly Bania from BMO Capital Markets. Kelly Bania : Just some more questions on margins and the price investments. I guess it seems fair to ask where these hot ads are? Are these traditional supermarkets? Are there any different kind of behavior that you would expect to get better over the next coming quarters from these competitors with these hot ads? And I guess, as you respond to them, how much of your response in terms of price investments is going in personalized efforts, personalized discounts versus your everyday pricing? And are you seeing any different changes in terms of what you would expect in terms of elasticity to those price investments that you are making? J. Schlotman: I'm not sure exactly where to start on all those questions. At the end of the day, we always assume this industry is going to get more competitive, quarter in, quarter out; year in, year out. And unfortunately, I guess, we're rarely disappointed with the result of our expectation, and that's that it's always a competitive market, it's always been a competitive industry. In our view, it's going to continue to be competitive. There are bursts of time where things heat up, and then there are bursts of times where it cool down. And we know over time that if somebody runs a hot feature over the course of a weekend, that's one thing. If somebody appears to be trying to put a stake in the ground on big volume important commodities to drive volume into their stores, the best thing we can do to counteract that is, as Rodney say, not lose on price on that commodity because that takes the advantage away from them and it doesn't cause any -- it doesn't get any of our loyal customers or any of our customers any reason to go anywhere else to shop. And you have to make judgments throughout the course of 1.25 years of is this a short-term thing somebody is doing that you can -- not necessarily this way, but by and large, ignore? Or is this something you need to react to? How do you balance that with planned price promotions you have? How do -- nobody on the call can see the advantage we create with our loyal households, with the My Magazines Rodney talked about where there were 6 million individualized offers in the first quarter alone that offered those households a different price than anybody sees on our shelf edge. We do that without creating any kind of price impression amongst our competitors because they don't know we're doing it. But that's the way to be able to reward and give a better price to our most loyal customers without putting it on the front page of an ad and perhaps us causing something like that happen. So we're constantly using those kind of advantages we have, primarily through 84.51\u00b0, to figure out how to reward our most loyal customers the best. W. McMullen: And the only other thing I would add, Kelly, to Mike's point, is if you look, typically, you'll have consolidation, and consolidation happens in spurts. And everything that we can see, we're probably at the front end of the next phase of consolidation. You're starting to see some competitors fall out, and it's one of the things that we think is incredibly important, to have the scale that we have and the diversity across the whole country that we have, because it allows us to continue to do what's right for our customers. We'll continue to work on improving the basic operation. And by doing those things, the shareholders continue to get a great return over time as well. Kelly Bania : Great. I guess my follow-up to that would be just in this environment, are you thinking about M&A any differently given what you just said? J. Schlotman: I wouldn't say we're thinking about M&A any differently at all. I do agree with Rodney's assessment of consolidation, and I think you'll continue to see us have the opportunity to increase our footprint in markets we're already in by the consolidation of competitors who are going by the wayside. You saw the news reports from earlier in the week in Vienna. And I think there'll be further opportunities like that going throughout the course of the next few years. It's one of the reasons why Rodney's comment on reducing our capital expenditure, on increasing our footprint. It doesn't worry me too much over the next few years because I think I can lower my CapEx, invest it in things that are going to drive sales and reduce operating costs and increase my footprint at prices below what it would cost me to build from the ground up. And when they get into those kinds of situations, it says you really want [ to fit great ] rather than buying an entire chain and trying to do something with that. So I feel really good about that part of what's going on around us. Operator : And our final question today will come from Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research. Charles Cerankosky : Rodney, could you talk a little bit about how prepared foods did just as a category, all the forms in which you sell in market prepared foods did versus a year ago? W. McMullen: It continued to grow nicely versus a year ago. It would be one of the strongest departments. And it's one of those things, as you know, we think it's -- more and more customers will go in that direction. And as you know, we went to the outside to hire some talent there, and we really feel good about the opportunity in terms of the growth opportunities, and we love the progress we're making. Charles Cerankosky : Is that an area that is going to get more capital dollars when Mike spoke earlier of infrastructure spending? W. McMullen: Yes, it'll get more capital dollars. But more importantly, it'll get more attention and just the discretionary efforts of organization, we will -- it's not as capital-intensive to make the changes we need to make there. The key thing is changing -- keeping the menus fresh and up-to-date and the attention that we spend in that area. Charles Cerankosky : And then switching to some of the offsets. Mike hinted about operating cost, projects to reduce operating expenses. That might be overshadowed this year by some of the wage investments. But could you highlight some of the projects that are going on, please? J. Schlotman: Yes. I wouldn't get too specific. One of the bigger areas that is always -- particularly of late, we have a lot of projects going on in and around shrink, some tests going on in a handful of markets trying to reduce the trends on shrink. It's early on those handful of markets, but early signs are the tests we're doing seem to be encouraging. And hopefully, as we get to the end of the year, it starts to be end of the year and into next year, something that becomes a little bit of a tailwind instead of a headwind. Charles Cerankosky : By headwind, you mean the wage investments this year are going to cover up a lot of the other expense reduction efforts? J. Schlotman: Or just shrink not being exactly where we want it and these projects being able to turn the trend on shrink. W. McMullen: Before we end today's call, I just want make a couple of comments. First of all, the changes that we talked about today and the direction we're headed in, we're making those changes proactively, and it's really based on where we see the customer is going. And we think it's incredibly important to do those changes in advance. And we're massively excited about the growth opportunities for the business going forward. We feel really good about our team in terms of the opportunities and taking advantage of those. So I wanted to make that. And then I also, as you know, I always like to share some comments with our associates who are listening in. As you've heard us describe during this call, we're focused on executing our Customer 1st Strategy and living our company's purpose, to Feed the Human Spirit. Feed the Human Spirit is our purpose because both our customers and you, our associates, told us it resonates powerfully with you. And also because it's authentic to Kroger, it's who we are. We've been living our purpose in large ways and small for more than 134 years, whether it's through providing over 1 billion meals to feed hungry families in our neighborhoods over the last 4 years, committing to be a Zero Waste company by 2020, or simply extending a smile or a helping hand to the customer, we and you make the world a better place one associate, one customer, one community at a time. Thank you for all you do every day for our customers and each other. That completes our call today. Thanks for joining. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. We do thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Kate Ward, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kate Ward : Thank you, Laura. Good morning, and thank you for joining us.  Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our second quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] Please save the date for our 2017 Investor Conference, which we will hold in New York on October 11. Details will be coming soon and we hope you can join us.  I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. W. McMullen: Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.  With me to review Kroger's second quarter 2017 results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman.  As you know, Kroger has competed in an ever-changing retail landscape for 134 years. Our success over time boils down to one thing : Our relentless focus on the customer. That focus allows us to deepen our connection with customers and create shareholder value. The customer remains the center of everything we do.  The 4 core elements of our Customer 1st Strategy are as relevant today as they were when we first introduced them. How we invest each year to drive customer engagement changes regularly based on customers' changing needs and wants. This showed in our second quarter results as we returned to positive identical supermarket sales growth and both loyal and total households increased. Traffic was up, unit movement was up and market share was up. Our customers' perception of our prices is excellent and they continue to get even better.  Based on our second quarter results and expectations for the balance of the year, we have confirmed our annual net earnings guidance. The operating environment will continue to be incredibly dynamic, but more importantly, customer behavior is changing faster than ever before.  For the last few quarters, we've talked with you about our expanded view of all the food our customers eat and how we've been working to redefine the market as share of stomach rather than share among traditional grocery stores. We know that the massive $1.5 trillion U.S. food market creates a unique and sustainable growth opportunity for Kroger. You'll see changes in the way we go to market as a leading indicator of the lens through which we view our market. We see anyone who sells food as competitors in the future.  Kroger has a history of successfully evolving to meet our customers' changing needs because we put the customer at the center of everything we do. We are transforming today, too. We are reprioritizing and accelerating investments in our Customer 1st Strategy in order to anticipate and meet rapidly evolving consumer demands to shop with us for anything, anytime, anywhere.  Our transformation is all about redefining the customer experience. As our business continues to improve, we remain committed to delivering on our guidance for 2017 and believe we have the ability to grow identical supermarket sales and market share in 2018 as well.  In this dynamic operating environment, we will continue to provide annual guidance as we've done for many years, but we'll no longer provide longer-term guidance. This will provide needed flexibility in how we invest to position us for the future success. We look forward to getting into the details of our goals and priorities at our upcoming Investor Conference in October.  But in the meantime, I'd like to begin to create a vision by sharing several ways we are redefining the customer experience to be America's inspiration and destination for everything food. We're doing this by combining our knowledge of food and our ability to personalize through the use of data analytics. We're doubling down on digital and we're leveraging new and ongoing partnerships to deepen our connection with customers and drive revenue. I'll take a few moments to share more about each of these areas where we have deep credibility from our past and are aggressively developing for our future. Food retailing is more exciting than ever before, especially as more of us become foodies. Customers have nearly an unlimited number of options when you combine tastes, flavors and types of meals with the growing number of food outcomes that consumers are focused on. Those outcomes might include eating for health or for enjoyment, for example, or lifestyle or performance reasons.  Kroger is uniquely positioned to be the partner our customers turn to for their meal needs because we know food and we know our customers better than anyone. Meals have always been our expertise. Kroger's often the one driving change and innovation behind the scenes. We are very proud of the role we played for over a decade in making natural and organic products more affordable and accessible to America, especially for shoppers on a budget. We've always believed that our customers shouldn't have to pay higher prices just because a product is natural or organic.  We developed our Simple Truth brand to be honest, easy and affordable because our data told us this was a great customer need in the marketplace. Today, Simple Truth is the biggest natural and organic brand in the country by volume. This market continues to provide a robust opportunity for Kroger.  Similarly, our culinary innovation team is bringing truly affordable and an incredibly tasty meal kits to American households through our Prep+Pared offering. Just last week, we announced that we were expanding our offering of Prep+Pared to more than 50 stores in 3 of our divisions : Cincinnati, Louisville and Ralphs.  Across Kroger, we know our customers better than anyone. We have a 13-year advantage of using data insights to connect with customers. Data analytics are fully integrated in our business as 84.51\u00b0 helps us make merchandising, operations and marketing decisions. In the last year alone, Kroger has made more than 3 billion personalized recommendations to customers through product offerings, promotions, recipes and more.  Data analytics is helping us win with our brands by identifying the best products to bring to market based on customer behavior and taste trends. Research by an independent third party shows us that our customers favor our brands over national brands and competitor offerings. The strength of our brands is what our customers realize Kroger quality is superior and at a very affordable price. It truly is quality without compromise. Kroger's customers get the best and most innovative quality at the best prices. We will build this momentum to be the premier private label destination in America.  Combining our love of food with our data expertise allows us to offer content that inspires. We recently launched a new My Recipes feature on Kroger.com that serves up a personalized selection of suggested recipes. The recipes offer greater diversity of meal ideas, all based on your individual purchase behavior. Our growing collection of recipes is also searchable by a variety of filters, including seasonality, world cuisine, meal or dish type and cooking style.  While online recipes are not new, serving them up on a personalized recipe for your family is, and customers and your family will love the new offerings, and this is distinctively Kroger. Personalized recipes are just one example of how we're bringing the combination of food and data together to create new and highly relevant customer experiences, especially through digital and e-commerce. Customers expect a great shopping experience and the ability to interact with us digitally or online in a seamless way. Our digital efforts are all about making things easier for our customers and providing personal, affordable and exclusive options that fit their needs. This includes our mobile app, for example, in addition to Vitacost.com, ClickList, ExpressLane and home delivery.  Today, we have more than 25 million digital customer accounts. As we said in our press release, our total digital sales are up 126%, driven by ClickList. We operate more than 813 ClickList and ExpressLane locations, offering the convenience of online ordering and curbside pickup. By the end of the year, we will offer this service at more than 1,000 locations. Customers continue to respond exceptionally well to ClickList.  We know that in the future, more customers will want the option of home delivery. So we are also testing various home delivery models with companies like Uber, Shyp and on our own in more than 150 stores. We will keep making these strategic investments to serve customers anything, anytime, anywhere in the near future.  With new entrants in a fragmented market, we are also transforming our business and building partnerships to deepen our relationship with and create value for our customers. We've been preparing for new market entrants for years, and the fact that Kroger is trusted by more than 60 million households annually is a great strength when customers have more food choices than ever before.  We continue to gain share in key categories like natural foods, produce and fresh prepared foods. We will continue to focus on growing our core business to generate free cash flow and deepen our personal connection with customers. These changes also create opportunities to work with our existing partners to deliver more value for customers and to identify new partnerships to create alternative revenue streams.  Now, here is Mike to share more details on our second quarter results and to walk through changes to our capital allocation process and long-term guidance. Mike? J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone.  We're pleased with our second quarter results, especially the return to positive identical supermarket sales. That, combined with strong market share, tonnage growth and both loyal and total household growth, demonstrates our ability to evolve with the changing preferences of customers. Kroger has the team, the skills, the knowledge, the scale and data analytics to be a winner in food retailing.  Another positive sign is that we had overall product cost inflation for the first time since 2015. As you know, the change from inflation to deflation and back again is one of the toughest environments to operate in for our stores, and we're proud of our team's ability to manage through it.  Our Customer 1st Strategy has always guided our strategic investments to be there for our customers today and, more importantly, to where they are going in the future. To undergo the transformation Rodney discussed, we recognize that we need to make these Customer 1st investments more aggressively and faster than ever before.  Like Rodney said earlier, we are eager to share the specific elements of our plan with you at our Investor Conference in October, but today, I will highlight 2 examples. First, 84.51\u00b0 has helped us redefine space optimization for the entire store. As this comes to life, it will drive sales and operating profit growth. In the short run, there is a cost to doing this, but we feel the return is significant. This is another example of using 84.51\u00b0 in new and innovative ways.  Second, we're making sure we have the right products at the right cost and at the right retail prices for our customers. We are approaching these efforts, along with the areas Rodney outlined earlier, with even more focus and urgency than we have in the past. For example, we've already re-prioritized the way we invest capital by both reducing the amount we spend and by turning our capital allocation process upside down. We now look first for sales driving and cost savings opportunities through both brick-and-mortar and digital platforms. Second, we will continue to make sure our logistics and technology platforms keep pace with and scale to these demands through continued investment. Then finally, we will allocate capital to storing activity. This process has allowed us to use less free cash flow for capital investments.  One thing I want to be very clear on is that we are not talking about a new strategy to replace Customer 1st. We are talking about better executing the elements of our plan to deliver on all 4 keys for our customers. As Rodney said earlier, our customer remains our focus.  We continue to see strong growth and amazing potential in our brands. During the second quarter, Our Brands sales grew more than national brands in our grocery, drug/GM and meat departments. Identical sales for Our Brands also outpaced identical supermarket sales. The second quarter brought strong sales and unit growth with Our Brands representing 27.7% of total units sold and 25.4% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy. All of this is consistent with the research we commissioned last year to give us an objective view on our brands. This included blind taste tests with national brands and other private label foods. The research showed that the most loved brand sold on our stores are our brands, above even the national brands. And in the blind taste tests, our brands outperformed competitive national brand and other private label products.  Now for an update on retail fuel. In the second quarter, our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.217 compared to $0.198 in the same quarter last year. The average retail price of fuel was $2.28 versus $2.20 in the same quarter last year.  Our net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.37 compared to 2.11 during the same period last year. This result is due to the merger with ModernHEALTH and the incremental repurchase of shares.  Over the last 4 quarters, Kroger has used free cash flow to repurchase $1.7 billion in common shares, paid $448 million in dividends, invest $3.1 billion in capital and merged with ModernHEALTH for approximately $390 million. The flexibility to return value to shareholders is a key strength of our financial strategy. We are committed to balancing the use of cash to maintain our current investment-grade rating. We have reduced our 2017 and 2018 planned capital investments by a total of $600 million to maintain this balance and flexibility. Return on invested capital for the second quarter on a rolling 4 quarters basis was 12.37%.  On the labor relations front, we recently ratified an agreement with UFCW for store associates in Atlanta and Dallas. We are currently negotiating an agreement with the UFCW for store associates in our Food 4 Less warehouse stores and with the Teamsters for the master agreement. This fall, we will begin negotiations with the UFCW for store associates in Charleston, West Virginia.  Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive cost and compensation packages that provides solid wages, good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. Kroger's financial results continue to be pressured by inefficient health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. Kroger continues to communicate with our local unions and the international unions, which represent many of our associates, the importance of growing Kroger's business and profitability, which will help us create more jobs and create more career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. Turning now to guidance for fiscal 2017. We had previously indicated that the environment during the first half of the year would be similar to the back half of 2016, and that is what we saw. Cost inflation trends for the second quarter were consistent by department with grocery, liquor, produce and meat all positive for the quarter. Deli was deflationary and pharmacy continues to be inflationary.  We are confirming our 2017 net earnings guidance for 53 weeks of $1.74 to $1.79 per diluted share. We are also confirming our adjusted net earnings guidance range of $2 to $2.05 per share. Our LIFO expectation remains unchanged at $80 million. We expect identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, of 0.5% to 1% growth for the remainder of the fiscal year. Our guidance does not include any effect from Hurricanes Harvey or Irma. Our insurance provides coverage and caps losses at $26 million for each event. Until the claim is finalized, it is difficult to provide an exact amount. And we expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to be in the $3 billion to $3.3 billion range for 2017.  Now, I will turn it back to Rodney. W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike. I'm often reminded of the saying, may you live in interesting times. These are interesting times in our industry. And I know some of you wonder how Kroger can continue to thrive in such a dynamic operating environment. We have a history of evolving to meet our customers' ever-changing needs. The key is to proactively see where the customer is going and to proactively address the changes. That is what we are doing today.  Through innovation, Kroger is redefining the food and grocery customer experience based on our core strengths. Kroger has more data than any of our competitors, which leads to deep customer knowledge and unparalleled personalization. We have incredibly convenient locations and platforms for pickup and delivery within 1 to 2 miles of our customers. We have a leadership team that competes -- combines deep experience with creative new talent. We have the scale to win with more than 60 million households shopping with us annually. In fact, we've been named America's most beloved grocery store several times. We have a proven track record of consistently returning capital to shareholders through an increasing dividend and share buyback program. And we have a track record of connecting with our associates, customers and communities to uplift and improve lives as evidenced by our team's response to Hurricane Harvey.  Now, we look forward to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Karen Short of Barclays. Karen Short : Starting, I guess, with your guidance. I guess, what I'm trying to understand is, obviously, you maintained your earnings guidance, but you now have operating margins down 30 to 40 basis points versus the prior 20 to 30. So by my math, that's about $0.09 to earnings. And so, I guess, I'm wondering, just to clarify, the offset has to be below the line, unless I'm missing something? And I just had a follow-up on the operating margin guidance change. J. Schlotman: The benefit comes from multiple places throughout the income statement, Karen. There are efforts underway that will make the operating margin decline that you saw in the second quarter not as much in the third quarter. We feel very good about the health of the business today, the trend of ID sales, our efforts on cost of goods reductions and our efforts on productivity and operating cost reductions. And when we combine all of those, we feel comfortable with the $2 to $2.05. Karen Short : Okay, but within the change in the operating margin rate. So it's now down 30 to 40 basis points versus the prior 20 to 30. Can you maybe just talk then a little bit about where -- that was a first half event then and so we would already kind of seen that? Or is there more to come in terms of gross margin or operating expenses in the second half that were not kind of -- or we hadn't been previously contemplating? J. Schlotman: Yes. I'm not going to go into every specific line of the income statement, but we are seeing good flow of cost of goods coming in and good cost savings opportunities in the back half of the year. Karen Short : Okay. And then, just one quick question. I guess, on Bloomberg, you indicated sales in the third quarter to-date were off to a nice start. I think that's what you said. Maybe can you get a little more granular, meaning are they at the high end of your second half guidance or a little more color there? W. McMullen: Yes. Currently, quarter-to-date, and this is without the hurricane effects, we would be above where we finished the second quarter and it would be closer to the high side of the guidance range. The reason we exclude the hurricane is because one day it's a positive, one day it's not because of, obviously, one day you'll have business that's up 100% or 200% and the next day it's basically 0. So we just -- until we get completely through the 2 hurricanes and when we release third quarter, we'll obviously give a lot more insight. But so far, we would be trending ahead of second quarter and closer to the top end of the range. J. Schlotman: And Houston is doing just fine. They have all but 2 stores back in operational and our warehouse is fully operational. Operator : And the next question will come from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities.  I apologize. That actually will be Zach Fadem from Wells Fargo. Zachary Fadem : I want to follow-up on the ID sales. You mentioned the recent traction, but your second half guidance would imply that you actually narrowed the annual range by 30 to 40 basis points. So could you just talk about parts here, estimates, traffic trends and maybe walk through the decision to narrow that range rather than just holding it steady or taking up the low end? J. Schlotman: Yes. Frankly, we talked about it a lot, and what our intention to do is really to take flat for the year off the table because we don't see that in the cards. We still clearly see 1% for the year in the cards and our intent was really to get the notion of flat off of the table. It may be confusing to people so far today, but that's what our intention was. We may not have done it as perfectly as we could have, but we still think the high end of the original annual guidance range is in the cards. But we don't believe flat is in the cards, which is why we wanted to take that off the table. W. McMullen: And on changing the range, as Mike mentioned, if we'd left the range the same as it was before, it could have meant that we would have had positive -- negative identicals, excuse me, for the second half of the year. And obviously, we wanted to make sure that everybody understood that we do expect identicals to be positive. And the trends that we're seeing so far, the identicals continue to improve. Zachary Fadem : Okay. That's helpful. Appreciate that. And Mike, I also wanted to follow-up on the quarterly EPS cadence that you provided last quarter. Should we still anticipate EPS up slightly in Q3 and then flat in Q4, excluding the extra week? J. Schlotman: Yes. We actually purposefully pulled the quarterly guidance cadence out of the earnings release in light of focusing more on an annual earnings per share target. I don't see any big alterations to that guidance that we had last quarter. Halfway through the year, you kind of have to wind up with those kinds of numbers to be in the $2 to $2.05 range anyway. Operator : And now, our next question will come from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : So, Rodney, 2 strategic questions. Let me start with the space optimization project you're talking about. Sort of big picture and/or little picture, is that less center store, more fresh? Is it less brands, more private label? What are you doing there? And then, what are the -- are the costs simply labor costs to rearrange shelving and the like? W. McMullen: They -- in terms of how much it encompasses, it would be everything that you mentioned plus some. And as Mike mentioned in his comments on the space optimization, 84.51\u00b0 is helping us look across the whole store and how do we use space. So obviously, in some cases, it's going to continue -- continuation of adding more fresh space. It's also -- in terms of the products that we offer to the customer, every single item has to earn its right to be on the shelf and categories have to earn the right to have a certain amount of allocation. So it's all of those things.  The expense would really be driven by 2 things. One, when you make some changes, there's some equipment that you would write off. As you make the changes, there's certainly the labor in the cost in doing the changes, plus some of the equipment gets written off almost immediately. So it's both of those factors that is behind what Mike was mentioning. J. Schlotman: And if you move things around too much inside of a store, there's obviously disruption for a short period of time to the customers being able to easily navigate as we move a lot of shelving and things around. John Heinbockel : And then, secondly, when you talk about capital allocation -- and it sounds like you want to invest in existing stores more than new stores at this point. So what does that mean for your M&A philosophy? Does that suggest less of an appetite for M&A? Does it suggest more of an appetite for digital M&A and less brick-and-mortar? W. McMullen: The -- I would say the broad comment would be, from an M&A standpoint, we would be equally as excited today as 2 years ago when we find the right person to partner with. And as you know, when we look for someone to partner, we're looking at somebody that brings things to us as much as we bring to them.  We would continue to be aggressively looking at anything digital that adds capabilities. You may recall in the past 1.5 years or so, we merged with a company called Market6 and another company called YOU Tech and we were able to use in both of those situations the 84.51\u00b0 and accelerate the work that they did and accelerate some of the work that we're doing plus brought a great amount of talent to our company. So we would increasingly look -- are there certain capabilities that somebody would bring to us and how do you partner with them in a way that would bring that capability. But for the right merger opportunity, whether it's digital or physical, we would be as excited today as 2 years ago, but it would obviously have to be somebody that fit in well with where we operate and has a business that's strong. I don't know, Mike... J. Schlotman: I agree. Operator : And our next question will come from Ken Goldman of JP Morgan. Kenneth Goldman : Two for me, if I can. Have you -- in your opinion, your competitors -- and I know it's very soon so maybe the answer is no, but have you seen anyone or have you yourself lowered any prices yet as a direct result of price changes at Whole Foods? And, I guess, can you talk a little bit about how your stores are doing the last couple weeks? It's not that Whole Foods necessarily has lowered prices that much, although arguably they have, it's just that there's been so much news about it. I'm just trying to get a sense of really what you're seeing so far in the marketplace. W. McMullen: Well, as you mentioned, Ken, it's only been 1.5 weeks. So it's very early in the process. And as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we're really proud of the work that we started over a decade ago on making sure natural and organic product is affordable to all customers. And we've never felt like just because something is natural and organic, you should charge a premium for it.  In terms of the impact, obviously it's way early, but there isn't anything that would cause you to develop any point of view at all in terms of changing trends. But it's only been 1.5 weeks so I would caveat it a million different ways. Kenneth Goldman : It feels like it's been longer in my world. The second question... W. McMullen: Obviously, the discussion around it has been longer than that. Kenneth Goldman : Yes. Yes. It wasn't a very quiet August for many of us in this industry. I'm sure not for you either. W. McMullen: No. Right. Kenneth Goldman : Can I just follow-up on one thing? In terms of your guidance for the comps in the back half of the year, I just wanted to dig in a little bit more on that because the business is doing, clearly, in some ways better, right? You're talking about comps being positive. You have positive tonnage, but the guidance does imply a fairly meaningful step down in the 2-year stack in comp in the back half. And I know there's many ways of looking at that, but that's one of the questions I've gotten from investors this morning. I just wanted to see if you had a comment on that, if you could sort of help us out understand why you're sort of thinking that comps will be a little bit maybe weaker on a 2-year level and maybe that means fundamentally weaker? Or is that not how you look at it? J. Schlotman: I don't think -- I actually don't look at 2-year stacks very much because I sold whatever I sold last year and I'm selling that plus more this year. And we feel very good about the underlying health of our business. As we said in the prepared remarks and in response to questions so far, ID sales so far in the quarter are pushing the high end of the guidance range. We grew loyal households. We grew total households. We had strong market share growth and strong tonnage growth. And I would also remind you that as our brands continue to gain strength and gain a bigger share of both units and sales, that comes at the expense of a lower retail ring, which winds up being a bit of a headwind to reported ID sales. And we are -- we have been very aggressive with how we position those products inside of our stores. Operator : And the next question will come from Ben Bienvenu of Stephens. Ben Bienvenu : On the digital revenue growth, pretty significant and obviously making progress there on the ClickList side. I'm curious, did that have any meaningful contribution to the comp that you reported in the quarter? W. McMullen: Well, it's a great question and it's hard to answer because the thing that we're trying to do for our customers is to do it in a way that's totally seamless. So the customer continues to come into the store and shop. So we actually get more of their total basket. So it's helping comps, but it's helping comps from that total customer household and how much they're spending with us. From a -- so it's helping identicals, but it's really hard to say ClickList is x percent of it or y percent of it.  I don't know, Mike, anything you want to... J. Schlotman: No. It's clear that the customers love the service and it gives them an incremental connection with Kroger. And as Rodney said, it gives us a bigger share of their wallet the longer they're engaged in ClickList. Ben Bienvenu : Understood. And then, second question on the private label business. That's been a big success factor for you. Rodney, you've highlighted in some of your initial comments the customer perception of the brands that you offer under your corporate brand. I'm curious, as you think about the future opportunity, a, what is the magnitude of that opportunity as a percentage of sales? And then, b, how much capacity do you have for self-manufacturing to deliver on that higher penetration opportunity? W. McMullen: Yes. I'll give a little bit broader answer than just your question. First of all, we would talk about it in terms of our brands versus private label because from -- and it's something that took us longer than it should have, but those brands, they are Our Brands and the customers tell us they love it. And one of the things that we probably should have done years ago, but we hadn't, but we actually was much more aggressive on hiring a third party company to do a broad taste -- taste and quality preferences for our brands across multiple national brands and other private -- other companies' private label programs. And we always thought we were good, but we came out even significantly better than what we would have even thought.  So it really highlighted the progress that our team has been making on improving the innovation in our brands, the variety of offerings. If you look at Simple Truth, obviously, 5 years ago, it didn't exist. Today, it continues to grow double digits. So when you look at overall, our customers tell us they love our brands and we continue to even get more aggressive in terms of creating additional innovation brands, offerings within it, new flavors. In terms of the potential, at this point, the only thing that I would say is it would be massive. And one of the things that we did several years ago, we went to the outside and hired a new leader for that team and about half of our team is from the outside. And when you go and look at Europe, obviously, on our brand products in Europe, the market shares there are significantly higher than the U.S. And we would be much more focused on how do we make sure the innovation, the quality and the offerings that we have, we earn the right for the customers to take it to that kind of level.  In terms of our plant capacity, if you asked our manufacturing team, they would probably tell you they're at almost capacity. I've always found and we've always found that we always figure out ways to produce incremental product and do it very efficiently. So in terms of capacity, it is one of the great things about knowing how to operate plants. We could easily expand capacity either through process change or additional -- expanding plants, things like that, whatever's needed. Operator : And next, we have a question from Robbie Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Robert Ohmes : Rodney, Walmart -- you guys called out your great digital sales growth. And one thing is can we get digital as a percent of sales from you guys? W. McMullen: Not at this point. I don't know, Mike, if you -- not at this point. As you know, we're continuing to provide a little bit more insight than before, but... Robert Ohmes : Okay. So I'll keep pushing on that, but maybe in the future some time. But I was just going to ask, Walmart, obviously, is being really aggressive with the rollout of their version of ClickList. I was hoping you can maybe speak to us about where you're having crossover with them, sort of what the dynamic looks like because, I think, you 2 are being the most aggressive at going after this new way of grocery shopping.  And then, the other question I had on competition, ALDI has been out there -- sorry, Lidl has been out there now a little bit longer than Amazon's owned Whole Foods. So maybe you could kind of update us on what you are seeing there. W. McMullen: Yes. On the crossover with Walmart on digital, I actually don't know the answer to that. Mike, do you? J. Schlotman: I don't know how many we overlap with. I do know that the thing that customers really appreciate about our offering is the fact that most of our customers live within a mile or 2 of the store. They shop and they can go pick the ClickList up offering in. So it's extremely convenient for them to engage in that kind of an activity and often use the [ in easy out ] and not all of our competitors have that advantage. W. McMullen: Yes. And it's incredibly easy to develop a shopping list with us, the work that our teams have done working with 84.51\u00b0. We do a lot of work on predicting what your shopping list will be to make it really easy to do. Like, one insight that I can give you, and I'll -- we'll have to go back and look to see what the overlap on Walmart is, our success on ClickList is very consistent across the country. You don't see one place where it's a 1% and somewhere else it's 100%. The variance of success is pretty consistent. On Lidl, obviously they continue to open stores. So far, what they've done has been pretty consistent with what we expected. And obviously, you've heard us talk about, from a pricing standpoint, we won't lose on price. We're not trying to lead the market down on price, but we're not going to lose on price.  The success so far in terms of being able to maintain our business and grow our business, we feel very good about our -- the ability to compete against ALDI, Lidl and anybody else. So I wouldn't say there's been any surprises so far. Obviously, they're a great competitor, but there's a lot of great competitors out there. Robert Ohmes : And just last question. The lack of -- the move away from giving us long-term guidance. Is the ramp-up of ClickList a big piece of that, meaning does it really pressure store profitability in the short-term because you haven't -- is that how we should think about it? Is ClickList just great, but in the short-term, it's a real pressure on margins? W. McMullen: Well, as everybody on the call knows, we make our investment decisions in terms of what do we think is best for our business 3 to 5 years out and -- which, in turn, means what's best for our shareholders 3 to 5 years out. There is no doubt that ClickList is a headwind on earnings currently. And we've even continued to accelerate the speed in which we put ClickList in. So it's an incremental headwind. We feel very comfortable when you look at it over a 3- to 5-year period of time. Our customers will appreciate that we offer ClickList. Our associates obviously, in terms of being able to provide the service, will be glad and our shareholders will be glad. So we can clearly see where we're -- there's a path where we're indifferent on whether somebody comes into the store or shops with us on ClickList. It's -- you do have initial pain. And that would be a peek of caused us to affect the long-term guidance perspective. Operator : And our next question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS. Mark Carden : This is Mark Carden on for Michael Lasser today. So you commented earlier that periods transitioning from deflation to inflation can lead to a challenging operating environment. And so given we saw food at home CPI turn inflationary again this quarter, can you comment on how the competitive environment has held up relative to your expectations? And by that, has it been different from past cycles or pretty much in line with what you've seen recently? J. Schlotman: Yes. I would say it's fairly common or a fairly traditional kind of a transition. It's just that any time you go from higher prices to lower prices, the thing that gets disrupted is how quickly will people lower prices. And then, the flip is the case as inflation creeps back in, how quickly will people adjust their prices the other direction to continue to protect their gross margin dollars that they would have in those products. And that's what causes the disruption in the short run as you're cycling through the 2 of those. I would say broad-based there isn't anything that's really out of the realm of what you normally see. The one exception to that would be what we talked about earlier in the year relative to some low milk prices earlier in the year and eggs continue to be pretty inexpensive as well, but those would probably be the only 2 categories that I would hold out as maybe exceptions to the norm right now. Mark Carden : Okay. Great. And then, I guess, a little bit more near-term, you mentioned that, with hurricanes, there's obviously some variability. One day you could see a benefit from stock-up trips while the next day you see a decline from closed stores. I guess, historically, have you seen this trend towards either a net benefit or a net loss? Or is it really just varied based on the storm? J. Schlotman: It really varies based on the storm. I would say, at the end of the day, there is probably -- it depends -- one, it depends how the insurance claim winds up getting reconciled. But from your business inside the store, there is usually a slight benefit. One of the things we've always done a great job at is being one of the first people fully back in business and being able to service our customers and the communities where we have our stores. And it's very important for those folks when if they've been evacuated and the local authorities lift the evacuation order, we have to be back in business for them or they're going to have a really big problem when they let folks come back into their homes. Many of those folks have lost product in their homes and they have to stock back up once they can get back in their homes. So there are just so many factors in it, but first and foremost, we try to be in it for our associates, our customers and our communities because they do need food to eat and we've always been there to provide it for them. W. McMullen: The other thing that's -- we have such great relationships with local agencies. Almost always, we would be considered part of the first responder group because people understand that it's important for the grocery stores to get stocked. So our associates would be given clearance as a first responder in most cases. J. Schlotman: Clearance to get to the store, often part of the first grids to come back on in power. There's a whole litany of things that -- before you come back from an evacuation, you have to get basic services up, you have to have food. And we typically always fall inside that and are there ready to help. Operator : The next question comes from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : So I also just wanted to touch on maybe some of the larger CPG players out there. We continue to see weakening trends from a number of the larger players. And I was just curious, as you look at your partnerships with them, are you at all starting to see more efforts by them in terms of maybe supporting their products in store or even maybe improving competitiveness? W. McMullen: Well, on CPGs, as you know, we always work with CPG partners trying to understand how we grow our business on a combined basis. So both of us are very focused on growing the business. I think CPGs continue to aggressively incrementally try to work on -- work with us on helping grow their business. It's one of the things that's nice about having the great insight we have with 84.51\u00b0. We partner with most CPGs in a different and more deep way that also involves product innovation. So there is no doubt there's a tremendous amount of change going on. The CPGs feel that change. And we're working with the CPGs for both of us to grow our business. But obviously, we're also working on focusing on growing our business as well. Rupesh Parikh : Okay. Great. And going back to maybe a question that was asked earlier on the promotional environment. Because it sounds like some of the items that were more promotional, eggs and milk, you continue to see pockets of increased promotions out there. But outside of that, how would you characterize the promotional environment versus what you were seeing earlier this year? W. McMullen: Outside of that, I really wouldn't say that it's -- there's been a massive trend change. What did they used to always say in economics, all short statements are wrong. So you give the scenario and I can find it somewhere. The biggest change would be -- continue to be milk and eggs across the country. Everywhere else would be puts and takes. Operator : And our next question will come from Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley. Vincent Sinisi : I just want to go back a little bit more to the overall pricing strategy, right? Obviously, kind of since last quarter, it's been a big topic for you guys. What is the 84.51\u00b0 data telling you? Like, when you're making decisions in different geographies to either be a leader or a match or a close follower on pricing on some of these high-velocity items, is it kind of always the case that you kind of have to match it to keep that loyal customer? Or if they go somewhere else, how long does it take to get them back? And maybe just a little bit around the consumer behavior that the data is telling you. W. McMullen: The biggest thing that the 84.51\u00b0 insight shows us is the customer decides where to shop based on the total experience. And obviously, that total experience is what's the shopping environment like. So what's -- how the associates treat the customer, what kind of rewards do you have, what type of personalized offers are you making, which it's very hard for anybody to see that other than each one of us as a customer individually, and then obviously, from a fresh product standpoint, having great produce, meat, deli, dinner tonight, those kind of things. So the thing that's really important is the -- all of that together. The price -- the specific price items -- really each one of us would have different items that are our biggest hot button. So it would be factoring in all of those things in terms of how we decide where to price and how to price. And the insights -- the biggest part of the insights is it really is important to customers for the over total experience, not just one dimensional of the experience. Vincent Sinisi : Okay. And then, maybe just a quick follow-up. Just going back to the maintained EPS guidance for the year. It would seem that, at least with 10 basis points lower margin, at least one of the larger offsetting factors would be from fuel. So maybe just any thoughts on the profitability on the fuel side for the back half of the year. And also, just I don't know, I might have missed it, but can you give us an inflation number as well for this quarter? J. Schlotman: What was the last part? You kind of tailed... Vincent Sinisi : Yes, the inflation for the quarter. J. Schlotman: So for fuel, it continues to be a strong year in fuel. And I don't want to play the hurricane card again, but obviously, refineries have been shut down. The Colonial Pipeline was shut down for a while. Supply has been tight in some places. So there will probably be some disruptions overall in the third quarter. We haul fuel from a lot of distant places to get -- to keep a lot of our stores in fuel. So I still think fuel had a relatively good back half of the year.  Relative to inflation, I ticked off the categories that saw some inflation and deflation. We did have inflation for the first time ever. In the grocery category, it was -- probably it was 48 or 49 basis points of inflation, which is the biggest driver of where the overall business winds up going. And that's the first time in -- well, my sheet goes all the way back to third quarter of '14 in the grocery category, on a quarterly basis, that's the first time since the fourth quarter of '14 that we had any inflation in the grocery category. Operator : The next question comes from Stephen Tanal of Goldman Sachs. Stephen Tanal : Just to better understand the reduction in the nonfuel operating margin guidance, is that more about gross margin or operating expenses versus sort of the initial thought process? J. Schlotman: Yes. What was your comment on the guidance of reducing the nonfuel operating margin? Stephen Tanal : Yes. Is the reduction more about gross margin being a little worse than initially thought or operating expenses being a bit higher? J. Schlotman: I don't know that we gave -- I'm unfamiliar with us having given guidance on operating margin for the back half of the year. W. McMullen: It's in the 8-K. J. Schlotman: It's in the 8-K? Okay. I got you. I was going to say we didn't talk about it in the -- on the call.  It's the continuation of what we've seen. We do think from a dollar standpoint that we're going to continue -- that we'll start to see some strengthening of gross profit dollars and operating profit margin dollars as we go throughout the year. As ID sales continue to get stronger, that will help grow the dollars, which is obviously the most important thing to grow earnings per share by. And at the end of the day, we focus on the dollars, not the rate. Stephen Tanal : Okay. Fair enough. And just to follow-up on the milk and eggs comment, I think you might have mentioned just now sort of across the country, and I don't know that, that was consistent with sort of the last time I heard about that. Has it broadened out? Did I catch that right? And pursuant to that, were the price investments that you guys announced last quarter, do you feel like still they're already sufficient? W. McMullen: Yes. The milk and eggs, I didn't -- the comment I made, I didn't intend to infer that it changed anything from the first quarter in terms of broadening out or narrowing or anything on milk and eggs.  Now, what was the second part of your question? Stephen Tanal : Second part is just around the price investments in those categories. Do you still feel pretty good about that? Or what you've done already, is that sufficient at this stage based on the geographies where you're seeing that pressure? W. McMullen: Well, I would just, I guess, I would broaden it we feel good about the pricing investments that we make. And based on what the customer's telling us, it continues to connect as we expected and we feel good about it when you look at everything in total. Stephen Tanal : Got it. And this is the last one, just on the inflation comment. Was that specific to groceries or to center store? Or was that kind of all-in applicable to IDs? And if not, could you give us sort of an all-in number? J. Schlotman: Well, the all-in number was ID sales, without inflation, without the pharmacy business, was about 60 basis points of inflation, so not a whole lot different than the grocery category. Operator : And the next question comes from Shane Higgins of Deutsche Bank. Shane Higgins : So nonfuel FIFO gross margins, excluding ModernHEALTH, were down about 30 basis points. That was a pretty good improvement versus the first quarter. Could you guys just walk us through some of the puts and takes of that decline? And is that more reflective of some moderation in the price investments? Is it private label mix? Just any color there would be great. J. Schlotman: I would say there would be 2 things that helped that. And one is the continued strength and growth of our brands, which, while it dampens the top line a little bit, comes at a better gross margin rate. And the second is we continue to do a great job on cost of goods and the input cost of that. And one of the things the CPGs partners like about the cost of goods investments is we do pass those on to the customers, but it does help strengthen the gross profit rate in dollars over time when you have the better cost of goods that are out there. W. McMullen: Also, in some of the cost -- operating cost categories, the second quarter trends improved versus the first quarter as well. Shane Higgins : And should we expect that to continue into the third quarter, that trend? J. Schlotman: I would think so. Shane Higgins : Okay. Great. And just a quick follow-up. I just had a bigger picture question on just -- obviously, the retail environment has been pretty challenging over the past year or 2. Do you guys anticipate any kind of acceleration in store closures from weaker competitors over the next year or 2 years? Not sure how much visibility you guys have into that, but if so, would you guys be prepared to maybe purchase any of these assets or locations, similar to what you did with Marsh? And how does your decision to pare back CapEx kind of play into that dynamic, if at all? W. McMullen: We feel very strongly that we would expect additional consolidation going forward. And the consolidation will happen the way you described plus other ways in terms of companies merging and other things. So we don't think there is any doubt that you'll continue to see a lot of consolidation.  You've always heard us talk about on -- anything that happens, you should assume that we've looked at it. And if you look at what we did with Marsh, obviously those worked out really well for us because it's specific trade areas that we haven't been able to get into. And by buying some stores from somebody in that situation, you're able to get into trade areas and leverage all your existing infrastructure.  Those we always like, but they're lumpy. So you won't have any for a couple of years, and then you'll have a whole bunch of them happen, but those are ones that we will always be interested in and always take a look at. But you should assume that our overall view on merging with somebody is the same and we continue to look at stuff. Operator : That final question will come from Alvin Concepcion of Citi. Alvin Concepcion : Great. Just curious about your natural and organic portfolio, the growth rate you're seeing there, what portion of your business it now represents. And related to that, what is your private label penetration in natural and organic? W. McMullen: If you look at natural and organics overall, it's over a $16 billion business for us on an annual basis. So obviously it's an important part of our business. It continues to grow strongly and we would continue to see a great opportunity in that space. We find more and more customers, for some items, they will purchase a natural or organic item. In other places, they will buy traditional items. And for us, what we try to do is we don't judge a customer on how they eat and we try to make sure we have what the customer wants at a great value.  In terms of the share of market, if you -- it depends on how you define share of market. If you look at Simple Truth last year, it was, what, a $1.7 billion category for us. And they -- if you look at the $16 billion in total, that would obviously include some non-branded items and other items, so that would give you some insight in terms of share of market. If you look at grocery overall, grocery, typically on units, is close to 30%. So obviously there's still a lot of room to grow. Alvin Concepcion : Great. And my follow-up is just on click-and-collect. Just curious what kind of penetration you've seen in stores that have had it longer? Where do you think that can go? And also how do the visits and basket compare to an in-store customer? W. McMullen: Yes. When you look at total, we get more of the customers' business and that's what we find -- the reason why we are so supportive and keep working on it.  In terms of the share of business, at this point, we wouldn't give the specifics on stores and what percentage of their business is in ClickList. It's a reasonably wide range. And the range isn't driven by anything that is -- it's more specific stores. So I know one store that has a pretty high percentage. It's right off the interstate so that store has gained a lot of new customers because it's easy on and easy off the interstate and their trade area for ClickList is completely different than their trade area for the store.  For us, what we've tried to design is a business model that we know -- a certain percentage of business, it's more efficient to do it in store because of not having incremental asset investment. At the point in time that it grows, it's easily convert it to dark stores or a freestanding warehouse facility where you put in more automation. So what we've tried to do is design where we can support and partner and make money, and the customers will take it to whatever percentage of our business they take it, and we'll be there for them as they go. So we've really worked hard on having a model that's easily scalable and scalable in terms of what percent of penetration it becomes.  Thanks to everyone on the call. Obviously, hopefully, you hear some of the comments that Mike and I are making. Kroger is playing to win. And the things that we do are what we believe will be best when you look out 3 to 5 years for our customers and associates. And what we've always found when we do both of those, that our shareholders are well-rewarded as well. And the business continues to generate great free cash flow and we have great opportunities in front of us.  So -- and then, one other comment. As you know, I always like to share some additional thoughts with our associates that are listening in. First of all, I'd like to send our well wishes to the people of Houston and especially members of our Kroger family whose lives have been turned upside down by the recent hurricane and its aftermath. Our thoughts and prayers are with those who are now bracing for Hurricane Irma as well.  Since the rains stopped in Houston, you have shown nothing can stop the strength, resilience and power of our amazing associates. Many of you stayed in or couldn't easily leave stores, distribution centers, plants and offices and stayed overnight and worked tirelessly to not only serve our customers, but to provide food and supplies to first responders and local shelters. As a company, we've sent nearly 2,800 semis packed with food, water and other critical supplies to the region. More than 350 individual associates from all corners of the country traveled to Houston to lend their hands to help uplift the community. Having a physical presence and truly being part of a community is always important. This is perhaps never more apparent than when you have natural disasters strike. You and our stores are a vital part of the communities we serve.  What I'm most proud of is how you've taken care of each other, whether that's giving a hug to someone who needs it or traveling across the country to work side by side in reopening our stores and warehouse. We take care of each other. It's who we are. Each day, we open our doors and welcome our neighbors with true hospitality and generosity. And together, we make the world a better place. Thank you for all you do, in big ways and small ways, to Feed the Human Spirit. We are truly Kroger strong. That completes our call today. Thanks for joining. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please also note today's event is being recorded.  At this time, I'd like to turn the conference call over to Ms. Kate Ward, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead. Kate Ward : Thanks, Jamie. Good morning, and thank you for joining us.  Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our third quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. While there, we encourage you to visit the Events and Presentations page to find the full slide set outlining Restock Kroger as laid out at our Annual Investor Conference on October 11. Restock Kroger will be the framework we will be using over the next few years to clearly communicate how we plan to serve America through food inspiration and uplift and, as a result, create shareholder value.  After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. W. McMullen: Thank you, Kate, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.  With me to review Kroger's third quarter 2017 results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman.  I'd like to thank you for joining us at our 2017 Investor Conference in New York last month where we outlined Restock Kroger, our plan to create shareholder value by redefining how America eats. Food retailing is more exciting than ever. More Americans identify as foodies and customers have more food choices than ever before.  In the past, we have defined our market as share among traditional grocery stores. Today, we've redefined our market as share of stomach. This sharpens our focus when we look at our industry and our customers. We see anyone who sells food as competitors, which doubles the size of our market to $1.5 trillion. If you're eating, we want to serve you that meal. The fact that Kroger is trusted by more than 60 million households is an incredible competitive advantage.  Kroger has competed in an ever-changing retail landscape for 134 years because our touchstone has always been the customer. We place the customer at the center of everything we do. And because of our relentless focus on serving customers, Kroger is uniquely positioned to be the partner they turn to for meals. Restock Kroger has 4 main drivers : Redefine the grocery customer experience, expand partnerships to create customer value, develop talent and live our purpose. These pillars combined will create shareholder value. Going forward, I plan to highlight an item or 2 each quarter that we've made headway on.  This quarter, I'd like to begin by talking about how we are creating a seamless environment where our customers can choose how they engage with us, in store and online. Our efforts are all about making things easier for our customers and providing personalized, affordable and exclusive options that fit their needs. Seamless will play a major role in redefining the grocery customer experience. Our hypothesis has always been that our customers will want to have options on how they engage with us. This hypothesis shaped our strategy and we've been executing that strategy by accelerating Kroger's digital and e-commerce efforts for the last several years.  We know that our customers have already decided they love ClickList, which is why we continue to rapidly expand that offering. By year's end, we will be serving customers at more than 1,000 click-and-collect locations. Our third quarter digital revenue growth was 109% driven by ClickList.  We also know that some customers desire home delivery. We've gone from 0 to more than 300 locations offering home delivery in a span of a little over a year by partnering with service providers, including SCRIP, Roadie, Uber and others. We'll continue to build on our home delivery offering in 2018 with these partners as well as Instacart, who we are developing a unique relationship with. We have initially launched a partnership with them in Southern California. We'll continue to use our data and customer insights to make it really easy for our customers to navigate across the channels they choose when shopping with us and we'll continue leveraging our physical proximity to our customers as a competitive differentiator.  To do all of this requires the investment we outlined in Restock Kroger. Everything that we're seeing in our data and in customer behavior tells us Kroger's transition to seamless is working. Today, households that engage in our seamless offerings, engaging digitally and with our physical stores, spend more per week than households that do not.  The future looks even more promising. We'll continue to add even more services, expand our available product selection and more effectively use our insights to create a personalized experience that every customer will love. Winning in a seamless world also means optimizing space and ensuring our brick-and-mortar experience is curated to deliver exactly what customers are looking for.  We firmly believe that customers of the future will continue to frequent physical stores with compelling offers and experiences. A very recent example of this is Kroger had our best-ever Black Friday results for general merchandise led by record sales at our Fred Meyer division.  Another focus area on redefining the grocery customer experience is winning with Our Brands. It's no surprise that America's most beloved grocery store has some of America's most beloved brands, which, as a portfolio, we will continue to champion for growth. In fact, Our Brands as a stand-alone company would be in the top 1/3 of the Fortune 500.  In the third quarter, Our Brands continued to deliver strong performance, making up 28.2% of unit sales and 25.6% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy. Simple Truth continues to resonate in a big way with our customers with sales growing 19% in the third quarter.  Another important Restock Kroger area is focused on accelerating cost of goods savings and sales leverage. We will continue to work on controlling costs to invest in areas that matter most to customers. For example, we are leveraging our relationship with suppliers to drive costs and inefficiencies out of our various businesses. These processes have successfully driven significant savings in cost of goods, which allow us to invest in price for our customers. At the same time, this helps our suppliers generate volume growth. Our use of data and science creates opportunities and efficiencies that both parties benefit from. Across the board, customers are recognizing our efforts to redefine the customer experience and they are rewarding us with their loyalty. This, in turn, creates value for our shareholders. That's exactly what Restock Kroger is designed to do. We will create shareholder value by generating incremental margin dollars and free cash flow over the next 3 years. As our business continues to improve, we remain committed to delivering on our 2017 earnings guidance. We are also confident we have the ability to grow identical supermarket sales and market share in 2018.  Now, here is Mike to share more details on our third quarter results and discuss our fourth quarter and fiscal 2017 and '18 guidance. Mike? J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone.  Our core business was strong in the third quarter. We are very pleased with our ID sales exceeding 1% in the third quarter. We're especially happy to see the very strong performance in our fresh departments. The results in produce and meat were terrific and we continue to see double-digit growth in natural foods. Our ID sales results were driven by both higher spend per unit and strong growth in the number of households. Total visits continue to grow throughout the quarter and our market share was up. Our business is gaining momentum and our customers are recognizing the investments we are making.  We noted at our investor conference that over the next 3 years, Restock Kroger will be fueled by $9 billion in capital investments, cost savings and free cash flow. We recognize that in order for -- in order to be there for our customers today and, more importantly, to be where they are going into the future, we need to make investments more aggressively and faster than ever before.  We've already prioritized the way we invest capital by both reducing the amount we spend and optimizing our capital allocation process. We now look first for sales-driving and cost savings opportunities through both brick-and-mortar and digital platforms. Second, we will continue to make sure our logistics and technology platforms keep pace with and scale to those demands that were created through these investments. Then finally, we will allocate capital to storing activity. This process has allowed us to use less free cash flow for capital investments.  As Rodney said earlier, we are aggressively managing OG&A costs and implementing new programs to reduce our cost of goods sold. One example is our recent decision to require on-time and in-full delivery from suppliers. We're implementing penalties when scheduled deliveries are missed within a designated window. Over time, this will help keep costs down by ensuring more predictable operations, but more importantly, it will ensure that we have the products in our shelves that our customers want and when they want them.  We expect Restock Kroger to generate $400 million in incremental operating profit margin over the 3 years from 2018 to 2020. We also expect to generate more than $4 billion of free cash flow after dividends over the next 3 years. Our goal is to continue generating shareholder value even as we make strategic investments to grow our business. Fuel performance was also outstanding in the quarter. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.249 compared to $0.179 in the same quarter last year. The average retail price of fuel was $2.46 versus $2.17 in the same quarter last year. This, along with our store -- our strong core business results, demonstrates the diversity of our earnings.  The fuel performance in the quarter also created the opportunity for us to make an incremental $111 million contribution into our UFC Consolidated Pension Plan. Funding these obligations proactively over time demonstrates our ability to meet our commitment to protect employee pensions while simultaneously delivering value for shareholders.  As you know, we announced last month our intention to explore strategic alternatives for our Convenience Store business, including a potential sale. This was a result of a review of assets that are potentially of more value outside the company than as part of Kroger. This process is ongoing and there has been a high level of interest.  As we stressed last month, our Convenience Store management and associates are an important part of our success. We value what they do and thank them for continuing to put our Customer 1st everyday as we conduct this evaluation.  Over the last 4 quarters, we used cash to contribute an incremental $1.1 billion to company-sponsored pension plans, repurchased 59 million common shares for $1.7 billion, paid $446 million in dividends and invest $2.9 billion in capital. Our financial strategy is to use our financial flexibility to drive growth while also returning capital to shareholders and maintaining our current investment-grade debt rating. We continually balance the use of cash flow to achieve these goals.  As of the end of the third quarter, our current share repurchase authorization had approximately $590 million remaining and return on invested capital for the third quarter on a rolling 4 quarters basis was 12.31%. Now, I'm going to spend a lot more time talking about pensions this quarter than I normally would. This is driven by not only what we've done this quarter, but also what we've been doing over the past several years.  About a decade ago, we identified a great amount of exposure on pension plans and recognized then that we would need to begin addressing that exposure like we would any big endeavor, one step at a time. Our efforts began in earnest in 2011 when we negotiated and created the UFCW Consolidated Pension Plan. The keys for us were capping prior service costs, negotiating a new benefit accrual going forward, consolidating 4 plans into one and sharing both professional and more efficient management of the assets going forward. We agreed to plan -- to fund the plan over 5 years, but elected to fund it in January of 2012. This arrangement reduced Kroger's annual multiemployer pension expense and skewed -- secured the pension benefits for tens of thousands of Kroger associates.  Including this agreement, we have since made more than $2.3 billion in payments and funding commitments with 2 objectives in mind : One, to address the underfunding in the company-sponsored pension plans; and 2, to address the liabilities of various troubled multiemployer pension plans. We have adopted this approach in a low-interest rate environment to provide greater stability for the pension benefits earned by thousands of Kroger associates and retirees and to manage this liability proactively or, frankly, to avoid kicking the can down the road.  We have said for some time that we expect our net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio to grow. This is because we are bringing an off-balance sheet item onto our balance sheet or funding an obligation already on our balance sheet. As a result, we are updating our target range for this ratio to 2.2x to 2.4x. These obligations, whether recorded on or off Kroger's balance sheet, have generally been considered when our credit profile's been reviewed, but since they weren't funded, did not get picked up in our net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio. Our current result of 2.57x is above this range. We expect to use free cash flow and potential proceeds from the sale of assets to get us back in the range. Protecting associate and retiree pensions is one significant way that we take care of our associates. Another is hiring and job creation. Kroger is currently hiring to fill 14,000 part-time and seasonal jobs. This is in addition to the nearly 10,000 permanent jobs we've already created in 2017. Through Restock Kroger, we plan to invest an incremental $500 million in human capital in wages, training and development over the next 3 years. This will be in addition to our continued efforts to rebalance pay and benefits while also focusing on certifications and performance incentives, career opportunities and training.  On the labor relations front, we recently ratified an agreement with the UFCW for store associates in Charleston, West Virginia and we are currently negotiating an agreement with the Teamsters for the master agreement. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive cost and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates.  Our financial results continue to be pressured by inefficient health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions which represent many of our associates. The importance of growing our business and growing it profitably, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.  Turning now for our guidance for the fourth quarter of '17 and all of '17. We expect fuel margins to moderate in the fourth quarter and we're already seeing that quarter-to-date. We expect fourth quarter identical supermarket sales growth exceeding -- excluding fuel, to exceed 1.1%.  We confirmed our 2017 net earnings guidance for 53 weeks of $1.74 to $1.79 per diluted share and our adjusted net earnings guidance range of $2 to $2.05 a share. Both our GAAP and adjusted net earnings per diluted share guidance includes the effect of the hurricanes. The low end of this range is $0.04 above where industry analyst consensus forecast had been, demonstrating Kroger's ability to deliver shareholder value in a dynamic transition year.  Our LIFO expectation has been lowered to $60 million from $80 million and we expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to be approximately $3 billion for 2017.  Before I turn it back to Rodney, I want to note that in the 8-K we filed earlier today, we reconfirmed our early thoughts on 2018. Rodney? W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike.  We are pleased with the third quarter results and the fourth quarter is off to a solid start. Our associates are providing friendly and fresh service to our customers in a seamless way.  In addition to Restock Kroger, we outlined our investment thesis at the Investor Day last month and I'd like to share it with you again today because we feel like it really highlights our strengths. As America's growth -- grocer, we are growing in a fragmented market. Kroger has more data than any of our competitors, leading to deep customer knowledge and unparalleled personalization. We have incredibly convenient locations and platforms for pickup and delivery within 1 to 2 miles of our customers. We have a leadership team that combines deep experience with creative new talent. We have the scale to win with more than 60 million households shopping with us annually. In fact, Kroger has been named America's most loved grocery store several times. We connect personally with our associates, customers and communities to uplift and improve lives. We have a proven track record of consistently returning capital to shareholders through an increasing dividend and share buyback program. And with Restock Kroger in place, we are confident in our ability to continue winning with customers, growing our business and creating shareholder value.  Now, we look forward to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Karen Short from Barclays. Karen Short : I'm just trying to understand gross margins a little bit better. So Mike, you just said in the prepared remarks that you expect margins to moderate in the fourth quarter. And obviously, everyone was very surprised by the 30 basis point up gross margins this quarter. So, I guess, I'm wondering if you could just shed a little more light on what might have been transitory this quarter? J. Schlotman: What I talked about as far as moderation in margins in the fourth quarter was we expect our fuel margins to moderate in the fourth quarter and we've already been seeing that. What happened with gross margins this quarter, the 30 basis points without the fuel, ModernHEALTH and LIFO charge that we talked about in the earnings release, we have become significantly more diligent on lowering our cost of goods and negotiations with our vendors. Our sales mix was very strong in the quarter relative to more natural foods and more Our Brands, which helps drive our margin rate up, and those did offset continued price investments. Our costs -- our inflation at costs is still above our inflation at retail if you go back to the chart I used at the investor conference, but they are beginning to converge and both of them are now on positive territory. I don't want anybody to think we didn't invest in price in the quarter because we certainly did in a very big way and it's really the factors I talked about. Karen Short : So is it fair to say then this dynamic in terms of the -- being better at lowering cost of goods is something we should expect at least for the next 3 quarters? And then, in any way, you could just give what cost inflation was versus retail inflation? J. Schlotman: Yes. I won't get into the habit of revisiting that chart. They were both over 0. So we did have cost inflation as well as retail price inflation that got passed on, but we didn't pass all of it on. I also won't get into the habit of predicting where gross margins may go on a quarter-to-quarter basis because you never know exactly what negotiations or what benefits may fall in a particular quarter, but we do feel good about the results we posted. Karen Short : Okay. Just one follow on. On the expenses because you did talk about multiemployer quite a bit, can -- any color on how to think about multiemployer expenses next year versus this year just directionally? J. Schlotman: As I sit here today, what I -- so there's 2 components of multiemployer expenses. There is one that we make on a cents per hour basis as part of our contracts to third party plans that we don't manage. We may be a trustee on those. So those will be whatever the hours we work in the contractual rate per hour. My guess is that you would see a slight increase, some increase in that number.  I think as you think about contributions to our multiemployer -- to the UFCW plan that I talked about we created 5 years ago, as I sit here today, I would expect that to be slightly less next year than this year given the contribution we just made plus they are having a very nice year from a return on asset basis. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Lasser. Michael Lasser : So if the rate of gross margin that you saw in this quarter continues, would you use that as an opportunity to accelerate and deepen your price investments? And what are you seeing on the competitive environment as far as pricing at this point? W. McMullen: Well, one of the things that you've heard us say for a long time is we will not lose on price and we'll continue to use our data and insights to understand where we should be priced on a basket of goods and individual items. So we will continue using that data to influence and cause us to invest in pricing going forward.  As you know, at our Investor Day, Mike outlined that, looking over the next 3 years, we would view over the next 3 years we'll aggressively continue to invest in price and we'll use the savings from all the things that Mike outlined to pay for those continued investments for our customers.  I don't know, Mike, if you want to add anything. J. Schlotman: No. I mean, you hit the nail on the head. We have been and will continue to invest in price and we have a lot of plans in place to figure out ways to pay for that. Michael Lasser : Yes. And my follow-up question is if we did get a tax reform and your tax rate goes down significantly, how would you look to deploy that benefit to your P&L? Would you just let it flow to shareholders or would you look to subsidize investments you might make with that savings? W. McMullen: The one thing that -- first of all, we're very excited about where the tax reform is headed. We're especially excited about the House version because it starts almost immediately where the Senate is delayed a year. We believe it will also influence for us to continue to invest in our business, which will grow jobs. And I think what will end up happening is you'll see us do a balance of everything together, some of it our shareholders will benefit from, some of it our associates will benefit from and our customers will benefit from it as well because we really view that all of it together is what drives a sustainable business that continues improving over time. And as you know, that's been our strategy for a long period of time and we'd really look at this as an opportunity to continue to drive growing our business, creating jobs, being able to share some of that with our associates and customers as well. Operator : Our next question comes from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : So let me start, Rodney, Mike. I know it's harder to manage this balance than we think, right, between comps and margin improvement. How would you characterize the balance right now? Are you happy with the balance between the 2? And then, I know you said you won't lose on price. Do certain competitors out there, has that message gotten through such that some selective irrationality has dissipated? Or is that still going on? W. McMullen: The -- for us, I felt really good about the balance for the quarter, but I would broaden it a little broader than your example because I would also include cost controls. We're making some improvement on shrink and some other piece -- elements as well. So when I look at the overall balance, I felt good about what we were able to accomplish. At the same time, focusing on investing in some entry-level rates for our associates in several markets as well. The other thing that I liked about the balance for the quarter is it sets us up well going into the fourth quarter as well.  On pricing, I remember years ago Joe Pichler told me, on economists, all short statements are wrong. And on the -- if you tell me what you want me to find, I think I can probably find it on pricing across the market. So we would not view that the market is any different today than it was 2 months ago, 5 months ago or whatever. It's really any more -- it's almost store-specific. It's not even market-specific in many cases. I was in a competitor the other day and 3 miles apart, the milk price and egg prices were over $1 per unit different. Sorry. John Heinbockel : And then, I was going to say, secondly, on ClickList, right, you haven't said how many you're going to open next year. What's your thinking in terms of how fast you want to go? Obviously, that's not -- with incremental customers, it's not that dilutive. Does that incline you to go faster if the organization can handle it? And then, is there anything differently you're going to do operationally next year with ClickList? Or I know at some point you may think about where the demand is, right, and how you handle that longer term, but do you do anything different operationally in terms of how you pick -- how you consolidate orders or pretty much it is what it is for '18? W. McMullen: Well, for '18, we haven't given a specific number. And I can tell you, internally we're actually still working on it as you look at the second half of the year. Obviously, in the first quarter and second quarter, we have those lined up.  The -- we would continue to get ClickList in every store that we can do and that makes sense. We use our insights to understand in some places it just wouldn't make sense. There are some stores where we would like to have it, but we just don't have the physical space. So your -- one of the things you're trying to do is find the physical space.  Operationally, today, we continue to see progress in our operational metrics as it matures and as we use technology to make it easier for our store teams. At the current volume, I don't see huge changes in approach, but that's one of the things that we're so excited about. Our online approach is at a certain point it's -- by far, the most effective way of doing it is in store, but if the volume becomes high enough, it's very easy to transition that over to dark stores and just tie it into our existing infrastructure. So we feel really good about where we are and we feel good about, as the volume changes, we can adjust the model to continue to connect.  I don't know, Mike, did you want to... J. Schlotman: No. I agree with you and know -- and we obviously announced our relationship with Instacart that we have in Southern California, which will be a prime example of what Rodney said. We're, on average, smaller stores and smaller parking lots. And this is a great solution for a market like that where it's a service that customers want, but the physical assets we have wouldn't support it. Operator : Our next question comes from Shane Higgins from Deutsche Bank. Shane Higgins : Yes. I just wanted to follow-up a little bit on the ClickList. I mean, you guys had over 500 stores, I believe, this time last year. Any color you can give us just in terms of how those stores have kind of ramped and performed over the last few quarters and just in terms of any contribution to the comp and how that's impacted margins? W. McMullen: Yes. It helps comps. From an expense standpoint, it's continuing to invest in the future. And as everybody's heard me talk about it before, everything that we have learned and seen on ClickList, it takes 3 to 5 years before we're really indifferent on a financial perspective of whether somebody comes into the store and shops or somebody shops ClickList. And obviously that's the labor that the customer provides on picking their groceries versus us picking it for them, but over time, we continue to grow the business and we get better operationally from an expense standpoint.  So if you look at the quarter and if you look at year-on-year, it continues to be incrementally more investment from a P&L standpoint. It helps identicals. All the maturity that we're seeing on some of the early locations continues to have us feel comfortable that in a 3- to 5-year period for a store, you're really indifferent and it just becomes one more offer for the customer and that's really what we're focused on and we pay a lot of attention. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we think it's incredibly critical to provide a seamless experience because the customer does still continue to come inside our stores. Shane Higgins : And are you seeing -- this progression, does it look similar to what you've seen at the Harris Teeter stores where, I believe, you guys have offered this or, prior to your acquisition of the company, they'd offered it for a number of years? W. McMullen: That's very, very much so. And as you know, when we merged with Harris Teeter and we saw their insights, it's what caused us to aggressively start doing ClickList. And then, we think the only changes we made was asking the Harris Teeter team, if you had to do it over again, what would you differently? Those things we have done, but the patterns that we're seeing would be very similar to what we saw -- what Harris Teeter saw before we merged and what Harris Teeter continues to see. Shane Higgins : Great. And I just had a -- just a question, a housekeeping question on cost inflation. Mike, I might have missed it. Did you actually give a number for the cost inflation during the third quarter? J. Schlotman: About 50 basis points. Shane Higgins : 50? J. Schlotman: Yes, sir. 5-0. Operator : Our next question comes from Edward Kelly from Wells Fargo. Edward Kelly : Rodney, can we just start with -- on the IDs, could you just kind of walk us through the cadence of the IDs through the quarter and then what you're seeing so far in Q4? I mean, your commentary around a better number than the 1.1% suggested, you're higher than that now, but I just -- your thoughts there would be good. W. McMullen: Yes. The -- if you look at it during the quarter, it was very balanced across the quarter, nothing that would jump out one way or the other. We had traffic growth throughout the quarter. If you look at the household growth and things like that, it was pretty consistent. And we continue to see that so far in the fourth quarter. It's a nice, steady balance moving in the right direction. Edward Kelly : So in Q4 so far, though, Rodney, are you above the 1.1%? Is that why you guide it that way? W. McMullen: Well, if you -- as you look day-to-day, it's hard to see, but we would be very similar to that. J. Schlotman: It certainly supports the guidance we gave. Right. Edward Kelly : Okay. And then, Mike, just a question on you on leverage ratio. So when you bring the math underfunding on balance sheet, the rating agencies obviously already know all this information and they've thought about this when they've looked at you in the past and assuming ratings. So does what you're doing at all have any impact on the way that you're thinking about allocating cash flow over time? J. Schlotman: It really doesn't. The -- as we have more opportunities and negotiate more opportunities, if I could get all of these union contracts, I probably wouldn't want to do it in one fell swoop. It's -- like I said in my prepared remarks, it's one step at a time on a big endeavor like this. I would prefer to bring them all on balance sheet, manage the assets myself, get rid of a lot of friction costs. One of the funds we consolidated -- and it was unbelievable the management fees that we're paying because their assets were so low. And as you get a bigger pool of assets going after the same goal, you obviously get better fees. So there's lots of ways that it's reduced our costs.  And generally speaking, the rating agencies do get it and understand it. It's -- I'll think out loud just for a second and everybody in the room just kind of looked at me like \"Uh-oh\", but we've actually talked. Should we start talking about a leverage ratio closer to exactly how the rating agencies do it? So there isn't this disconnect between the 2,and we just put everything out there the way we believe they looked at it. They don't tell you everything, but -- and then, it's not volatile as it seems when we add something. So that's something we're kicking around just to take some of the what seems like a growth in our leverage when it's just moving it from one part to another. Edward Kelly : And just lastly for you, Mike. How do you see the allocation of the proceeds from the C-store sale sort of playing out related to repo or debt reduction? J. Schlotman: We'll -- I think I would just go back to what our strategy is and we would allocate our -- those proceeds to support all the pillars of our financial strategy, keeping in mind the contribution to the bottom line that those stores did generate as well as the need to get our leverage ratio down some. W. McMullen: It will be a balance between -- of all pieces. J. Schlotman: Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Erica Eiler : This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. So I actually had a question on pharmacy. So there's been a lot of speculation lately with a new player potentially entering the pharmacy space and others such as CVS discussing plans to offer next-day delivery. So just curious whether pharmacy delivery is something your customers are requesting and your ability to potentially offer this convenience down the road and just the competitive dynamics just surrounding kind of this speculation. W. McMullen: Well, the -- in terms of delivery, we, in some places, we already offer delivery. The customer request is enough. Going forward, as it becomes something that's more important, we'll be able to leverage it on the infrastructure that we're putting in place for ClickList on delivery. The -- for us, one of the things that -- we like the pharmacy business. It continues to improve and grow because we're able to help people eat healthier as well. And our 84.51\u00b0 and our pharmacy teams are really working hard. Our health and wellness team is really working hard on how do we help customers eat healthier on their terms because we know the flavor profiles people like. And we're actually doing some things now in testing with our associates. And once our associates give us feedback, then we'll expand and provide that to the customer as well. So we really feel good about the opportunity going forward by leveraging all the insights that we have. Erica Eiler : Okay. And then, just switching gears to the hurricanes during the quarter, are you able to quantify the comp lift you saw in the quarter? And any impact to earnings that you saw from the hurricanes? J. Schlotman: Well, the expense that we incurred did not penetrate our insurance deductible. So it was contained at less than the $26 million I spoke of last quarter. It was in the $20 million to $25 million range. And when you think about where the hurricanes hit and where we have stores, while it certainly helped the Houston division sales, the overall effect on the total company, given we have 2,800 stores and 100 or so affected in Texas by the storm, was relatively negligible to the overall number. Operator : Our next question comes from Ken Goldman from JP Morgan. Kenneth Goldman : Mike, you said you were significantly more diligent, if I'm quoting you right, in lowering cost of vendors. And I have a couple questions about this. First, I'm just curious, can you provide some color on what this means in practical purposes? What have you done in terms of your negotiations with vendors that's working for you? And I'm talking prices, not just really fill rates.  And then, second, the food at home industry, the manufacturers have much higher margins than the grocers. And usually in any supply chain, those higher-margin players have the leverage. But you and some of your competitors, you're doing things lately, you're pressing on prices. You're asking for better delivery times. You're demanding it, right? That kind of suggests your leverage is a little bit stronger than what I might have thought. Otherwise, I guess, your vendors would just say no. We won't pay these fees. We won't lower our prices. So forgive the long question, but does this imply that maybe because of more private label, whatever else you're doing to distinguish yourselves, that sort of power tide is shifting a little bit in favor of the retailers? Or is that... J. Schlotman: We've never really tried to look at it as a power struggle and we really appreciate the partnerships we have with our CPG suppliers.  Relative to the fine to the late trucks, it doesn't do us any good to have folks around our warehouse expecting trucks to show up and the truck doesn't show up or that we have orders in for product from our stores and we get a truck from a supplier that doesn't have all of the goods on it we expected it to have on it. And not only are we incurring the cost at the warehouse for those idle workers, but it also winds up affecting sales when we can't fulfill the orders that our stores have asked for and then we can wind up with out of stocks or low stock inside the store. And it's really just trying to strengthen that relationship. If it's supposed to get here today and it's supposed to be a full truckload, you know, get it to us today and make it a full truckload. This isn't within minutes of a window. This is a relatively wide window at this point.  And I would say the biggest thing on cost of goods is we've always, at the category manager level, done a really good job of negotiating cost of goods. There had been times when they've made decisions historically that somewhere up the chain in the company we may have overturned a decision they made, which causes them to think, \"Well, somebody doesn't have my back when I negotiate really diligently and get us a better cost of goods on a product.\" I can tell you today, the category manager negotiates a price or a product in our store or not in our store. That decision stands there because they're the ones with all the data and information about how that decision is made. It's all of those decisions are made. We don't just do this, give us the best price or you're out of the store. It's all made with the powerful data of 84.51\u00b0 behind it to understand consumer preferences and substitutability and things like that. So it's a pretty broad-based approach and I would say those 2 generally are the highlights. W. McMullen: We really do try to work with our partners on taking costs out of both of our systems and then giving that to the customer. We're very transparent in terms of the way we're negotiating and why we negotiate what we do. And the data, as Mike mentioned, is incredibly important to understand how does the customer view each item and what's the substitutability across items? And that's how we use what we do, but we do it in a very transparent way. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : I just wanted to talk about the fourth quarter and general merchandise, a little off topic here. But just wondering if I was going to go and buy a TV or something from Fred Meyer up in Seattle, can I get that delivered? In other words, can I buy it online and have it shipped to my home? I was on the website. It didn't seem like that ability was there and I just wanted to see if it is and I'm missing it, just kind of some sort of clarity. J. Schlotman: Our ship to home is an evolving process, Scott. And as we said in our conference call and in the prepared remarks, we had a record Black Friday and Fred Meyer had a record Black Friday. And when you talk about TVs, that's a record Black Friday relative to a few years ago where electronics would have been a huge part of their Black Fridays. And it's -- not every customer wants things delivered to their house. There's still a joy and excitement of going out and shopping for things and we'll continue to offer and, over time, offer more opportunities and options for our customers on how they want products delivered. But when you think about this year's Black Friday being a record year, I think folks claiming brick-and-mortar is dead and everything is going to get shipped to home are a little bit ahead of themselves. W. McMullen: The other thing, as we mentioned last month at the investor meeting, you have a certain amount of resources and we're doubling down on food and making sure that we're doing everything we can on food. We will start addressing things beyond just food. But first of all, we just wanted to make sure that we got food positioned appropriately so. Scott Mushkin : Okay. So that is a good transition to my next comment because obviously store traffic for general merchandise was down quite a bit last holiday. It could be down quite a bit this holiday if some of the early numbers are verified. So, I guess, you guys called out the 1.1% comp. And, I guess, from an analyst perspective, when we just say Costco put up, adjusting for a calendar shift, a 7%, some of -- your largest competitor, Walmart, I think told us that their food comps are best they've seen in years and above their 2.7% that they reported. So, I guess, I'm just trying to understand, especially with the gross margins being up so much in the quarter, why your sales seem to be lagging in an economy that's just racing and how you guys want to frame -- would frame it? I mean, clearly, again, some traditional supermarkets are doing okay, but net-net on the entire economy, it doesn't look good at all. And I was just wondering if you had any thoughts on that. W. McMullen: Well, as we mentioned in our call, overall in identicals, we felt good about the progress we continue to make. We continue to focus on improving that. Tonnage improved more than the number. As you know, as customers switch to our Own Brands, the retail price of that item is less as well. So there is some of those things that's within the numbers.  Now, with that said, we are not satisfied with where our identicals are and we continue to push to improve our identicals from where we are and see a lot of exciting opportunities to do that. Scott Mushkin : And, Rodney, do you worry another -- the CEO of Hy-Vee was talking about maybe these big stores don't work. They've stopped going into Minneapolis, with their 90,000 to 105,000 and they're building actually 2 fulfillment centers, e-commerce fulfillment centers. Would you worry a little bit about the asset and that the center of the store is going to transition more and more online? And then, I'll yield. W. McMullen: Scott, yes. It's kind of fascinating. So far, if you look at our big stores, they continue to perform very, very well and our customers tell us they like them. Now, one of the things that's incredibly important is what you put inside of that store and how long does it take to shop the store and things like that. And what we have found is actually the flexibility of the store actually allows you to change it a lot. So if you look at how we use the inside of the space, we significantly allocate additional space for fresh departments today versus what we would have 2 or 3 or 4 years ago.  It's -- in terms -- you started out your question, do you worry? I worry about everything. But what we're seeing is the customer continues to connect well with that format and what is really important for the customer is the ability to shop inside of a store when they want, the ability to pick up when they want and, in some cases, get it delivered. So it's really all those things together is what our customers are telling us and showing us.  In certain parts of the store, the middle is declining, but I can tell you pets and some of those categories are continuing to have great growth. So you don't use the space the same as what used to use it either. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Prykull from Goldman Sachs. Christopher Prykull : Can you provide any more details as to how space optimization at the initial stores is progressing? And maybe specifically, how do you think about the sales elasticity of promotions in center store relative to perishables today versus maybe 3, 4, 5 years ago? And does that factor into your space optimization efforts and how you think about utilizing vendor allowances and price investments by category going forward? W. McMullen: The space optimization so far continues to make good progress. If you went to a store that's been changed, if you talk to our store teams, they would give you a whole list of things that they were surprised about what was done and they would also tell you, after they got used to it and the customer got used to it, they actually liked the changes. And there's as many things that's operationally focused as helping to have better variety stay in stock, some of those things for our customers. The allowances that a vendor would give us would not be something that would cause us to affect space optimization, but what -- obviously, we look at profitability by vendor, profitability by item. And whether you carry an item and things like that would be things that you would certainly be in negotiations with.  On pricing elasticity, it really depends. Every store would actually have different pricing elasticity as every customer behaves differently. And it's one of the reasons why we think the 84.51\u00b0 insights are so important and critical is being able to connect with that customer one-on-one versus a group. Christopher Prykull : Great. That's helpful. And then, maybe just a follow-up to Scott's question. Can you give any further details as to how you envision your store footprint, both the size of the box and maybe the number longer term, particularly given your greater focus on share of stomach as opposed to traditional food at home as well as online? Does the look of a Kroger store evolve over time? W. McMullen: Well, the look of a Kroger store always evolves over time. And the other day, I was in one of our Marketplace stores that I think the store is 4, 5 years old and we just took a lot of this work from space optimization and put it into the store. So the store wasn't very old, but we made a lot of changes to it. So going forward, I would be -- I would totally expect that to continue to be the case.  I believe when you look at -- going forward, you'll see a broader range of physical stores, but customer -- I think you'll continue to have all of the above because if you look at stores where we have a very developed ClickList, there are certain times where customers typically shop more than one of our stores. Sometimes, they'll shop a big store. Sometimes, they'll shop a small store and it really depends on their mission. And they'll use ClickList as well. So we would continue to believe that it's very important to have multiple size stores going forward. Christopher Prykull : Great. That's helpful. And then, just one housekeeping, if I could. I may have missed it in the 8-K, but as part of your fiscal '18 outlook, did you -- do you expect full year FIFO operating margin ex-fuel to be up or down? J. Schlotman: Didn't go there. Christopher Prykull : Got it. J. Schlotman: Just dollars, yes. Operator : And our final question comes from Chris Mandeville from Jefferies. Chris  Mandeville: Rodney, just thinking about some of the newer initiatives that were referenced in the press release, programs like info dining, private label flowers, apparel, I know they're not needle movers by any means, but I'm wondering if you could kind of take us through your thought process on why you've decided to allocate capital to these little areas as opposed to maybe partner up or acquire your way into some of these businesses, established brands? And then, I guess, inversely, I'm sure the capital demand is quite different, but why did you choose to partner on delivery when we know that controlling that relationship with the end customer is so important? W. McMullen: Yes. So for us, on delivery, the way that we've partnered, we still have the relationship with a customer and we decide which third party to deliver because the point that you made is the reason that we always want to make sure that the relationship stays with us versus a third party.  In terms of -- on some of the other things, why we did it on our own versus partnering with somebody, we would always, when we decide to do something, evaluate and look at whether we should partner with someone or not. It's -- a lot of times, it's finding the right person to partner with and that's usually just as hard as anything else because you have to have somebody that really believes that 2 plus 2 will equal 5 or 10 or something and that you share accordingly and that's always hard to do. So we're always open and we will seek to partner with somebody when they will accelerate what we're doing. So if you think about some of the delivery things, those relationships, the reason we did it is it accelerated what we were able to do. So we're very open to third-party relationships, but it really has to be something that works for both. Chris  Mandeville: Okay. And then, just lastly, I know you weren't willing to necessarily go there at the Analyst Day, but are you willing to disclose online sales in total at this point? It's nice to see the percentage gains, but they don't really tell us all that much.  And then, Rodney, you used the phrase a unique relationship with Instacart. I'm not sure if I'm reading into that at all, but did you mean anything by that in terms of you having a different relationship with them versus other retailers? W. McMullen: The -- in terms of our overall digital business, at this point, we would not break out the dollars. It is becoming something that's reasonable in size, but -- and at some point in the future, we will be willing to break it out, but today, we just think -- don't think it's that helpful. In terms of the reason I said a unique relationship, it really was a relationship that we felt that works for us and works for Instacart and it allows both of us to grow our business. I don't know enough about their relationships with other retailers to be able to compare them, but for us, the thing that was really important was something but leveraged their experience in technology and people that leveraged our assets and we kept the relationship with the customer. So that was what we did and it was -- it's unique in terms of we really view that it will help both of us continue to grow our business.  Before we end today's call, as you know, I always like to share some additional thoughts with our associates listening in. To live our purpose pillar of Restock Kroger is what make -- what you make possible every day. By uplifting each other, our customers and our communities, Kroger's Zero Hunger | Zero Waste plan is our vision to end hunger in the communities we call home and eliminate waste across the company by 2025.  Last week, the day before Thanksgiving, I had the good fortune to celebrate Friendsgiving with our Roundy's team in Wisconsin. I also had the chance to personally visit a couple of local food pantries plus a really cool, innovative mobile market. And the mobile market is a former NASCAR trailer converted into a fresh grocery store that goes twice a day to underserved neighborhoods around Milwaukee, really cool stuff, really cool partnership. And that's just one example. And as I have the opportunity to be with our team and seeing how much we do in just one division for so many people that's in need, it really takes my personal gratitude to a whole new level. I also happen to know that The Kroger Foundation just donated a brand-new truck to Feeding America Southwest Virginia food bank in our mid-Atlantic region. And it actually came complete with a big red bow for the holidays. I was equally impressed to learn that in only 24 hours on Giving Tuesday, our associates and customers helped us donate over 1 million meals through social media.  The generosity of our associates and customers never ceases to amaze me and inspire me. It's just simply wonderful. This is what it really means to live our purpose, to Feed the Human Spirit.  Thank you for all you do each and every day. I wish you and your family a Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays.  That completes our call today. Thanks for joining. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, the conference call has now concluded. We do thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Kate Ward, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Kate Ward : Thanks, Gary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our fourth quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. W. McMullen: Thank you, Kate. And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me to review Kroger's fourth quarter and full year 2017 results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman.  At our investor conference in October, we discussed the need for retail companies to constantly reinvent themselves in order to remain relevant, and Kroger is right in the middle of such a reinvention. We are proactively addressing customer changes, and we've made strategic decisions to invest in a seamless digital experience, technology, associate wages and low prices. Combined, these efforts come together in Restock Kroger, our plan to create shareholder value by redefining how people eat. Our vision is to serve America through food inspiration and uplift. Restock Kroger has 4 main drivers : redefine the grocery customer experience, expand partnerships to create customer value, develop talent and live our purpose. Combined, these focus areas will create shareholder value.  We announced Restock Kroger 6 months ago while also in the middle of one of the most complicated years in our history. Throughout 2017, we continue to challenge our team to deliver our revised identical sales and earnings guidance from June. We are proud to share today that we delivered on those revised commitments for the year, finishing 2017 with strong sales and business momentum.  In 2017, we also grew digital sales by more than 90% and expanded ClickList to more than 1,000 locations. We gained market share for the 13th consecutive year, achieved $16.7 billion in annual natural and organic sales, including $2 billion in Simple Truth sales. We launched Zero Hunger | Zero Waste, our commitment to end hunger in the places we call home and eliminate waste across our business by 2025, and created 10,000 new American jobs in our supermarket locations across the country. All of this is encouraging as we start 2018. Looking at 2018 and beyond, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is a catalyst that will enable us to accelerate investments in Restock Kroger. And as we've shared a few times since the fall, we are taking a balanced approach to ensure tax reform benefits our associates, customers and shareholders. Shareholders will benefit from approximately 1/3 of the tax savings flowing through the net earnings per diluted share. For our customers, we'll make strategic investments to continue redefining the grocery customer experience through a combination of improved services, lower prices and added convenience. And for our associates, we are developing plans now to invest in long-term benefits, including education, wages and retirement. We are looking at ways to differentiate our associate experience with the underlying philosophy that we want to provide more than a onetime award. We want to make investments in our associates' future. As an example of this, we are doing a lot of work right now to develop an industry-leading education offering for associates. Kroger has always been a place where people can come for a job and save for a career. We believe an enhanced commitment to employee education will drive the Develop Talent focus area of our plan. These investments underpin and accelerate Restock Kroger, which means we fully expect a strong return from each. Sharing the benefits with our associates and customers will create a more sustainable and stronger business model to support Kroger's future. The investments are also aligned with our purpose, our promise and our values. We look forward to sharing more details on our plans with associates in the coming weeks.  We continue to create a seamless environment where our customers can choose how to engage with us in-store and online. Whether through ClickList or home delivery, we continue to test, learn and scale what works using our data and customer insights to make it really easy for our customers to navigate across the channels they choose when shopping with us.  In the fourth quarter, we introduced a seamless digital shopping experience that fully integrates our ClickList experiences with our other digital services : coupons, recipes, rewards and more. After just a couple of months, we already know our customers love it. Customers are making purchases on the site at a higher frequency than before and spending more per online order. Households that participate in our seamless offerings, those who engage with our digital platforms and our physical stores, spend more per week than households that do not. And households that transact with us online spend even more. These results further validate our hypothesis, which has always been that customers want to have options for how they shop with us, and that hypothesis continues to shape our strategy to further accelerate our digital and e-commerce efforts. When you look at our customer coverage areas for seamless shopping, more than 2/3 of our customers, more than 40 million shoppers, have pickup and/or delivery available from Kroger. Our goal is for every customer to have access to our convenient services. In 2018, we will expand our digital coverage area and enhance our digital shopping experience to provide customers with relevant products, recipes, digital coupons, weekly ads, smart shopping lists and much more. To support this growth, we offer customers 1,091 pickup locations and more than 872 delivery locations across the country, and it continues to grow.  Next, I'd like to discuss how we're winning with Our Brands, and this helps Kroger redefine the customer experience. Our Brands' performance this past year was extraordinary, and I'll share just a few of the highlights. In 2017, Our Brands achieved its highest-ever unit share. We reached $20.9 billion in total sales and reached $2 billion in annual Simple Truth sales, which to me is even all the more remarkable when you consider that the brand is only 5 years old. We also announced a partnership with Fair Trade U.S.A. Simple Truth now offers more Fair Trade Certified products than any other private-label brand in the country. For the fourth quarter, Our Brands made up 29.5% of unit sales and 26% of sales dollars, excluding fuel and pharmacy.  I think it's incredibly easy to take this success for granted, but I've seen the energy our teams have put into creating the right items, and it's really a big deal that an independent third-party research has validated the progress that we've made. When you look at the results, they are extraordinary, and I'm incredibly proud of our team. The data is clear. Customers love Our Brands better than the national brands and better than other private-label offerings. Our Brands outperformed even the private-label brands you immediately think of as best in class. And we're going to shout about it so our customers who have yet to experience Our Brands no longer will miss out. We will be particularly focused on our top brands : Kroger, Private Selection and Simple Truth. Our customers will be treated to an amazing array of enticing our new brand product introductions throughout the year, an assortment that will add excitement and simplify -- simplicity to their lives, all at amazing prices. And Our Brands are only available at Kroger. This is why Our Brands play such a pivotal role in Restock Kroger.  Restock Kroger is off to a great start. Our leadership team and associates are aligned behind that effort, which is further reinforced by our annual incentive plan. Customers are letting us know that they see, feel and appreciate our efforts to redefine the customer experience. And they continue to reward us with growing loyalty. This is the cycle that creates value for shareholders. We are confident that we will grow identical supermarket sales and market share in 2018, and we will create shareholder value by generating incremental operating margin dollars and free cash flow over the next 3 years.  Now here is Mike to share more details on our fourth quarter fiscal 2017 results and discuss our 2018 guidance. Mike? J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Over the next 3 years, Restock Kroger will be fueled by cost savings that we will invest in associates, customers and infrastructure. Our goal is to continue generating shareholder value even as we make strategic investments to grow our business.  We expect Restock Kroger to generate $6.5 billion of free cash flow over the next 3 years. This is before dividends and considers the benefit of the tax plan. If you recall at the conference, we talked about $4 billion after dividends. This has been converted to a more conventional free dividend free cash flow calculation, so we're trying to be a little more conventional in the number we talk about. As you know, we've already reprioritized the way we invest capital over the next 3 years by both reducing the amount we spend and optimizing our capital allocation process. We now look first for sales-driving and cost-savings opportunities across brick and mortar and digital platforms. Second, we will continue to make sure our logistics and technology platforms keep pace with and scale to these demands through continued investment. Finally, we will allocate capital to storing activity. This process has allowed us to use less free cash flow for capital investments. We're aggressively managing OG&A costs and implementing new programs to reduce our cost of goods sold. A big focus will be on store productivity and waste. Both of these will benefit from the $9 billion in capital investment over the next 3 years. For example, store productivity will improve with the scheduled launch of Scan, Bag, Go in 400 new locations this year, and we are also pleased that Shrink continued its steady improvement throughout the year with good results in the fourth quarter.  We plan to generate $400 million of incremental operating margin from 2018 to 2020. We are taking advantage of the lower federal taxes under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to pull investments forward to 2018, so we can move even faster on Restock Kroger than originally anticipated.  Turning to our results for the year. As you know, we revised our outlook in June to address the environment we're operating in. We've provided a narrow net earnings guidance range of $2 to $2.05 per diluted share, and we are pleased to have been near the top end of that range for the year. As you can imagine in a company our size, there are many moving parts in our operations. Our goal is to manage the business on at least an annual cycle period. This can lead to quarterly fluctuations, but we always have our eye firmly on annual results and the long-term strength of the company. We saw an opportunity at the beginning of the quarter to invest in the shopping experience and price while still delivering on our annual commitment. This is why our results reflected a gross profit rate decline of 31 basis points in the fourth quarter but only 19 basis points for the year. As a result of these investments, we saw growth in both households and total visits, unit growth and market share growth. Since 2000, we've invested -- we've reduced prices for our customers by $4.1 billion. We intend to continue investing in price to drive unit and ID sales growth while delivering on the bottom line for our shareholders. This is the strategy we've been following for years, and it has served us well over time. It is a cornerstone of our Restock Kroger plan to invest more in redefining the shopping experience, partnering for customer value and developing talent that will be paid for by costs of good savings, strong IDs and productivity gains. This is where the incremental operating profit margin will come from over the next 3 years.  We continue to make investments in our associates through both higher wages and additional hours for ClickList and other services. In fact, those 2 categories accounted for about half of the increase in OG&A in the quarter, and we continue to be pleased with the results we're seeing from those investments. Despite higher inflation during the fourth quarter, LIFO turned out to be a tailwind due to lower inventory levels in departments most affected by higher inflation, primarily pharmacy. Speaking specifically about ID sales, we're very pleased with the result of the 1.5% growth in the fourth quarter. Several departments outperformed the company in the fourth quarter, including produce, deli fresh prepared, meat and seafood. Our Natural Foods Department continued to generate strong double-digit growth in both the fourth quarter and full year. 18 of our 22 supermarket-operating divisions had positive IDs for the year as well, demonstrating the consistency of our results across the enterprise. Kroger's market share grew for the 13th year in a row in 2017. Our consistent market share gains drove both top and bottom line growth to generate lasting shareholder value. We report our market share annually and look at it the way customers would look at it : where do they spend their money? We use market share data as a directional measure and not a specific one. It's also worth noting that market share is calculated based on total sales and not ID sales. According to IRI point-of-sale data, Kroger's overall market share of the products we sell in the markets where we operate grew approximately 21 basis points in 2017, a slight acceleration over last year's growth of 16 basis points based on IRI's calculations. Both our fourth quarter and full year results included several adjustment items described in Table 6 from this morning's press release. I want to spend a couple of minutes walking you through that table.  These items are not included in our fourth quarter adjusted net earnings per diluted share result of $0.63, and they are not included in our 2017 adjusted net earnings results of $2.04. So none of these items were included in our $0.63. I think there's a little confusion about that from some folks that some of these numbers might have been in there. As a result of the Tax Act, we recognized a tax benefit of $922 million in the fourth quarter. This was due to the remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities and the reduction of our statutory income tax rate for the last few weeks of the fiscal year. As part of the company's annual review of goodwill balances in the fourth quarter, we recognized an impairment charge of approximately $110 million related to our Kroger specialty pharmacy business. This is primarily due to lower rebates and gross margins that we built into our future expectations. Kroger specialty pharmacy continues to perform well. In the third quarter of 2017, certain assets and liabilities, primarily those related to our Convenience Store business, were classified as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheet. Due to these assets being classified as held for sale, these are no longer being depreciated. We benefited from this classification in both the fourth quarter of '17 and fiscal 2017 by not having to record the $19 million of depreciation associated with those assets.  Our results were also affected by the previously announced settlement of obligations under the company-sponsored pension plan. We also made significant headway throughout the year, in fourth quarter in particular, on our long-term effort to address exposure in our pension plans while, at the same time, working with unions to provide Kroger associates with a more secure pension. During 2017, we proactively managed future risk in several ways. Most recently in December, Kroger and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters arrest -- announced the ratification of a new labor agreement that provided for Kroger's withdrawal from the Central States pension fund. We recognized a $351 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with this withdrawal. And subsequently, we've negotiated a lump-sum settlement for that, that I'll touch on in a moment. This was in addition to the $192 million recognized in the first quarter of 2017 for the obligation associated with the planned withdrawal of Roundy's associates from the same fund and a $7 million charge for a separate multi-employer pension fund. As I said a minute ago, we made a lump-sum payment to Central States in the fourth quarter. This totaled $467 million pretax. This replaces what would have been an approximately $3 million per month pretax withdrawal obligation payment over the next 20 years.  In the third quarter, we announced the $1 billion contribution to our company-sponsored pension plan. This funded a $502 million settlement charge accounted for in the fourth quarter for the termination of the cash balance company-sponsored pension plan that we previously announced. So we funded it in the third quarter, terminated it in the fourth quarter, which is why the charge occurred in the fourth quarter.  Fuel performance was very good in the fourth quarter. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.198 compared to $0.172 in the same quarter last year. The average retail price of fuel was $2.46 versus $2.18 in the same quarter last year. For 2017, our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.206 compared to $0.171 the year before. And average retail price of fuel for all of 2017 was $2.36 versus $2.10 in 2016.  In February, we announced a definitive agreement for the sale of our Convenience Store business to EG Group for $2.15 billion. Our Convenience Store business has been part of the company for many years, and I can't stress enough how important they have been to our -- to Kroger's success both the management and the associates at the store level and in the office. We have been impressed with EG Group's professionalism, commitment to people and understanding of the U.S. convenience retail market. We're very pleased EG Group plans to establish their North American headquarters in Cincinnati. We continue to expect to close the transaction during the first quarter of our fiscal year, and we look forward to working with them closely to ensure a smooth transition for associates. As we've previously announced, we plan to use the proceeds of the sale to repurchase shares and lower our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio.  Our financial strategy is to use our free cash flow to drive growth while also maintaining our current investment-grade debt rating and returning capital to shareholders. We can generally balance the use of cash flow to achieve these goals. In 2017, we used cash to contribute an incremental $1.2 billion pretax to company-sponsored pension plans and 464 -- $467 million pretax to satisfy the withdrawal obligations to the Central States Pension Fund. We also repurchased 61 million common shares for $1.6 billion. We paid $444 million in dividends and invested $3 billion in capital. At the end of the fourth quarter, our current share repurchase authorization had approximately $270 million remaining, and our return on invested capital for 2017 on a 52-week basis was 12.03%. We have said for some time that we expect our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to grow. This is because we're bringing an off-balance-sheet item onto our balance sheet for funding an obligation already on our balance sheet like we did with the company plan. As a result, in the third quarter, we updated our target range for this ratio to 2.2 to 2.4x. These obligations, whether recorded on or off Kroger's balance sheet, have generally been considered when our credit profile has been reviewed. But since they weren't funded, they previously did not get picked up in the net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio. The lump-sum settlement negotiated with the Central States Pension Fund in the fourth quarter is the most recent example of the company taking advantage of low interest rates and more favorable tax rates to secure the benefits -- the retirement benefits we promised to our associates. Because negotiating the settlement and bringing the obligation to our balance sheet was not contemplated when we updated our target last quarter, we're again updating our target range for this ratio to 2.3 to 2.5x. Just as in the past, this obligation has always been part of our credit profile. The funding in the fourth quarter now picks up this obligation in our net total debt amounts.  Our current result of 2.6x on a 52-week basis is above this range, due primarily to the funding of the above-mentioned pension obligations. We expect to use free cash flow and a portion of the proceeds from the sale of assets to get us back in this range. And as I said, this includes the sale of our Convenience Store business.  Protecting associate and retiree pensions is one significant way that we take care of our associates. Another is hiring and job creation. As we noted in this morning's press release, Kroger created 10,000 supermarket jobs in 2017. Through Restock Kroger, we are investing an incremental $500 million in our associates in wages, training and development over the next 3 years. This will be in addition to our continued efforts to rebalance pay and benefits while also focusing on certifications and performance incentives, career opportunities and training. Our store associates in our Cincinnati/Dayton division are currently voting on a tentative agreement between Kroger and the UFCW. This will be our first contract under Restock Kroger, and it includes an added investment in wages, raising the starting pay to at least $10 an hour and accelerating rate progression to $11 per hour after 1 year of service. These are the kinds of things we contemplated when we allocated $500 million to the talent portion of our Restock Kroger plan.  Looking ahead, we have several major negotiations in 2018, including contracts with the UFCW for store associates in Smith's in Albuquerque, Fred Meyer in Portland and Kroger stores in Richmond and Fort Wayne. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and the compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We continue to strive to make our overall benefit package relevant to today's associates. Our financial results continue to be pressured by inefficient health care and pension costs that some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions, which represent many of our associates, the importance of growing our business and profitably, which will help create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.  Turning now to our guidance for 2018. We expect 2019 -- 2018 identical supermarket sales growth, excluding fuel, to range from 1.5% to 2%. We expect net earnings to range from $1.95 to $2.15 per diluted share for 2018. We expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to be approximately $3 billion, and we expect our 2018 tax rate to be approximately 22%.  And now I'll turn it back to Rodney. W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike. We're proud of how our team finished 2017, ending the year with positive momentum in sales and the overall business. We delivered the revised sales and earnings guidance we promised, gained market share for the 13th row -- year in a row, continued to grow our natural and organic food sales, grew digital sales by more than 90% and now offer a seamless digital experience to more than 40 million customers in America. And of course, we relaunched Restock Kroger. As we embark on our first full year of implementing Restock Kroger, we are committed to continuing this great momentum. And we will only accelerate our efforts to redefine the grocery customer experience through investments in digital, technology, pricing and convenience; to expand partnerships to create customer value by forming meaningful alliances with partners who share our commitment to putting the customer first; to develop talent by investing in our associate wages and education; and to live our purpose through our purpose and promise and Zero Hunger | Zero Waste commitment. We are focused on these key drivers of Restock Kroger because we know when we execute them well, we will create shareholder value. We are encouraged at the start of 2018 and confident in our ability to deliver on both our plan for the year and our long-term vision to serve America through food inspiration and uplift.  Now we look forward to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Edward Kelly : So Rodney and Mike, I guess, the first thing I want to start with is on the gross margin because obviously that's the point, I think, that investors were probably most disappointed with this quarter. Can you just provide more color on what happened here? I mean, theoretically, you would have gotten a full quarter of the vendor initiative in Q4. Comparisons seemed a bit easier. It does seem like pockets of the country -- you're sort of hearing about things being at a minimum, not getting more promotional but actually probably getting a little bit better. Was the ramp in the price investment as aggressive as it looks? What's the thought process behind it? And then how do we think about all this for next year? Should we be extrapolating this gross margin down sort of like the way we saw in Q4? J. Schlotman: Well, relative to the last portion of your question, I think I would answer that the same way we answered the increase in the gross margin in the third quarter, that you should never really take any particular quarter and extrapolate it over any period of time other than that particular quarter. As I said in the prepared comments, yes, we were down 30-something basis points in the quarter but only 19 basis points in the year, which is a fairly normal kind of a reduction in investment in gross margins for us. I think that's more normal. We've been very open since October with Restock Kroger. When you look at the recent finds in the customer shopping experience key, that the investment in that key is going to be more than the dollars we generate from that, and that's going to be funded by other parts of it. There was a chart back in October that delineated how we expect to invest in the business and how we expect to generate revenue or EBITDA from those investments and leading to the $400 million increase in operating profit margin, just giving you a little more background than you maybe wanted of the journey we've been on since October. The short answer is you should expect gross margin to decline somewhat in 2018. We aren't giving guidance on the individual amounts. We've talked about the fact that 1/3 of the tax savings will be invested in the business, 1/3 will be invested in our associates and 1/3 will go to our bottom line. Obviously, those are below gross margin or operating -- that benefit to EPS is below the line, if you will. But again, we always try to balance to our annual expectations. W. McMullen: And one other -- a couple of things I would add to Mike's. Mike mentioned it, but we really focus on the gross margin overall for the year. When you look at the year and the work that we've done on Restock Kroger, we worked -- we are consistent with what we thought we would do with Restock Kroger. As I've said before, we're not going to lose on price, but we're not out there trying to lead the market down. And as you know, as part of Restock Kroger, we committed to improving operating margin dollars by $400 million over the next 3 years. And we remain, as Mike said, to that expectation of ourselves and we would continue to expect to grow going forward. The way we will finance that is continuing to take costs out of the business through cost of goods, through process changes. Mike mentioned the improvement that we had on Shrink, for example, as well. Edward Kelly : Okay. And just a follow-up as it pertains to reinvesting the tax since we're on that topic. Ever since I can remember from following you guys, the narrative has always been that your cost structure is uncompetitive because of unionization. Now it appears that the nonunionized players have to catch up. The thought process is maybe you should be spending a little bit less than what they are, but this actually doesn't seem to be the case. So could you just help us understand why your investment around the labor side actually kind of seems to be at a similar magnitude of what we're hearing around the rest of retail? W. McMullen: If you look at -- by far, and Mike mentioned it, the majority of our investment in labor has been in starting wages. And in the past, we've always had people very easily would come for a job and make it a career and understand, over time, there's wage progression. Over time, as jobs became very plentiful, that starting wage became more important. So we've meaningfully increased starting wages across the company. And a big chunk of the increase is there and the other huge chunk is the investment in labor that we're making on ClickList and the aggressive expansion and rollout of ClickList. I don't know, Mike, anything you want to add to that? J. Schlotman: Yes. And those 2 combined to be about half of the increase in the OG&A in the quarter. Operator : The next question comes from Karen Short with Barclays. Karen Short : I just wanted to clarify, first of all, did you give a tax dollar benefit amount before I ask my question? Because you didn't give one -- you didn't refute one on CNBC this morning, and it was $200 million. And I thought the dollars you were going to get was higher than that. J. Schlotman: Well, I will say that on CNBC this morning, that was a little bit all over the board. It didn't focus very much in the quarter. I actually didn't have a chance to respond to their number of $200 million, but it is higher than that. As we said in the prepared comments, we expect to invest 1/3 in the business, 1/3 for our associates and 1/3 in the bottom line. So in total, Karen, it's about $0.36, $0.37, somewhere in that range. So it's -- at the new tax rate, it takes about $11 million to pretax to have $0.01 a share. So it's somewhere around $400 million of benefit, and we're investing that 1/3, 1/3, 1/3. W. McMullen: And the investments we're making we've talked about in the call, we truly expect to return. And what it does -- what we did was accelerate some of the key parts of Restock Kroger. J. Schlotman: Yes. And we're moving some of them up so we can get the benefits sooner, and then the latter years won't be burdened by these investments because we've already taken care of them. Karen Short : Okay. So I guess that matters as it relates to your EPS. So when you look at your EPS guidance and you back in to EBIT, I guess, the numbers I get for EBIT for fiscal '18 or calendar '18 could be any -- down anywhere from 22 -- well, 15% to 22%. So I guess the first question I had on EBIT, is it fair to say that you'll be much more kind of at that low end in the first half given the accelerated D&A and then, I guess, the second half hopefully a little bit better? And then, I guess, what matters is what the core is doing because we can all take this $400 million and pay 2/3 of it, right? So 2/3 of that is part of the EBIT decline as opposed to the core decline, if that question makes sense. Is that the way to think about it? J. Schlotman: Yes. I'm not going to get into giving guidance on what our EBIT's going to be. If you notice in our 8-K, we didn't give guidance on our operating profit margin, primarily because of the conversation you're having, Karen, trying to predict exactly where it's going to be when that's up above and I'm paying for some of my investments with tax savings dollars down below. We are balanced to try to make the numbers we talked about, and our incentive plan will only kick in, in a big way if we make the numbers we talked about relative to our earnings per share guidance. I mean, we've been talking since way back in September. We said it again in November and I've -- or in December, and I've said it multiple times when webcast since that we didn't see anything for this year that would cause us to be below $1.80 and we were striving to be equal or slightly above on adjusted 52-week year. Well, a 52-week year is the $1.95 and then above that plus the $0.12 is -- so we did the $1.95 as the anchor rather than the $1.80. And then the $0.10 to $0.12 from the tax savings plus being slightly above it is how we got to the $2.15. Estimates out there, it's probably the widest range that I can ever remember. This morning when I looked, the range of estimates for next year were from $1.84 to $2.40. So there's clearly confusion about exactly what the number was going to be and how the tax savings dollars were going to fall. Karen Short : Okay. But it is fair to say, though, the first half, you have a much higher D&A, right? So the decline will be greater in the first half, all else equal, than it will be in the second half? And I guess, then the other question is on the investments in price or wages, is any of that front-end loaded? Or is it pretty evenly distributed? J. Schlotman: The depreciation for book won't be affected by the immediate deduction availability under the Tax Act. That would add -- we'll deduct -- if I buy a 7-year piece of equipment for book, I'll depreciate it over 7 years. For tax, I get it immediately. So that won't grow my deferred tax liability balance back up after I reduced it. So the D&A -- immediate expensing of D&A is only for tax, not the book. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Kenneth Goldman : Question on what you've talked about in terms of tax reinvestment. I think you mentioned that some of it will go to educating employees. And if I'm hearing you right, it sounds like the implication is that maybe you have a pool of money that's going toward your associates, some of it toward cash bonuses and some of it toward this education. And I get that from a long-term perspective, right? I'm just curious in a tight labor market, do you have data that really shows you the right move to sort of not spend all of that on bonuses or on raises? I'm just curious, you talked about some markets being $10 or $11 per hour. I think Costco said the average wages of their employees is over $22. So just thinking about that balance and any data you have that can help us understand that would be helpful. W. McMullen: Yes. In terms of our average wage, it is significantly higher than any of the numbers that we've talked about. And the other thing, I think, always to remember is that in addition to our average wage, we also provide health care and pension benefits to associates after -- as a general rule full time or when they haven't been -- after they've been here for a little while. We were very focused on not having something that was a onetime bonus but what were the things that our associates told us that's important to them and what are the reasons that they come to work for us. And when you look at people earlier in their career, the ability to have flexible hours and the ability to continue with an education was something that they give us feedback that was very important to them. So we really view that, that is an important part of investing in our associates. And it's something that we believe, as our associates gain skill, they will be more productive in terms of their day-to-day influence on Kroger and also help them move from a job to a career with us. So for us, it was really important for it not just to be a onetime headline number, but what is something that our associates view as incredibly valuable and helpful over time, and that was an area where associates told us they were important. As all of us know, people are increasingly worrying about college debt and the debt they take on, and this in a small way will be helpful for our associates as well. J. Schlotman: So Ken, to be clear, none of our 1/3 -- of tax-saving investment in our associates will be in the form of a bonus. We just don't think that's long lasting and drives retention or drives employee morale over the long term. We think that's temporary, gets a big headline and is somewhat fleeting. And we're trying to make our investment in things that will drive retention and morale over the longer term. Kenneth Goldman : That's very helpful. Can I just ask a quick follow-up? Mike, I appreciate you not wanting to give some of the guidance items that you typically in the past would have given. But there are certain items that maybe are unaffected by tax, fuel gross profit per gallon assumption, LIFO assumption, maybe some color on the current quarter. Any help you could give with that would be appreciated. J. Schlotman: Yes. I don't think we've typically given -- I guess we've given a range of margin per gallon. It's one of those things, Ken, we did make a conscious decision to skinny down the individual items we give guidance on. Because then every time it's -- the result's a little different than what you expect, that becomes the only talking point versus our promise is to deliver on Restock Kroger over the 3 years, to deliver the $6.5 billion of free cash flow, to deliver the $400 million in operating profit growth over the next 3 years; and as it relates to 2018 specifically, to have ID sales between 1.5% and 2% and earnings per share from $1.95 to $2.15. Every time we have to change one of those numbers in the 8-K, it becomes the talking point and sometimes the forest gets lost for the trees. Operator : The next question comes from Ben Bienvenu with Stephens Inc. Ben Bienvenu : Mike, I want to follow up on some comments -- or it could have been Rodney, some comments you made on the pull-forward of investments as it relates to Restock Kroger. My inference from the comment is that there's not also an associated pull-forward of the operating margin growth benefits that you would see as a result of those investments. So is it a correct interpretation of what you said to think that those benefits would accrue in years 2 and 3 of the plan versus concurrent with the pull-forward of investments in 2018? And to what extent is that to be reflected in your guidance? J. Schlotman: Yes. If you look at the way we even started talking about Restock Kroger back in October, it was always designed when you start looking at the numbers that -- and we have been giving guidance that our 2018 way back in September when we talked about not less than $1.80 and hopefully and we would strive to be flat to slightly above this year, the report of '17 numbers, it's pretty easy to assume that we weren't expecting operating margin dollar expansion with an earnings per share range like that. We've obviously updated it with the final results for this year, the final business plan for 2018 now completed as well as really good clarity on exactly how we're going to invest the tax savings dollars. The shorter answer is, yes, operating profit margin dollars will likely be down in 2018, and we're going to pull dollars forward out of '19 and '20 where the margin dollars should be higher. And we will pay for that for known, the known being the tax savings that are real dollars. And we are working diligently to deliver the savings dollars. We're pulling these dollars forward with real savings dollars that we effectively already have in the bank because of the lower tax dollars we're going to have to spend. This isn't designing a plan that's going to reduce Shrink by 10 basis points in 2018 and hope that -- I hate to use the word hope. I always quickly try to find a different one, but believing that we're going to be able to do that 10 basis point reduction and that was going to pay for our investments. From a cash flow standpoint, from an after-tax cash flow standpoint, we were absolutely neutral doing it this way. And it's going to benefit 2019 and 2020 when we make some of those investments this year, can still deliver the earnings per share growth and after-tax cash flow that we think we can deliver out of the plan. W. McMullen: And Ben, I don't know if this helps you. But one of the numbers Mike outlined in October was we expect cost reductions and savings of $4,450,000,000 over the next 3 years. That savings is what we would still expect. We have not included tax savings in that $4,450,000,000. And then if you look at what we plan to invest, the $4,450,000,000 that Mike talked about in October, our investment plan would still be the $4,450,000,000. We've just accelerated some of that into 98 -- or '08 where before it was an '09 or '10. J. Schlotman: '18 and '19. We moved it forward to '18 instead of '19 and '20. It's still -- we're still targeting the same numbers. We're still targeting the same operating profit margin growth at the end of 3 years, and we're still expecting the same free cash flow. And if you remember, on free cash flow, in fact, I talked about $6.5 billion. If you take what I talked about in October, it was $4.5 billion but that was reduced for $1.5 billion of dividends over the 3 years. So we've increased that by $500 million for some of the tax savings flowing into free cash flow. Ben Bienvenu : Okay. So just to summarize that, there's a pull-forward of the operating margin investments into this year versus what would have been over -- more steadily over 3 years, there's not a pull-forward of the operating growth, but it will be heavier in years 2 and 3 and paired with less operating margin investment in years 2 and 3? Is that the right way to think about it? J. Schlotman: Correct. And from an earnings per share standpoint, we're paying for that with a known increase in earnings per share from the lower tax rate. So we have to go out and figure out a lot of way to save. We know we're going to be able to pay for that from an earnings per share standpoint and a cash flow standpoint because these are real cash dollars with a lower tax payment. Ben Bienvenu : Awesome. And then a quick follow-up on freight. I didn't hear it mentioned in your comments. It's been a thematic touch point across the retail landscape over the last reporting period. To what extent is that impacting your gross margins? And how do you think about that cost pressure going forward? J. Schlotman: Yes. We're pretty well protected on freight. Obviously, we have our own captive fleet that delivers products from our warehouses to our stores. We have a little bit of third-party there, but they're under contracts. A lot of our inbound freight is under contracts that are being honored, and those folks typically have a good supply of drivers. There is a little bit we do on the spot market, and we're subject to some of the disruptions in a somewhat minor way on that. Relative to third party, the CPG companies, there are a few of them that are having disruptions in some of their freight. We've been pretty firm and pretty much still invest there as it's not our issue because we agreed to pay a certain price for the product and their obligation is to get it to us for that price. And we'll see how that evolves over the rest of this year. Operator : The next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : So Rodney, a question. Tactically, the 1/3 that you're going to invest in people, how do you do that in the context of the unionized business and contracts, right? So contracts that might be up next year, the year after, is most of the investment in contracts coming up this year? How do you deal with the contracts that have yet to expire in terms of wages or benefits? W. McMullen: In some cases, you may end up doing a contract early. But as Mike mentioned, like in the Cincinnati contract, that was -- part of what was negotiated was to increase starting wages and increase the progression during the first year. And we've been doing that as contracts have been coming up during 2017. But it's a -- your question is a great one, and it's one of those where you actually sit down with each local and have that conversation. And you target those conversations with places where your starting wage needs to be adjusted. We don't have where the starting wage needs to be adjusted across every part of the country, just parts of the country. John Heinbockel : And the 1/3 that you would invest in the business, how much of that is price or promotion? And when you think about the draw forward on some of these investments, is the comp outlook -- in your mind, is the comp outlook better in '19 and '20 versus what it would have been if you hadn't done this? And you probably want to quantify that, but how much better? W. McMullen: If you look -- I'm going to broaden my answer a little broader than just your question. Certainly, as we look out to 2019 and 2020, we increasingly see opportunities for the business to grow in a reasonable way. And if you think about our investments that we've been making in our digital and seamless experiences, on a year-on-year basis, that continues to be a headwind. At some point, late next year or early 2020, that will end up becoming something that's a tailwind because of process changes that we've made on reducing the cost of doing stuff and the growth in the customer in terms of what they spend with us. So when you look at all the pieces that we have together, we really see that we're positioning the company to start growing again as you start looking out to '19 and '20 and starting it out proactively, doing it in a position of strength as well. Operator : The next question comes from Vincent Sinisi with Morgan Stanley. Vincent Sinisi : Wanted to ask -- just in terms of margins for 2018, just to be sure, in terms of freight, what level -- or do you have some cushion baked in for -- I know you said you're relatively protected with what you own and a lot of the contract that's not so much on the spot market. But do you have some level of an increase in freight costs baked in there? And then also just on the vendor negotiations, which was obviously more of a topic last quarter, should we look at that as a potential for ongoing opportunities? Or was it just because maybe more kind of came due at once last quarter and, over time, you really haven't seen any notable changes there? J. Schlotman: Yes. I would say the performance -- the only time performance hasn't moved dramatically, defined amount was about the same in the fourth quarter as the third quarter. Relative to -- I won't get specific on transportation as a subset of my margin number. But as you can imagine in a company our size, pretty much everything we do is talked about in ranges. And then when we go to do our internal business plan, we pick a point estimate somewhere within that range. So pretty much everything has a range around it, just like transportation would be. And then you make a point estimate and put that into the model and you build everything else around it. And you move and tweak things to get to what we think is the right answer to strive for as a point estimate for the year. It's the reason we do earnings per share in a range. All of those kinds of things would result in the kind of range you see. W. McMullen: Yes. In terms of our team and the way we're partnering with our CPG partners on the vendor negotiation, there wouldn't have been any change in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. And from a talent standpoint and the way we've -- what we're negotiating, we've supplemented our team by some talent that we recruited from outside of the company. So we feel really good about where we are. We really do continue to view our CPG relationships as partnerships, but we will use our data to make sure that we understand the strength of each brand and each brand within a category and, as we're renegotiating, use that as part of the negotiation. And in all the backdrop is our own brands, the strength of them continues to improve, and we have very high ratings on net promotability index on it as well. Vincent Sinisi : Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then just one quick follow-up, if I can. For the C-store sale, I'm guessing at this point, nothing's really kind of specifically incorporated into your '18 outlook. But of course, we do know as you said kind of repurchases and debt paydown are the main priorities with the use of proceeds. Should we think of it as more of kind of, all right, those kind of begin in 2Q and kind of incrementally are spread, let's say, evenly across the future quarters? Or should we expect kind of more early on? Just any comments on that would be helpful. J. Schlotman: I know it would be helpful, but I won't explain exactly what our strategy is for repurchasing shares. I did have the opportunity to read a couple of the quick analyst reports that came out as the release crossed the wire. And one thing I want to clear up is our guidance range that's out there of $1.95 to $2.15 is with or without the C-Store sale. We will use the proceeds to reduce shares, to replace the EBITDA that goes away with that transaction. I'm not going to talk about the EBITDA level right now. And we will use a portion of those proceeds to reduce debt to balance our net total debt-to-EBITDA ratio out. So we built the plan so that whether we kept the C-Stores or sold the C-Stores, we would offset the lost EBITDA for the year by buying in shares, and then we'll use the rest to -- and other free cash flow to reduce debt to get our net total debt-to-EBITDA ratio in balance. Operator : And that question will come from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : Maybe first on the guidance. I'm guessing you probably won't answer, but we're getting a lot of questions in terms of how to think about the seasonality of EPS growth this year. So anything you can qualitatively give us color in terms of how you think about first half or second half EPS growth. J. Schlotman: Yes. It's -- I would go back to the earlier question on margin per gallon of fuel and where we think that might be and things like that. We really do run our business over the course of a year. And frankly, we try to run it a little bit -- over a little bit longer time frame than a year. But we do try to make sure that we have guidance out there that's relevant and meaningful to investors. My long-winded answer is I'm not going to give you a quarterly cadence. We are in this for the long haul. A quarter is 12 weeks long most times; the first quarter, 16 weeks long. And trying to say every quarter is going to be exactly X or exactly Y, I can tell you they rarely wind up exactly at X or exactly Y. And that's why we make modifications throughout the year. Sometimes we may need a little more. Sometimes we have a little extra, and do we take some to the bottom line? Do we invest some more? And we're constantly balancing that throughout the year. And we really try to do that on a rolling year basis, not just when I get midway through the year, I'm only worried about the second half. We're already thinking about the first half of next year. Rupesh Parikh : Okay, great. Then I guess, my real question for the call, so as you look at home delivery -- I know you guys recently expanded your partnership with Instacart at Ralphs. I was curious how that was going. And then just given some of their competitive developments out there, do you feel that as you look at where you guys are currently doing home delivery, that you need to accelerate your investment in this area going forward? W. McMullen: Well, as you know, if you go back a little over a year ago, we did home delivery almost in no stores, and now we're up to almost 900 stores. We would continue to look at home delivery as part of our offering. What we find is some customers like delivery, some customers like to have pickup and some customers like to go in store. And probably the most common thing is we find customers actually do all 3. And it just depends on what's going on in their life and whether they have a soccer practice to get to or from or whatever. So for us, you should expect to see us continually expanding the way customers can engage with us and do that digitally and with the mobile app. And we'll continue to make investments in those areas.  Hopefully, from Mike's and my comments and stuff, you can tell that we're incredibly excited about the future of Kroger. And when you look at Restock Kroger, the pieces of Restock Kroger are coming together exactly the way we would have hoped and get excited about. Our customers continue to tell us we're doing a better job, and our associates tell us that they're having more fun serving our customers. So all those pieces are coming together, and we continue to invest for the future in terms of the way we think customers will want to engage in a retailer 5 years from now, not just today. So hopefully, you could feel that excitement from our comments.  The other thing I'd like to do is just share a few additional comments with our associates listening in. Today, it's very fitting that it's International Women's Day. Kroger is proud to join organizations across the world to support and celebrate the social, economic, cultural and political achievements of women. This day is a great opportunity to live our purpose and demonstrate our values of diversity and inclusion by uplifting the women in our workplace. At our headquarters building in Cincinnati, we're joining with several other downtown companies in lighting up our building with the female symbol to celebrate women in business. And last night, we had it lit up, and it looked fabulous. I'd also want to encourage you to check out a video that we're sharing online both internally and externally that highlights several of our women executives. We are proud to be a workplace that works for women and to support their career aspirations and goals. This is what it really means to live our purpose : to Feed the Human Spirit. With St. Patrick's Day and a pretty big basketball tournament right around the corner, March is always fun and a fabulous celebration time of the year. I encourage you to take advantage of the opportunities we have to uplift our customers and each other every day and to help our customers have great celebrations, great parties and a great experience in our stores and through our digital experiences. Thank you for what you do each and every day. That completes our call today. Thanks for joining. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Rebekah Manis, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Rebekah Manis : Thank you, Laura. Good morning, and thank you for joining us.  Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our first quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com.  After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. W. McMullen: Thank you, Rebekah, and congratulations on your recent promotion to Director of Internal Relations. Mike and I really look forward to working with you in your new role on a closer basis.  Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me today to review Kroger's first quarter of 2018 results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman.  Restock Kroger is off to a great start. I'm especially proud of our team's execution of process changes that led to strong cost controls. We are committed to knowing and serving our customers so well that Kroger serves all of their shopping needs.  Our most fundamental strategy remains unchanged. As customers' tastes change and their shopping habits evolve, we will be there for them. That means we will make the investments needed to provide our customers with the best full-service grocery experience in America. Plus, we are investing in our associates more than ever before and seeing improvements in retention. We are creating a seamless environment where our customers can choose how to engage with us, both in-store and online. We are actively improving the store experience. Our space optimization work is ahead of schedule and Our Brands achieved another period of record growth while, at the same time, growing our digital sales by more than 66% in the first quarter which was due to our ongoing expansion of ClickList, our delivery initiatives and identical growth.  Our first quarter results enabled us to raise the low end of our EPS guidance for the year while also setting us up well to deliver on our identical sales target range for 2018.  As you know, Restock Kroger is our 3-year plan to create shareholder value by redefining how America eats. We are making progress in each of the 4 main drivers : Redefine the grocery customer experience, partner for customer value, develop talent and live our purpose. Using our deep insights and experience, Kroger is imagining the future of retail by building on our core business plus adding exciting and innovative partnerships like Ocado and our planned merger with Home Chef.  We believe the future of retail will include both physical and digital customer experiences. Everything we are doing today will enhance our ability to provide everyone in America with convenience of shopping for anything, anytime, anywhere.  We are incredibly excited that Kroger -- it is Kroger who is bringing Ocado's technology to the U.S. for the first time. The platform includes online ordering, automated fulfillment and home delivery capabilities. So it's a perfect fit with our vision and strategy. We look forward to innovating together with Ocado to enhance Kroger's digital and robotics capabilities and we are already working to identify the first 3 sites for development of the new automated warehouse facilities in the U.S. to deploy Ocado's proprietary technology and distribution expertise. Customers want convenience, simplicity and personalized food experience. Our planned merger with Home Chef will accelerate our ability to deliver exactly this. There is a lot that we admire about Home Chef. Their creativity and entrepreneurial energy and their use of data to connect with customers to name just a few. We believe that by taking over Kroger's meal solutions portfolio, Home Chef will bring our customers even more innovation and delicious offerings so customers can be the hero at mealtime. Pat and his team at Home Chef will be able to leverage Kroger assets, both our physical stores and data, to drive their business even more. And by joining forces, we can grow bigger together than either of us could have done alone.  We continue to execute our digital strategy through our core business as well. And as I've said before, the households that participate in our seamless offerings, those who engage with our digital platforms and our physical stores, spend more per week than households that do not and households that purchase from us online spend even more.  We have aggressively grown our existing seamless coverage to reach approximately 75% of our customers. This includes our network of ClickList locations, stores offering home delivery through Instacart and other partners as well as ship-to-home capabilities. Our goal is to reach 100% of our customers with the seamless experience and, over time, to reach all across America.  All the changes we are making to transform our business will make it even easier for families to share meals together. This business strategy enables us to live our Kroger purpose because we know that families who spend -- share meals together have even a better relationship and if they have children, they do better in all aspects of their life.  Our Brands is another example of how we're redefining the grocery customer experience. Kroger customers choose to put more Our Brands in their baskets and pantries every day. Our Brands grew faster than the national brands in nearly every department and gained significant share overall.  In the first quarter, Our Brands made up 28.7% of unit sales and 26.7% of sales dollars. In fact, Our Brands set the record for the highest ever retail dollar share in our history. Our Brands achieved a 5.1% sales growth at a 3.4% unit growth in the first quarter led by double-digit growth again in our popular Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic lines. Last quarter, we said that the federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would enable us to celebrate investments in Restock Kroger. This is possible because we are taking a balanced approach to how we are spending and investing the benefits. It's distributed evenly between our associates, our customers and our shareholders. This approach is in line with Kroger's purpose and is helping us make strategic investments and develop talent.  We are investing more than ever before in our associate experience. It all starts with the $0.5 billion investment in wages for many store associates that is part of Restock Kroger. We're also increasing the company's 401 contribution match to help associates retire with more money in their pockets plus expanding associate discounts to keep more money in their pockets today.  The one piece that I'm most excited about is Feed Your Future. Our new offer of up to $3,500 in annual tuition assistance to any associate who wants to attend classes to build a better future for themselves. Whether they're interested in completing a GED or an undergraduate degree, an MBA or a professional certification, associates can take advantage of up to $21,000 in total assistance as long as they have been with us for at least 6 months and that's on whether they're a full-time or part-time employee. As someone who got their start stocking shelves on the night shift in Lexington, Kentucky for Kroger in 1978, I can attest to education's life-changing power. I worked my way through college and, upon graduation, I was so proud to accept a full-time job with Kroger. The incredible learning experiences and work that makes a difference in people's daily lives has kept me here ever since.  Kroger has always been a place where people can come for a job and stay for a career. We believe that making education benefits available to more associates and at more generous levels than ever before is the best way to support their career and their future professional growth. And as part of Restock Kroger, we fully expect these investments will have an ROI that will create shareholder value.  We are in the process of transforming our business so that in the future, we can connect within -- with customers in ways that add more ease and convenience to their lives. To do this and to do it profitably, we must have an economic model that supports this transformation.  Kroger is better positioned than anyone to make this transformation because we have a set of unique and differentiating strengths. Kroger has more data than any of our competitors, which leads us to deep customer knowledge and [ unparelled ] personalization. We have incredibly convenient locations and platforms for pickup and delivery within 1 to 2 miles of our customers. We have a leadership team that combines broad experience with creativity and diversity of thought. We have the scale to win with more than 60 million households shopping with us annually. We connect personally with our associates, customers and communities to uplift and improve lives. And we have a proven track record of consistently returning capital to shareholders through an increasing dividend and share buyback program. Because of these strengths, we are on track to generate the free cash flow and incremental FIFO operating profit we committed to in Restock Kroger. We are confident in our ability to deliver on both our plan for the year and our long-term vision to serve America through food inspiration and uplift.  Now, here is Mike to share more details on our first quarter and update you on our guidance for 2018. Mike? J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. We are very pleased with our first quarter ID sales and earnings results. We did slightly better than our internal expectations. We completed the sale of our convenience stores business unit. And as Rodney said, we had one of the best cost control quarters in a long time due to implementing process changes.  This is important because over the next 3 years, Restock Kroger will be fueled by cost savings that we will invest in associates, customers and our infrastructure. Our goal is to continue generating shareholder value even as we make these strategic investments to grow our business.  We expect Restock Kroger to generate $6.5 billion of free cash flow over the next 3 years. This is before dividends and considers the benefit of the tax plan.  We've already re-prioritized the way we will invest capital over the next 3 years by both reducing the amount we spend and optimizing our capital allocation process. We now look first for sales-driving and cost savings opportunities across both brick-and-mortar and digital platforms. Second, we will continue to make sure our logistics and technology platforms keep pace with and scale these demands through continued investment. Finally, we will allocate capital to storing activity. This process has allowed us to use less free cash flow for capital investments. Our investment in Ocado is a great example of what's possible of our new approach to investing capital.  We continue to aggressively manage OG&A costs and implement new programs to reduce our cost of goods sold. A big focus continues to be on store productivity and waste. Our teams controlled shrink well in the first quarter. As we've said before, we won't leave a $0.01 on the table as we seek to reinvest savings to grow our business.  We plan to generate $400 million in incremental FIFO operating profit through 2020. We are taking advantage of the lower federal taxes under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to pull investments forward into 2018 so we can move even faster on Restock Kroger than originally anticipated. Our pull-forward investments in Restock Kroger began in the last 4 weeks of the first quarter. While the incremental 401(k) contribution match investment was retroactive to the first of the year, costs to support our new associate education program, Feed Your Future, had not begun in earnest. Our investments in wages will roll in as contracts are negotiated and the education payments will occur over time as associates take advantage of the opportunities to further their education.  We will make investments for the rest of the year to drive our strategy and keep prices low to retain our customers. As a reminder, since 2000, we've reduced prices to our customers by over $4 billion. We intend to continue investing in price to drive unit and ID sales growth while delivering on bottom line for our shareholders.  We manage our business every day to drive shareholder value. Our investments in Restock Kroger in defining the customer grocery experience, partnering for customer value and developing talent will be paid for by cost of goods savings, strong ID sales and productivity gains. This is precisely where the incremental FIFO operating profit will come from over the next 3 years.  For ID sales, we're pleased with our result for the first quarter. Several departments outperformed the company in the first quarter, most notably meat, seafood and our floral department. Natural foods continued to generate strong double-digit growth in the first quarter. And during the quarter, we saw growth in households and loyal households as well as unit growth.  As noted in our press release this morning, we reported identical supermarket sales without fuel of 1.4%. This result was aligned with our internal expectations for the quarter. When calculating identical sales to be more inclusive of all company business units, including Kroger Specialty Pharmacy and ship-to-home solutions, our ID sales without fuel were 1.9% in the first quarter. We intend to use this calculation going forward as it presents a comprehensive view of our performance as we redefine the grocery customer experience and is therefore a more appropriate measure of our performance. We've also looked at what others include in their ID calculations and have taken this step to be more consistent with how our peers report.  Our space optimization work is right on plan. We have about 30% of our planned 600 stores completed for 2018. Space optimization will continue to be a headwind to ID sales until late third quarter. By then, we will have more stores completed and maturing than in process or not yet started, which is why it will start to be a benefit to sales later in the year.  Retail perform -- retail fuel performance during the quarter was good again. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.187 compared to $0.171 in last year's first quarter. The average retail price of fuel was $2.65 versus $2.28 in the same quarter last year. This includes convenience stores for the period prior to the divestiture.  In April, we completed the sale of our convenience store business unit for $2.15 billion. After tax proceeds, we'll total $1.7 billion. We are returning a significant amount of the capital to shareholders through our $1.2 billion accelerated share repurchase program and we used the balance of the after-tax proceeds to lower our net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio compared to the end of fiscal 2017.  Kroger's net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio increased to 2.43 on a 52-week basis. Our net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio target range is 2.3 to 2.5x. We expect our net total debt-to-EBITDA -- our net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio to increase throughout the year due to increased borrowings to fund our investment in Ocado, our planned merger with Home Chef and tax payments related to the gain from the sale of our convenience store business unit.  Our financial strategy is to use our free cash flow to drive growth while also maintaining our current investment grade debt rating and returning capital to shareholders. We continually balance the use of cash flow to achieve these goals.  Over the last 4 quarters, we used cash to contribute an incremental $1.2 billion pretax to company-sponsored pension plans and $467 million pretax to satisfy withdrawal obligations to the Central States Pension Fund; repurchased 110 million common shares for $2.7 billion, which includes $1.1 billion repurchased through the accelerated stock repurchase plan; paid $442 million in dividends and invest $3 billion in capital. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $546 million remaining under the March share repurchase authorization. Purchases under the ASR will be completed no later than July 6.  We are investing an incremental $500 million in our associates in wages, training and development over the next 3 years through Restock Kroger. This will be in addition to our continued efforts to rebalance pay and benefits while also focusing on certifications and performance incentives, career opportunities and training.  We have several major negotiations in 2018, including contracts with the UFCW for store associates at Smith's in Albuquerque, Fred Meyer in Portland and Kroger stores in Richmond and Fort Wayne. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and a compensation package to provides solid wages, good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We continue to strive to make our overall benefit package relevant to today's associates.  Our financial results continue to be pressured by inefficient health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions, which represent many of our associates, the importance of growing our business and profitably, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.  Turning now to guidance for 2018. We expect identical sales growth, excluding fuel, to range from 2% to 2.5% in 2018. This reflects our updated definition of identical sales and is supported by an expectation for identical supermarket sales that is the same as our original guidance for the year. To be clear, if we hadn't updated the ID sales definition, we would have confirmed our original guidance for the year this morning.  We have raised the low end of our net earnings guidance range to $3.64 to $3.79 per diluted share for 2018. The previous GAAP range was $3.59 to $3.79. On an adjusted basis, we raised the low end of our net earnings guidance range to $2 to $2.15 per diluted share compared to $1.95 to $2.15 previously.  We feel very good about the year. We planned for the first quarter to be our strongest EPS quarter, which creates a tailwind for the investments we plan the rest of the year. Our first quarter was a $0.10 outperformance over the consensus forecast. And as I said earlier, it was also a little better than our internal expectations. Looking at the consensus forecast through the remainder of the year, we believe the second and fourth quarters are a little high compared to our own expectations and the third quarter looks reasonable. I've taken the unusual step of commenting on this because if you simply add the $0.10 to your forecasts for the year, that would put the consensus above the high side of our guidance range.  We're off to a great start to 2018 and are on pace to deliver our $2 to $2.15 net earnings per diluted share guidance range for the year. We continue to expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions, and the purchases of leased facilities, to be approximately $3 billion for 2018. And finally, we expect our 2018 tax rate to be approximately 22%. And now, I'll turn it back to Rodney. W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike.  When we announced Restock Kroger, we talked about retailers needing to constantly reinvent themselves. It takes time to do this. We're now past the halfway point and everything we are doing today is transforming our business for renewed growth.  For 2018, we are a little ahead of where we thought we'd be. We're hitting our cost control targets due to process change, improving the associate experience and innovating to create the future of retail. That innovation is both internal and external. We are joining up with external partners like Ocado and Home Chef to create customer value while quickly expanding our seamless coverage area. We remain confident in our ability to deliver both on our plan for the year and to execute Restock Kroger over the next 3 years, which will create shareholder value.  Now, we look forward to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Michael Lasser of UBS. Michael Lasser : I have 2 questions. One, why is buy versus build the right decision for some of the recent actions you've taken? Particularly in the home delivery market, that is increasingly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry. And then, I have a second question on the guidance. J. Schlotman: I'm not sure what you mean by buy versus build on the home delivery. We really haven't -- obviously, with Home Chef and the meal kits, we did anticipate merging with them. And they have a great process and a great home delivery business of those meal kits, but as Rodney said, they're also going to take over managing the in-store portion of that business as well. So they'll get insight not just to home delivery, but also delivering the meals to those customers in the brick-and-mortar environment as well.  Another aspects of home delivery. We're actually creating partnerships, whether it's with Instacart as we do today in areas or as we further our relationship with Ocado and start building the sheds here in the U.S. and have that be an avenue for home delivery as well. We think some of these partnerships and the phenomenal technology and proprietary information and processes that Ocado has will accelerate our ability to do those in the U.S. W. McMullen: Yes. Just one additional thing to Mike's comment. I mean, we're really looking at what's a blend of both and which one accelerates for us to be able to get it complete as fast as possible in an efficient way and making sure that we maintain and grow on the relationship with the customers. So it's really looking at partnerships and some things we continue to build on our own. If you look at our own ClickList business, we're growing on our own. So it's really a blend of both. Michael Lasser : That's helpful. My follow-up question is on the guidance. Can you give us a little bit more insight into some of the moving pieces? Are you -- have you changed what's embedded for operating profit dollars for this year? Particularly after it sounded like you're seeing more success with some of the process improvement and process changes that are resulting in SG&A dollars savings, even there's -- it's hard for us to tell given what's been provided. J. Schlotman: Yes. I don't -- I would say we haven't changed our view of where operating profit dollars would trend for the year. It would be a consistent view that we would expect, overall, for 2018 to be a bit of an investment year. Obviously, our share count is a lot lower, which will help your earnings per share calculation. We are off to a great start for the year. I think we purposely, if you look at how we've set this year up, we purposely made sure we had some of the savings in the bank from the process changes. We began to pull-forward investments in the business in the last several weeks of the quarter. So you didn't see a lot of the effect [Audio Gap] from the investments we're going to make in price and other service elements in the store until very late in the quarter. Those will start to happen in the second quarter and throughout the rest of the year as well. Operator : The next question will come from Edward Kelly of Wells Fargo. Edward Kelly : I wanted to first just ask about the comps and the outlook. Could you talk about the cadence of the IDs throughout the quarter and what you're seeing so far in Q2? And just as we think about the full year, obviously you maintained your ID guidance. It does look like there's going to be less inflation probably than what maybe we would have thought about a quarter ago. So I guess it suggests that your outlook on tonnage is probably a bit better than what it's been. And clearly, just to get that number, right, you need an improvement from here. So just your thoughts on all that would be helpful. J. Schlotman: Sure, Ed. If you look at IDs, obviously, we're just barely below the guidance range. Either the old definition or the new definition, we're only 10 basis points short of being inside our guidance range for the year. So it's not a huge hill to climb to be inside that guidance range for the year.  There are a lot of moving parts to ID sales out there. I would agree with you on inflation. There certainly isn't as much inflation. There's mid -- between 1% and 2% inflation in pharmacy. The rest of the business would probably be 0.5% to a little less than 0.5%. And in some categories, it's actually deflationary, but it's a little bit all over the board.  When you think about -- as we continue to execute our space optimization strategy, that certainly creates a headwind today. We think that headwind will continue to mitigate throughout the second quarter, a little bit -- it will lessen, it will continue to be a headwind. And by the time we get to late third quarter, we would expect that to turn to be a tailwind, which we think will help offset some of the headwind we create on our own on the retail cost deflation by the investments and prices we're making.  I would say our expectations for ID sales this year were not really predicated on an inflation-driven result. It was based on a unit-driven result. Just when you think about the fact we knew we were going to be creating headwinds early in the year with space optimization and now that we've done the first slug of the pull-forward investments we planned to make at the end of this quarter, that will create some -- a bit of a headwind in the near-term as well.  And answering your question about where we are so far in the quarter, I think our expectations from the quarter would be that we would expect to be somewhere in the neighborhood of where we were in this year's -- in the first quarter. We would expect the second quarter to be comparable to that. We're slightly below it, but keep in mind, we're probably at the peak of the headwind for space optimization today and we're right in the biggest portion of having made all of the pull-forward price investments we made in the last 4 weeks of the quarter. All of those are converging right now.  And we continue to be very happy with the unit growth we see and the response from our customers of what we see in reacting to the price investments, a lot of those in Our Brands. And you heard Rodney talk about Our Brands unit growth in the first quarter of over 5%, which is -- it's not only phenomenal product, it's a phenomenal result and even more value for our customers. Edward Kelly : Okay. And just another question for you is on labor and labor negotiations and structuring of contracts. Obviously, it does seem like you're approaching negotiations a little bit differently and trying to structure contracts that provide you with more flexibility within the store, particularly around sort of like who can do what, right? Can you just give a little bit more color on what you're looking to accomplish there? And then as we think about the structure of those changes, how does that play into your ability to drive labor cost savings in the stores going forward? W. McMullen: If you look at overall, in terms of the approach, it's really contemporizing the way our associates are paid and understanding we have 5 generations in the workforce and having a pay design that connects with each one of those 5 generations. So a big part of every negotiation is understanding the balance between health care and pension. We still have, as Mike mentioned, one of the most generous health care and pension benefits in the industry. Some of our younger associates, that's not as important, and making sure that we balance plan designs with wages. As you know, we've increased starting wages and a lot of the acceleration that's part of Restock Kroger was acceleration of starting wages. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are seeing improvements in retention.  The -- in terms of the ability -- you're always working on process changes to improve how the workflows and use direct -- reduce labor so that our -- we can reinvest that labor in better service. So if you think about today, we're investing labor in ClickList, we're investing labor in some of the service departments, and what we're able to do is as our business continues to grow, it also creates more demand on people.  I don't know, Mike, anything you'd want to add to that? J. Schlotman: No, I absolutely agree. And one of the exciting things we're seeing is we're starting to see the green shoots of the investments in the opening wage rates for our associates and our ability to retain that associate for a longer period of time. If we can keep that associate for a full year, we're actually on the positive side of the investment because we haven't invested -- we haven't had to hire and train and get a new associate up to speed. And that cost is actually more than the dollar an hour wage investment for 2,000 in [ ADRs ] worked in a year. So it winds up being very positive for our associates. They can -- they get more pay. And it winds up being positive for our customers because you have a more experienced and recognizable workforce as well. W. McMullen: Yes. You hear us talk about -- a lot about opportunity culture. And what we find is when people love people and love working with people and they love food, we're a beautiful place to come. And people come here for a job, but as they spend time around people and the [ fastest going ] and the ability to understand how they impact peoples' lives every single day, they fall in love with it, and that's when it becomes a career. And the nice thing about us is as -- many of the people -- over 70% of our store managers started out as hourly associates. So it's a great place to come for a job and then make it a career. Edward Kelly : I do think -- what I was trying to get at, I think part of the reason that your cost structure is higher, right, it's because there are different work rules in the stores relative to some of your nonunionized peers. And are those things that you're able to address through restructuring of labor contracts? I think, more recently, maybe you had done that in one of the contracts that you had talked about. J. Schlotman: It's certainly a component in every negotiation we have of getting wall-to-wall clerk status in those contracts. So whatever task needs to be completed next, we can manage a workforce that can do all the tasks inside of a store rather than need to have 3 or 4 different employees all ready to do the next task in each individual department. That was clearly a component of the Cincinnati negotiation that we completed most recently. And it's not like flipping a switch for Cincinnati where they immediately understand how to manage a work schedule with a clerk like that after many years of not having that type of a clerk. So those savings continue to grow in the Cincinnati market, but we strive to get that more and more added. It's an important component of, one, we have to hire. We have to have fewer people because I can have one person work 15 or 16 hours a week instead of 4 people working a few hours in every department. [indiscernible] of hours worked. Operator : The next question comes from Karen Short of Barclays. Karen Short : So I just want to make sure I am understanding this. So Mike, based on your comments on consensus EPS for 2Q, 3Q and 4Q, it implies operating profit swings from being slightly up in 1Q to kind of being down somewhere in the 20% range 2Q to 4Q. Is that -- first of all, that's fair, right? J. Schlotman: Well, I don't have that exact math right in front of me. We've been very outspoken about the fact that we expect operating profit dollars to be -- FIFO operating profit dollars to be down this year as compared to last year. That would continue to be our expectation. And as I said earlier in the prepared comments, we continue to make the investments in the business and they became later in the year as well. Karen Short : Okay. And the reason that the swing is so extreme from 1Q into 2Q is, as you said, the remodels ramp and price investments ramp pretty meaningfully? J. Schlotman: Well, we made a lot of the pull-forward price investments we made in the last 4 weeks of the quarter. We wanted to make sure we had that tailwind and knew that we were going to get the cost savings before we made the investments and just hoped about it.  One other thing I would remind you about the year-on-year comparison is, last year had 53 weeks and this year has 52 weeks. So you have to adjust for that as well. Karen Short : Okay. And so just switching gears, I'm just wondering if you could maybe give us an update on how many units you've actually -- or maybe you will have completed on the Restock program by the end of maybe 2Q? And then, if there's any early indication you could give us on how you think comps of those stores are performing and maybe separate out how comps in stores that didn't have optimization are performing versus the ones that did? J. Schlotman: Well, I guess, I can give you comp by store, too. As I said in my prepared remarks, we're about 30% of the way through the 600. So that would mean we've got about 200 or so of the stores completed. That doesn't mean that they've gone through the maturation process that it takes a few weeks after the completion for the customer to come back in the store, get familiar with the new layout of the store, make sure -- there are instances where our customer is looking for something. In the near term, kind of throws up the white flag until they can figure out exactly where everything is located in the new layout.  Now, we staff up and have maps and things like that, but that takes a while. As I said earlier, we expect over the course of the next couple of periods that the peak amount of the headwind from the space optimization will be occurring. And by the time we get late in the third quarter, we will clearly have more stores completed going through -- and on the upside of the maturation process than stores we have left to start or that are still in process.  Well, it's a little early at this point in time to talk about the stores and the lift we're having. We actually had that conversation yesterday in our meetings and we would think -- we think that's probably something we'll address in the second quarter. What I would tell you is what we're seeing so far is exactly -- it's exactly the pattern that we would expected and that we saw on the 20 or so stores we did early in this process to determine it was something worth doing on a broader basis. So we haven't seen any surprises whatsoever. Karen Short : Okay. And then, just the last question. Has there been any contemplation that maybe you could accelerate opening the Ocado facilities? I mean, I know you've given us the time line and you're still evaluating the markets, but it would seem that maybe an acceleration would be something that would be viewed favorably. W. McMullen: Well, we're going to open the facilities as fast as we can. Obviously, there's a certain amount of time it takes to construct a facility and then for Ocado to build it out. So there's plenty of pressure on Ocado and us to get them open as quick as we can, but there is obviously a certain amount of time in terms of what it takes to actually get the work done. J. Schlotman: I just want to point out one thing on your question on operating profit. I would encourage you to look at the tables attached to the press release to understand the adjustment items that are in there because I think when you pull out the C stores, when you pull out -- we had a mark-to-market gain on the Ocado shares we owned before the announcement of the merger. That was like $36 million, which is on Table 6 of the earnings release.  I think when you look at operating profit margin dollars apples-to-apples, the dollars were actually down slightly in the quarter as compared to last year, not up, which is exactly the trend we expect. But again, it goes -- it's all about balance and trying to keep things within the range we have. There are -- there were several things that happened in the first quarter that were income that we took out of adjustment items when you look at -- I think it's Table 6 in the press release that's... Karen Short : Yes, it's 5. Yes. J. Schlotman: That will be an important table for everybody to look at. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Kenneth Goldman : I just wanted to first clarify what is outside ID sales now? Is it just new stores, remodels and jewelry? Or am I missing something? J. Schlotman: Net new stores would not be in. Relocations would not be in. Well, the stores don't go in until they're open in their current state for 5 full quarters. So if we expand, relocate or open a new store, it's the fifth quarter where they go in.  There are other parts of our business that generate revenue, things like 84.51\u00b0 and our data sales and those kinds of items, that we don't include in ID sales. What is in ID sales are things we sell directly to a customer, whether it's through a brick-and-mortar store or an online business. That is what's in ID sales today going forward. Kenneth Goldman : And then -- sorry, go ahead, please. W. McMullen: Yes. Some of our competitors would include expansions, but we do not include expansions in our calculation. We didn't before and we still don't. Sorry, Ken. Kenneth Goldman : No, that's okay. I'll follow-up afterward on some specifics, but that's helpful. I also wanted to ask a little bit about Rodney's comment about, over time, reaching all of America. And given that the Northeast has such a dense population and given that you don't really have a presence there, is that sort of a hint, Rodney, about how you view the potential of Ocado going forward? I just wanted to kind of get a sense of what that comment meant. Or maybe I misheard it and I just wanted some clarification there, if I could. W. McMullen: Yes. You did not mishear it. And that is our vision and our aspiration. And obviously, that will be one piece of the puzzle on serving that. Home Chef will also be one piece of serving it. And we -- our customers tell us we do a great job of helping them solve every day needs in a great way. And any way that we can expand the number of people that can get access to that, that's good for our customers. It's good for our associates. And when we do things good for those, our shareholders benefit. So you did not misinterpret my comment. Kenneth Goldman : One last one, if I could just sneak one in, is on your Corporate Brands, your own brands. Do you think -- you talked them up a little bit more than usual I think, at least the tone seemed to be that way to me. How much of that was due to some of the changes you've made in Restock Kroger in terms of prioritizing private label in certain categories, putting them at the top right in the middle of the shelf? So I just wanted to get an idea of whether there's a correlation there in your mind. W. McMullen: Yes. The -- I'm going to give you a little bit more answer, Ken, than you probably even want. But one of the things last year that our team did was a very elaborate analysis of Our Brands versus our competitors, their own brands, and we also did taste comparisons and quality comparisons versus national brands. And one of the things that we had underappreciated was the quality of our product scored incredibly well with our customers and potential customers. So one of the things that Mike and Robert and their teams and Gil, their teams decided to do was based on that insight is to be much more aggressive about telling our customers the quality of what we have and what we have to offer. So really, that's what caused us to make our own brands such a key and integral part of Restock Kroger. It's that commitment and drive that our customers are supporting us. And it's showing in the results. Operator : And our next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : So I know it's early, but 2 questions on Ocado. It obviously can do a lot of things for you. But when you think about the ability to do ClickList in a more labor-efficient manner, maybe be less disruptive to the stores, so how important is that, right, on the pecking order? And then if it is important, just the transition, how would you transition that? And then secondly, when you do Ocado in a market where you don't have brick-and-mortar, is it important -- could you -- would you want to have some brick-and-mortar? And does that open the door to partnering with other retailers or is that just too difficult to do? W. McMullen: Yes. I love your questions and I agree with your comment that it's early in the process. What we're really trying to do is to make sure that we have an overall infrastructure for digital that can support whether it's 5% of share or 30% of share. If it ends up being 30% of share in grocery as digital, then the Ocado, you'll have more sheds and they'll be used to take pressure off of a store and a store will become more of a distribution point. So what we're really trying to design is a flexibility of a system that can scale based on how the customer changes. We would expect that Ocado would be something that we will pick orders out of for stores if the orders in a store comes to a high enough percentage that it affects the customer's experience. John Heinbockel : You don't -- today, there's no -- because the volume is so modest, there's no evidence that doing ClickList adversely impacts the in-store experience, correct? W. McMullen: Yes. So far, it doesn't, but the thing that we don't know, if you look at our sales growth on ClickList or our digital overall, it was in the high 60s and in -- and some of that growth is in -- is driven by identicals. And we're starting to get a pretty good base of identical stores that are on ClickList. If it continues to grow at its pace, we certainly could see, when you go out a couple of years, where it could and we want to be proactive on being positioned to deal with it versus reactive to dealing with it. John Heinbockel : All right. Fair. And then just lastly, the price investments you are making this year, right, compared to prior rounds, what does the elasticity look like, right? So I imagine there is kind of a -- we're getting -- you get the high-volume items first. We're getting to a longer tail. Is the elasticity less significant than prior rounds? W. McMullen: I guess, I would -- elasticity is consistent with what we expected it would be. There are certain categories where there's very little elasticity. There's others that would have elasticity. So so far, the investments have been consistent with what we would have expected. And you're always balancing a mix between those different items. Operator : And the next question comes from William Kirk of RBC Capital Markets. William Kirk : So we've seen some high-profile closures at some of your competitors. I guess, the first part of that is have you seen a material benefit from any of those closures? And second, do you expect more closures to come? And in particular, I'm thinking of the California market. Is there any pending closures that you'd expect in that marketplace? J. Schlotman: Well, you can certainly never predict when a competitor is going to wind up closing. And if you look around some of our markets where there had been closures, we've been the beneficiary in a few ways : One, from picking up the business; two, from picking up some of their closed store sites like we did in Indianapolis when Marsh closed and as Farm Fresh has exited the Hampton Roads area. We picked up some of those stores and some other folks have as well. You continue to see those kinds of things happening as well.  Southeastern Grocers, as they emerge from bankruptcy, we're not obviously very affected by the stores in Florida they closed, but as they repositioned their portfolio of BI-LO stores, there's certainly a number of those that would have gone up against either a Kroger store or a Harris Teeter store. So those wind up being beneficial. We didn't really pick up much of anything from there. There was only one or 2 stores that had any interest. And I, frankly, don't even know if they came to fruition as I sit here right now.  But anytime a store closes in a market, it winds up helping. Sometimes our folks say, well, they're only doing x volume in the business. And I say, well, if you get half of that and divide it by the sales of the nearest store, you're talking 3% or 4% IDs for that store. So it can be kind of beneficial when those come in on top because those incremental sales are very valuable. W. McMullen: And broader, over time -- this isn't specific to any market -- we would expect continued consolidation in our industry. And that's been a trend that's happened for the last -- for 20, 30 years.  And I'm trying to remember, Mike may have mentioned it this morning on one of the interviews. If you look at competitors in terms of who has market share, almost 30% of the market share is still held by people without our economies of scale. William Kirk : Okay. That's useful. And then separately, on the convenience stores, now that, that transaction's closed, are there any other assets that would be worth considering divestiture or is that the streamlining that needs to be done at this time? J. Schlotman: Well, I wouldn't -- we're constantly looking at our portfolio. We constantly look at closing underperforming stores and reallocating capital. I wouldn't say that we're -- specifically want to sell anything or buy anything, but we're cognizant of what might be more valuable to someone else versus us. That's really what happened with the convenience store business. It's a business we had invested a lot of capital in and multiples of EBITDA for the sales of those are pretty much at all-time highs. And it was a prudent time to have that asset and found a great partner in EG who wound up taking all of our associates. And it's a process we go through with our board on a regular basis. So they understand which assets that we have are generating a good return on invested capital and which aren't. Operator : And the next question comes from Judah Frommer of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Judah Frommer : So first, maybe just on the competitive and pricing environment, and this is somewhat tied to inflation. But if we listen to commentary out of what I would call some smaller players, it sounds like they are seeing some passing on of whatever little inflation there is to shelf pricing, but that seems less and less important for players like yourselves or larger competitors that are more focused on targeted promotions. So what are you seeing out there? And how important is it to continue to invest in pricing environment where maybe some other players are pulling back there? J. Schlotman: Well, in our mind, as you know, a big portion and the fundamental piece of Restock Kroger is to continue to invest in our business and that takes several forms. It's -- when we say invest in the business, everybody immediately goes to price. Price is an important component of it. We are making investments in price in certain categories. I would say we're not opposed to a retail shelf price going up. And sometimes, we have to be cognizant as the dominant player in many markets. If there's price inflation in a particular item or a particular category, if the big players don't pass on that inflation, it's probably not going to get passed on. So we do make those value judgments day in and day out as we look at the particular categories where the inflation might be. This is a game of what's -- how do we make sure that our offering resonates with the consumers and we try to balance all facets of that. Judah Frommer : Okay. And then, maybe switching gears back to Ocado. If we think about ClickList and home delivery being kind of the key components of online grocery now and what Ocado has been doing in their home market in terms of better profitability on basket given just kind of fewer picking touches and efficiencies like that, how do you think about the potential for your online grocery business's profitability over time as Ocado comes in? W. McMullen: We would certainly view that it's part of the overall equation and improving the profitability over time, but we're -- as you've heard us talk about before, what we're really focused on is when somebody decides to eat something, they can get it from us. And we're increasingly adding delivery service to markets. We're using our data to help inspire people on what a meal that they will enjoy. So it's part of that overall ecosystem as we create the retail of the future. So it's an important component of that, but it's one piece of the total puzzle. Operator : And the next question comes from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : So I wanted to touch on your commentary just about the better cost controls during the quarter. Is there any more color you can provide in terms of what's driving those improvements and the process changes in the benefit on your cost line? J. Schlotman: Well, as I mentioned in the prepared comments, our shrink folks had a great result in the quarter and continue to get a better result on our waste. And they're looking at it -- really, they don't use the word shrink. We use the word shrink because that's what resonates with all of you.  Internally, we talk about waste. And they're trying to understand every facet of waste, whether it's not having the product aligned in the back cooler the right way to get on the sales floor before it goes out of code, making sure the back doors are locked so a product only comes in the back door and not out the back door, making sure that the high theft areas of our store are monitored generally electronically. You can go in stores today and you'll see visible cameras in high theft areas like cosmetics. They probably saw me this weekend when I waved to one of the cameras when I was in my local Kroger store. They're probably wondering -- now, they'll probably going to watch me in every store I go into. But those kinds of techniques are out there to prevent the waste. And when you have those kinds of techniques in there, people are less likely to even try. And when they do try and they get caught, that does spread through that community and they stop trying with you.  But it goes across the broad spectrum of monitors on cooler doors not being shut at a store. And if it's open for x seconds, not only does it waste energy, it lets hot air in and the product quality can be diminished. Well, with our temperature monitoring process that we actually originally put in as a labor savings initiative in the store so we didn't have to go about the store and -- I'm starting to talk like the Brits and go about the store. I've spent a lot of time with Ocado -- but go about the store and take temperatures. What you really find is it winds up being quite a bit of a waste reduction benefit in keeping the cold chain secure.  I'd like to say it used to be you didn't know an ice cream freezer was losing temperature until you saw the ice cream melt. Now, we get an alert that, that motor in that ice cream case is being inefficient. You can get the product out, get the motor fixed and probably get it fixed with a repair instead of a replacement like what we used to have to do in the past.  So there's a whole lot of things like that. I highlight waste today because they're working really hard and having really great results. And I want to have a little bit of a shout out to that team and thank you for all the hard work they've done. It's starting to show. It's in the results. Operator : And that final question will come from Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley. Vincent Sinisi : So wanted to go back. Obviously, it's still early, but digital clearly increasing in focus. Just wondering, with maybe some of the 84.51\u00b0 data that you guys have and some of the areas where it's a bit longer, can you give us any kind of further color on what you are seeing from a customer perspective? So meaning in the stores where some form of it had been available for a while, kind of how is the progression changing? What's in the basket, ticket frequency to the store? And then maybe also just as you're looking at these first 3 Ocado facilities, anything at this point that you can provide in terms of thoughts around how much of the geographies or stores that, that may encompass? W. McMullen: Well, if you look at digital, the -- I think the key point -- and this is the part that hasn't surprised us at all. When a customer engages with us digitally, we get a higher share of their total household spend. And what we find is the customer still comes into the store, but they come into it based on when they want to or -- an example I always think of is if you've got a couple of kids at home and they bring their friends over, you probably didn't buy food for their friends and somebody will stop by or get a delivery to their house really quick. So what we find is the more digitally engaged somebody is, the higher their total household spend is. It's not necessarily consistent from week-to-week in terms of your share of how much of it's digital and how much of it's physical in the store. The thing that's absolutely critical is to do it in a seamless way and do it seamlessly from food inspiration or help you eat healthier.  We just launched an app called OptUP and we're able to -- if a customer opts in, we can help a customer eat better on a sugar basis. Over time, we'll have more functionality, but today, it's more minimizing and managing your sugar intake. But all of those things is how do we make your life easier and how do you live your life -- how do we help support you living your life the way you want to? So everything that we're doing, what we're trying to do is to make sure it's seamless across all our channels. So that's really the piece that we're working hard on.  On your second question on Ocado, that's one of the things that the Ocado team is actually working with us and modeling is to understand how far can a shed reach in a market. And as you know with Ocado, they also have local depots as well that will be part of a shed network. And right now, they are actually modeling -- answering your question -- your question's a great one, but we are in the middle of modeling that. And so at some point, we'll be able to answer with more specifics, but at this point, we're still working on that. Vincent Sinisi : Okay. And if I could just fit one more fast one in here if you don't mind because we get asked about this all the time. I think it's been now 2 quarters since you had mentioned within -- kind of some of the gross margin benefit about vendor negotiations. Any updates there? Like, how are some of those conversations going? And maybe just even as we go through the year, I think 3Q, just from a compare, is kind of the most difficult. So any updates there that you can share or just basic thoughts, that would be great. J. Schlotman: So our team that negotiates the cost of goods with our vendors continue to have great success using a variety of techniques depending on the category. And keep in mind, everything we do on our negotiation process begins with the customer in the forefront and understanding by category what items are important to the customer, what items might be less important to the customer. And that begins the whole -- the entire negotiation process and, oftentimes, playing one vendor off of another when the customer might be indifferent to it.  I would say it's right on track with our expectation. It is a big component of our expected savings over the next 3 years. And I'm thrilled with what that entire team has done. And we've brought some new talent into that group. And we're really thrilled with how that group has hit the ground running on not only cost of goods, saving of goods for sale, but also goods not for resale, so supplies and the like and other items that we consume ourselves in doing business every day. W. McMullen: We are incredibly confident about the future of Kroger, especially with Restock Kroger. One of the exciting things about our earnings call is that many of our associates listen in to better understand and gain insights into our business. And of course, many of our associates are shareholders as well.  So before we end today's call, I'd like to share a few final comments directed toward them. We are very proud of Kroger's opportunity culture where you can come for a job and stay for a career. And as you know, we took 1/3 of our tax savings to invest in new and enhanced benefits for our associates. We used part of that investment to establish our best-in-class educational offering, Feed Your Future. I'm thrilled to see so many of you already taking advantage of these new benefits.  Let me tell you a story about one of the first associates to take advantage of Feed Your Future. Lindsay is a pharmacy technician in our Louisville division. She was working her way through college, accumulating student loans and had planned to stop working to focus on school full-time. But after an assistant store manager told her about Feed Your Future, Lindsay decided to stay with Kroger while she finishes her bachelor's degree. And now, Lindsay's goal is to pursue a graduate degree with dreams of becoming a physician's assistant for our Little Clinic business.  Lindsay's story is exactly what we hoped would happen when we introduced Feed Your Future. We believe that when we support our associates and each other and our customers, business and shareholders will benefit. Thank you for all you do for each other and everybody every day. That completes our call for today. Thanks for joining. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Rebekah Manis, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Rebekah Manis : Thank you, Gary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on the business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our second quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Please save the date for our 2018 Investor Conference, which we will hold in Cincinnati on October 29 and 30. Details will be coming soon, and we hope you can join us. I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. W. McMullen: Thank you, Rebekah. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me to review Kroger's second quarter 2018 results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman. Restock Kroger is designed to reposition our core business by 2020 so we can achieve our long-term vision to serve America through food inspiration and uplift. We outlined the 4 main drivers of our plan last October : first, redefine the grocery customer experience; second, partner for customer value; third, develop talent; and fourth, live our purpose. Delivering on our objectives under each of these areas between now and 2020 will generate incremental operating margin dollars and free cash flow to create shareholder value. And while we are only 2 quarters into our 3-year plan, we are making solid progress. More importantly, I want to help you understand how all the steps we take today and in the future are set in motion with clear strategic intent in line with our vision. Everything we are doing is intended to create a truly seamless shopping experience so we can serve customers Anything, Anytime and Anywhere. As we create a seamless experience, we'll use our data to provide convenient and personalized food inspiration to help customers to be the hero to their families at mealtime every time. You can see this through our exclusive arrangement to bring Ocado's smart platform to the U.S.; and in our recent launch of Ship, Kroger's new direct-to-customer shipping platform; and in our continued expansion of home delivery, including our driverless delivery tests with Nuro. You can also see this in our merger with Home Chef. Part of what makes our merger so exciting is their data-driven and customer-centered approach to menu creation and meal solution development. Home Chef is accelerating our ability to deliver convenience, simplicity and a personalized food experience. We are also building an expansive network of innovative partnerships to create new customer value. Alternative revenue streams will expand and enhance our strong core business and increase profitability. Partnering with innovators like Ocado will both accelerate our core business and serve as the foundational platforms for new opportunities. Our decision to launch our brands in the international markets through Alibaba's Tmall global platform is another example of our willingness to develop alternative revenue streams. And our people, generosity and passion for Zero Hunger | Zero Waste will make the world a better place. We are incredibly excited to see that our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste commitment earned Kroger a place among the top 10 companies on Fortune magazine's Change the World list. You can see our vision coming into focus in several of the exciting announcements we've made over the last couple of months, and we're obviously not done. As we share more of these very intentional puzzle pieces with you in the months and years ahead, a very clear picture will emerge. Every one of these announcements is both a culmination of a new beginning and they are a culmination of the long focused strategic work by our teams, and they are the new beginning of the exciting innovations and growth platforms for the future. Kroger's digital sales grew by over 50% in the second quarter. We're executing our digital strategy and growing our seamless coverage area, which now reaches more than 80% of our customers, up from 75% in the first quarter. This includes our network of ClickList pickup locations; stores offering home delivery through Instacart and other partners; and ship-to-home capabilities, such as our new Kroger Ship platform. Kroger Ship launched in 4 markets in August : Cincinnati, Houston, Louisville and Nashville. We have since launched in Atlanta and anticipate rolling out the service to additional markets over the next few months. During this first phase of Ship, customers can shop from a curated selection of over 4,500 Our Brand products, which are not available anywhere else online, and more than 50,000 grocery and household essentials that matter most to our customers, a list informed by the 84.51\u00b0 data and insights. Executing our strategy and innovating in our core business requires tremendous digital and technology talent. I'm pleased to share that this summer, Kroger Technology was named one of the Best Places to Work in IT by Computerworld magazine. Also this summer, we announced Kroger is establishing a new digital headquarters in downtown Cincinnati. In the city alone, we expect to grow the digital team from about 600 today to over 1,000 people by 2020. Then in August, we signed an agreement with the University of Cincinnati to operate an innovation lab within the school's new Innovation Hub, creating another talent pipeline to support our business. All the changes we are making to build digital platforms will also create opportunities to grow our business and improve margins in the future. We are aggressively investing in these transformational opportunities. And while we are investing for the future, we are delivering for customers and shareholders today. Our Brands continue to resonate with customers, both in-store and online. Since August launch of Kroger Ship, 41 of the top 50 items sold are Our Brand, and 4 of the top 5 items on ClickList are Our Brands. In the center of the store, premium Our Brands, including Private Selection, HemisFares and Abound, grew double digits during the second quarter as well. In the second quarter, Our Brands made up 28.2% of unit sales and 26.5% of sales dollars, both of which are record results for a second quarter. Our Brands continue to outpace Kroger's identical sales growth, led by more than a 15% growth in our popular Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic lines during the second quarter. Simple Truth has quickly become the second largest brand sold in our stores since launching 5 years ago. In 2018, Simple Truth reached more than $2 billion in annual sales, making it the largest natural and organic brand in America. Simple Truth's popularity and explosive growth is a major reason why we're starting with the brand in our first international pilot with Alibaba's group Tmall global platform. Restock Kroger is just getting started. We like what we're seeing so far and we're working to keep that trend going. The outcome of our key Restock Kroger drivers is the creation of shareholder value, which we remain committed to delivering over the long term. In June, we announced that Kroger's board approved a dividend increase for the 12th consecutive year. Our dividend has grown at a double-digit compound annual growth rate since it was reinstated in 2006. We continue to expect an increasing dividend over time. We are on track to generate the free cash flow and the incremental FIFO operating profit that we committed to in Restock Kroger through 2020 and to deliver on our long-term vision to serve America through food inspiration and uplift. Now here is Mike to share more details on our second quarter results and to update you on our guidance for the remainder of 2018. Mike? J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results demonstrate our ability to deliver for shareholders while we reposition the company for the future through Restock Kroger. As noted in our press release this morning for the first half of 2018, Kroger's adjusted net earnings per diluted share result was slightly ahead of our internal expectations due to the solid early execution of Restock Kroger, including process changes that led to sustainable cost controls and higher-margin alternative revenue streams. This performance will allow us to continue making incremental investments while delivering on our guidance range for the year. We also noted that the second quarter adjustment items relate primarily to the change in the market value of Kroger's investment in Ocado securities. Since our investment and partnership announcement in the second quarter, the share price has doubled. As you know, we accelerated several planned Restock Kroger investments starting in the first quarter and continuing during the second quarter. These include investments in price, especially in support of Our Brands, and in space optimization. Our pricing strategy isn't new. Since 2000, we have invested more than $4.2 billion in lower prices for customers, while also striving to provide the best full-service grocery experience in America. Even as we pursue our long-term strategy, we always look for ways to bank savings before we make significant investments, as we did in the first half of the year. We noted in June that pull-forward investments in Restock Kroger that began in the last 4 weeks of the quarter and continued space optimization rollout will be headwinds to ID sales in the second quarter. So this effect is not a surprise to us. We expect the headwinds from space optimization during the first half of 2018 to come -- become a tailwind late in the third quarter. Looking at our ID sales in the second quarter, 20 of our supermarket divisions had positive IDs, demonstrating Restock Kroger is resonating with customers across the company. Several departments outperformed our total ID sales in the second quarter, most notably natural foods, seafood and pharmacy. We also continue to see growth in households during the quarter. Looking at gross margin, we were pleased to see that our shrink rate continue to improve during the second quarter. The gross margin rate reflects the company's price investments, some rising transportation costs and the growth of the Specialty Pharmacy business. Part of our price investments was to support Our Brands, especially to reduce starting price points. The improvement new movement in the quarter demonstrates these investments are resonating with customers. We intend to continue to invest in price to drive unit growth while also delivering on the bottom line for our shareholders. OG&A costs increased as a rate of sales driven entirely by higher expense for incentive plans as compared to last year. We continue to face rising credit card fees, especially as more customers shift to using credit cards with higher interchange rates. This is a growing problem, and we are taking steps to address it. You likely saw the news this summer that our Foods Co supermarket division announced that it would no longer accept Visa credit cards as a form of payment. This is because Visa rates and fees among the highest of any credit card brand. We stopped accepting Visa credit cards to save on the high costs associated with credit card companies' interchange rates and network fees. The savings will be passed along to Foods Co customers in the form of everyday low prices on items shoppers purchase the most. Foods Co has stopped accepting the cards in mid-August, and we are currently assessing our next steps. We're prepared to expand nonacceptance to other banners if that's what it takes to get a level playing field for negotiated interchange rates. It's also worth noting that we recently changed our Kroger rewards credit card from Visa to MasterCard. We will continue to aggressively manage OG&A costs and implement new programs to reduce our cost of goods. A big focus continues to be on the store productivity and waste. We manage our business every day to drive shareholder value. Our investments in Restock Kroger in redefining the grocery customer experience, partnering for customer value and developing talent will be paid for by cost of goods savings, strong ID sales and productivity gains. This is how we will generate $400 million of incremental FIFO operating profit by the end of 2020. Now for an update on our retail fuel performance during the second quarter. Our second -- our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.263 compared to $0.217 in last year's second quarter. The average retail price of fuel was $2.85 versus $2.28 in the same quarter last year. We expect our 2018 tax rate to be approximately 22%. Excluding the 2018 first and second quarter adjustment items, we expect the 2018 rate to be approximately 20%. Favorable tax resolutions with certain states during the quarter benefited adjusted second quarter net earnings by about $0.01 per diluted share. As previously announced, we're actively exploring strategic alternatives for our Turkey Hill Dairy business, including a potential sale. We want to ensure Turkey Hill has every opportunity to meet its full growth potential. Turkey Hill is a unique CPG food business within Kroger, as it is a strong nationally known brand. Much like our convenience store business, Turkey Hill is such a beloved brand, thanks to the 800 dedicated associates who've contributed to its success. We remain committed to generating the $6.5 billion of free cash flow by 2020 as part of Restock Kroger. The original amount was $6 billion, and we increased it to $6.5 billion after the passage of the federal tax act. We expect the tax act to reduce cash taxes by about $1.2 billion over the next 3 years. We used $700 million of those savings to fund our investment in Ocado and our merger with Home Chef. On one other note -- one other note to this is we have working capital improvements built into the guidance, and we are off to a great start with a $300 million improvement in net operating capital so far this year. Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio on a 52-week basis is 2.59. Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio target range is 2.3 to 2.5. For the remainder of fiscal 2018, we expect our leverage ratio to remain slightly above the target range, primarily due to increased borrowings to fund the company's merger with Home Chef and investments in Ocado. Kroger remains committed to bringing the leverage ratio back into the target range. Our financial strategy is to use our free cash flow to drive growth, while also maintaining our current investment-grade debt rating in returning capital to shareholders. We continually balance the use of cash flow to achieve these goals. Over the last 4 quarters, we have used cash to contribute an incremental $1.1 billion pretax to the company-sponsored pension plans and $467 million pretax to satisfy withdrawal obligations to the Central States Pension Fund. We repurchased 103 million common shares for $2.6 billion, which includes $1.2 billion repurchased with after-tax proceeds from the sale of Kroger's convenience store business unit under a previously announced accelerated stock repurchase plan. We paid $435 million in dividends and invested $2.9 billion in capital. As of the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $546 million remaining under the current share repurchase reauthorization. We're investing an incremental $500 million in our associates in wages, training and development over the next 3 years through Restock Kroger. This will be in addition to our continued efforts to rebalance pay and benefits, while also focusing on certifications and performance incentives, career opportunities and trainings. In March, we also announced investing a portion of our tax savings in our educational assistance program, Feed Your Future, and an increased 401(k) match for our nonunion associates. We recently ratified a contract with the UFCW covering Kroger associates in Fort Wayne, and in the Richmond and Hampton Roads areas. We are currently negotiating with UFCW contracts for stores covering associates at Smith\u2019s in Albuquerque and Fred Meyer in Portland. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We continue to strive to make our overall benefit package relevant for today's associates. Our financial results continue to be pressured by inefficient health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions, which represent many of our associates, on the importance of growing our business and profitably, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. Turning now to guidance for 2018. We continue to expect identical sales growth excluding fuel to range from 2% to 2.5% in 2018. We updated our GAAP net earnings guidance range to $3.88 to $4.03 per diluted share for 2018, from the previous range of $3.64 to $3.79. This increase in guidance is due to the unrealized gain in Ocado shares recorded in the second quarter and does not reflect any ongoing changes in the market value of Ocado shares because those cannot be predicted. On an adjusted basis, our net earnings guidance range remains $2.00 to $2.15 per diluted share for 2018. We continue to expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities to be approximately $3 billion for 2018. And now I'll turn it back to Rodney. W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike. Everything we are doing supports our Restock Kroger vision to serve America through food inspiration and uplift, and we are executing our strategy. We are building a truly seamless shopping experience that we can serve customers Anything, Anytime and Anywhere. We're using our data to provide convenient and personalized food inspiration to help customers be a hero to their families at mealtime every time. We are identifying partners who will help us deliver customer value today and the future. We are laying a foundation for more profitable alternative revenue streams that will also accelerate core business growth. And we are serious about living our purpose to Feed the Human Spirit, because associates, customers and stakeholders are increasingly deciding where to work, where to shop, where to invest and where -- who to support based on a company's commitment to making the world a better place. It's no surprise then that we are very proud that Kroger was recognized in Fortune magazine's 2018 Change the World list for Zero Hunger | Zero Waste, our plan to end hunger in places we call home and eliminate waste across our company by 2025. It is exciting to see our vision taking shape, especially because we know that delivering on our vision will create value for our customers, associates and shareholders. Now we look forward to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Edward Kelly : I wanted to start with the IDs. Can you talk about the cadence of your IDs throughout the quarter, what you're seeing so far in the third quarter? And then part of this, can you quantify the impact that optimization had on the IDs during the quarter? And just generally, how is that playing out so far relative to what you've expected? W. McMullen: I'll start out and I'll let Mike fill in. If you look at the space optimization and the other projects that we mentioned, without those, our identicals would have been a little over 2%. If you look at so far in the third quarter, we're trending a little bit better than where we were in the second quarter. Mike, I'll let you talk about the cadence during the quarter. J. Schlotman: Yes. I think the cadence was actually fairly consistent. There were -- actually, there was a blip or 2 when you look at some things like in Texas last year when we had the disruption down there from Hurricane Harvey, and those kinds of comparisons to the prior year make things a little bit difficult to compare. But when you factor out some of those kinds of items, it was actually fairly consistent. I think the encouraging thing is, is when Rodney talks about where we would have been and why we're very comfortable continuing to give guidance for the year of 2% to 2.5%, what we're seeing on the space optimization stores when they come out of the period of disruption and they get back to business as usual, we're seeing exactly what we expect to see. And obviously, as we get to the back half of the year with the holiday selling season, we won't have stores disrupted and we'll have the stores we're going to realign completed. So we expect to have a great fleet of stores going into the important holiday selling season in the fourth quarter. And 600 of those are redone in a way that is resonating with the customers. Edward Kelly : Great. And just as a follow-up on the guidance. From an EPS standpoint, it does seem like so far this year things have been a bit better than what you've expected. And you've talked about that, I think, Mike, that you raised guidance or you lowered guidance for your tax rate, if you could just clarify that. But either way, this quarter, you didn't touch the guidance at all from an EPS standpoint. Is there something out there that incrementally you're concerned about? Or is this simply a case of conservatism, and as you're comfortable around the guidance, you are really thinking about investing in the business for the next couple of years? J. Schlotman: Yes. When you look at the tax rate, obviously, we had the benefit of the favorable tax resolution from a state standpoint in the first quarter with or without the c-store's effects, the tax rate a bit as well, so it's a little bit confusing. So I know it is a little bit lower, but I would remind you that we lowered the -- we raised the low end of our guidance range in the first quarter. And all those kinds of things would have factored into our decision to do that, including the time once the c-store transaction closed and the like, and where we were on state tax issues, knowing things that we weren't going to say publicly yet, all factored into that decision to raise the lower end. Relative to what we do with overperformance, I think you know this as well as anybody, Ed. And we have a very long history, as I indicated in the prepared comments, we like to deliver some results before we make all the investments that we plan to make. Obviously, this year is a little different in that we had the tax act savings to invest and pull some pricing moves forward, while still being able to deliver on our earnings per share growth. And I think you will see us probably decide how we manage through the rest of the year and where we think the dollars are going to be, continue to make investments to grow the business for the long term. If you look at the midpoint of our guidance range today, that's a little over 6% earnings per share growth rate, which I think is a very respectable result in an environment where we're making dramatic investments to reshape the future of the company. I think the management team here at Kroger is proud of being able to refocus our future efforts and still deliver on the bottom line for shareholders. W. McMullen: In Mike's last point there, I think it's important to remind everybody that we aggressively continue to invest in our digital businesses. And that -- connecting with that customer will increasingly be important in the future, obviously. Because what we find is when a customer engages with us in all channels, they spend more money with us. J. Schlotman: And growing 50% in the digital business doesn't happen without those investments and focus. Operator : The next question comes from Judah Frommer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Judah Frommer : Maybe first just to follow-up on the guidance point. I think there's a little confusion because, like Ed said, the EPS range didn't change, the tax rate came down. So is there some implication that operating income could be lower than you anticipated in the back half of the year? Or is the range just wide enough that there's a range of outcomes considered in the guidance? J. Schlotman: I think it's your latter point. We've guided all along when we gave original guidance, and even back last October when we discussed Restock Kroger with everybody, that we expected 2018 to be a year of investment, and that we would expect operating profit margin to be down. We also talked about the fact, in March, that once the tax act got passed, we were going to take some of those savings. About 1/3 of them would fall to the bottom line, which you've seen through the lower tax rate over time. About 1/3 of it would be invested back in the business, meaning some price investments that we pulled forward into this year out of future years. So these are planned investments that we did early, which means that was a conscious decision to lower operating profit a little more than our original plan this year. I think we're as clear as we could be about that in March as compared to where we would have been in October. And then the third leg of that stool is the investment in people that we talked about with the Feed Your Future, where part-time and full-time associates, if you've worked with us for at least 6 months, can get $3,500 a year to continue their education or get a GED or get a specific trade certification as well as the increased 401(k) match for our associates. I think when you balance all of that, the fact that we're going through -- everything we're going through, making the investments, the space optimization work, incremental benefits for a lot of our associates -- and that $3,500 is all associates, that's store associates and office associates alike. I think I'm very happy with how we're managing through this significant year of change and still, at the midpoint, delivering what would be an -- expected to be a 6% earnings per share growth rate or so at the midpoint of our current estimate. Judah Frommer : Okay. Got it. And just a follow-up. Maybe on the gross margin, the investment, a little bit bigger ex fuel than we anticipated. But can you break down for us a little bit investment in price relative to the freight pressure? And how much of the price investment is related to competition that you're seeing from other channels versus an internal plan? And was there anything above and beyond what you anticipated investing because it was such a strong fuel quarter? J. Schlotman: I think we were right on track with what we expect to invest in price and the pull-forward investments we wound up making. One of the comments we made in both the press release and in the prepared remarks was the growth of our Kroger Specialty Pharmacy business. Their growth has been quite impressive and their ability to gain new relationships in that world has been quite impressive. That is a very high sales model, a very low gross margin compared to the overall Kroger gross margin. So that mix as it grows -- pulls our gross margin down, but it drives very nice growth in gross margin dollars in that business because of what those pharmaceuticals wind up costing. So when you mix all of that out, I don't think we did anything out of the ordinary from our price investments. It's just what the -- it's just what's out there. And I would be remiss in talking about gross profit if I didn't give a shout-out to our cost and waste team. And a very continued -- I think it's 4 quarters in a row now where we've had improvements in our shrink rate. And with our sales, when you have some very nice improvements in the shrink rate, that's one of the cost savings we expect to help fuel Restock Kroger. And they're delivering on what our expectations are, so we have that fuel for the engine. Operator : The next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Erica Eiler : This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. So I wanted to touch on guidance here as well. I was hoping maybe you could talk about what gives you continued confidence on delivering on the 2% to 2.5% ID sales growth, given that it implies a meaningful acceleration even with more difficult comparison. You talked a little bit about Kroger Restock and the benefits you're expecting to see there in the back half, but is there anything else that we should be thinking about that's going to drive that acceleration here? J. Schlotman: I think when we looked at it and decided to keep the 2% to 2.5%, it's something that we certainly think is achievable. And I said on -- when I was on Bloomberg and CNBC this morning, we're laser-focused on delivering on those results. And when you think about Rodney's comment that without the headwind of price investments that we made late in the first quarter that really affected the second quarter pretty dramatically as well as space optimization, without the effect of those headwinds in the second quarter, we would have been over 2%. And as the price investments are in for a longer period of time, the effect as a headwind diminishes because the units start to pick up, like I spoke of in the prepared comments, with the pickup in units in Our Brands where we've made some price investments. And the -- we're more than halfway through our space optimization work. About 55% of the stores that we would expect to be completed are behind us. So as those stores start to mature and come out of the cycle disruption, they will feed the ID sales as we get later this quarter and into the fourth quarter. So it's the combination of those that we expect to come together and be able to deliver in the 2% to 2.5% range. Erica Eiler : Okay. Great, that's helpful. And then just -- I was hoping maybe you could talk a little bit about inflation/deflation here, what you saw during the quarter, your latest outlook. And are you starting to see price increases come through from your vendors? And are you starting to see shelf prices move up? Any additional color here would be helpful as well. W. McMullen: I'll let Mike fill in some of the details. But if you look at overall, really, it was basically 0 on inflation/deflation. You have some of the fresh departments that had a little bit of deflation, but there wasn't anything substantial. So looking forward, we really don't see much change. I would say at this point, we've -- obviously, there's been several announced increases, but we've seen very limited number of increases so far. And the customers certainly wouldn't be experiencing any increase, either, in terms of the prices they're paying. And in fact, it's a little bit less than a year ago. So Mike, I'll let you fill in some of the details. J. Schlotman: No, I would agree with you on it's flat overall and there is pluses and minuses in all the different categories. And our LIFO estimate for the year would be substantially, if not entirely, driven by where pharmacy inflation is and the amount of pharmacy business and inventory we have to support that business. Operator : The next question comes from Karen Short with Barclays. Karen Short : Sorry, just to -- just on that last question, just to clarify. On cost inflation versus retail inflation, you're saying both are basically flat? Or could you just clarify that? J. Schlotman: We were referring to -- at least I was referring to, and I believe Rodney was referring to, cost inflation is what we were talking about. We're not going to get into retail inflation because it's pretty difficult to calculate. As we continue to make price investments as well as the investments we make in Our Brands and the growth of Our Brands, it can look like retail deflation. But a lot of times, it's just growth in a lower price point item, but a higher margin item on the shelf causing that. So we stay focused on where costs are going and deciding how to react to that at retail. Karen Short : Okay. And I know on the last earnings call, you'd indicated that you might be willing to give some more concrete data on what kinds of sales lift you're seeing in the optimized stores. Can -- are you willing to do that today? Can you give a little more color? J. Schlotman: Well, I think when you think about what we reported in the second quarter of 1.6% IDs, and if you were to factor out the headwind that's out there for space optimization and the price investments late in the first quarter, that we would have been over 2%. I think you see, one, that the headwind of that as well as what the potential tailwind that's out there. I won't get into specifics of exactly what those are generating. But as we see them -- as we see those stores coming out and what they generate and knowing that we're more than halfway through what we want to get done, we're looking forward to that turning into a tailwind late this quarter. Karen Short : Okay. And then I guess I just wanted to switch gears to the IDs a little bit and look at the spread between the new definition and the old definition. Obviously, you gave us the historical spread -- I mean, from last year in the net 8k. So obviously, that spread's widening. And I guess what I want to ask is it seems fair to think that, that spread will continue to pretty meaningfully widen as we go forward given the strong growth in digital, is that fair to think about? Because I mean, I think at the end of the day, people still want to get some sense of where your IDs are excluding the digital component. J. Schlotman: Well, I spoke of the fact that we had broad-based ID sales growth that are -- on our operating divisions, with 20 of them having positive ID sales, and that would have been on the traditional calculation. That would include ClickList, because they're fulfilled at the store level and would have always been in there. So we're happy, very happy with the trends we're seeing. Obviously, that's disrupted by the space optimization. Space optimization and the price investments at the store level don't really affect things like Ship and Kroger Specialty Pharmacy. W. McMullen: Yes, Karen, on your question as you look forward, we would certainly expect the gap to increase over time. It's becoming increasingly difficult. When a customer engages with us and they engage with us on Ship, they engage us -- engage with us on Vitacost and some of the other parts of our business. When they engage multiple places, we get a bigger share of their total and our total sales grow. But in terms of historically, the way we would keep track of that, it does change the mix and where -- how the customer's engaging with us, which is the reason why we changed the definition. But we would expect that gap to continue to increase as we become more multidimensional. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Mandeville with Jefferies. Chris  Mandeville: I guess I'm still a little bit uncertain surrounding the back half guidance here. Mike, just to be clear on the tax rate, you're implying that we're looking for an 18% tax rate in the back half. And if that's correct, then the Street expectations, at the very least, on EBIT is going to have to come down quite considerably. So just trying to get some incremental color on what's driving that versus what we were initially expecting back in March. Is it more in the gross margin line? Is it more OpEx? Just any color would be helpful there. J. Schlotman: I mean, when you look at the back half, I don't think we're that low on the tax rate. When you look at the 20% for the year or so, we'll probably be above that in the third quarter, maybe below that in the fourth quarter, because we do try to factor in when we might see things like the tax settlement that happened in the second quarter with 3 different states. There are things out there like that, that wind up happening as well. I'm not going to get into what our EBIT guidance might or might not be on a quarterly or annual basis, because we have guided that it will be down, and we do continue to make the investments we expected to make. And we are using -- we are making incremental investments in the business, using the tax savings that we spoke about in March. I would remind you that all of that said, we generated about $1.8 billion of free cash flow in the first half of the year, when you look at cash provided from operation activities minus our CapEx, which is the pretty standard definition. And we're promising $6.5 billion over the next 3 years. So I think we're off to a pretty nice start to the $6.5 billion. And when you think about the valuation of the company and its ability to grow free cash flow over time. I think we're pretty solid in that respect. Chris  Mandeville: Okay. And then one quick clarification, then the follow-up. The comp, you actually have seen over 2% in Q2. Was that both price investment and space optimization or strictly space optimization? W. McMullen: It's both of them together. Chris  Mandeville: Okay. And then -- so my follow-up would be just obviously as it relates to the pending storms, all are of course unique, but could you just remind us of the general dynamic that you observe on both on the top line and margins during these sort of events? And then how well do you feel from an inventory standpoint in advance of the hurricane? And did you see any element of acceleration in transportation or freight costs in the Southeast quarter-to-date? J. Schlotman: I don't know if I would go specifically to the Southeast, that's pretty narrowly focused. We talked that rising transportation costs affected the gross margin rate overall. When you look at the dynamics of what's going on in the Southeast of the country today, before I get into the specifics, I want to repeat something I said earlier today. And our hearts and minds and prayers and thoughts are with both our associates and customers in that part of the world, because they stand to face a pretty difficult next couple of 3 weeks. And we hope we come through it as well as possible from their standpoint, and the business will be the business. I would tell you that last year at this time, we had a run-up to Hurricane Irma that people forget about. And this -- and right -- and that would have been prior to today. Today, we have the run-up to Hurricane Florence and they kind of offset one another. So we had the comparison to the run-up to Irma that was a headwind at the beginning of the quarter, and now that's been replaced by the incremental sales you get from Florence. And when you factor those out, they pretty well negate one another. And we're trending above with both of those in there, where we finished the second quarter. So we feel like we're off to a good start. W. McMullen: Yes. And Mike said it, but there's no 2 hurricanes the same. We have a lot of experience on reacting and addressing hurricanes. And our teams always do an incredible job and work beyond anything that one could expect. But our customers and we all appreciate everything they're doing. Obviously, the first thing is making sure everybody stays safe. But I know yesterday, I received an email from a customer whose daughter lived in one of the affected markets. And she was -- in the email, she said how much she appreciated the fact that we had water and some other things, because other retailers didn't have it. And to the degree that we're able to do things like that, it really is a reflection of our store teams and our warehouse teams and delivery teams making sure that our stores stay in stock. And it's one of those things we do have a lot of experience at. J. Schlotman: Yes. And Rodney, when you look what our Atlanta, Harris Teeter and Mid-Atlantic division teams have done to serve the customers and keep our associates safe, our hats are off to them. Operator : The next question comes from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Kelly Bania : Just a clarification and then a longer-term question. On the space optimization, the comments that the IDs would be over 2% if you take that out. Is that more of a traffic disruption or a ticket and pricing disruption? W. McMullen: Yes, it actually is both, and it's more the average ticket because customers have trouble finding stuff, but it's actually a little bit of both. What we find, once you get through it, though, the customers -- you reallocate the space in the storage, you'll have products that the customer wanted to buy from us that we didn't have before, and we stay better in-stock as well because you reallocate space. So yes, the customers never like it during it, but once you get finished, the customers appreciate what you do and reward us accordingly. Kelly Bania : Okay. That's helpful. And then just some longer-term questions, I guess, first on Ocado. Just a simple question, but we saw the growth in Instacart and the expanded partnership there. It seems like the same-day delivery, maybe there's a lot of demand for that. But I'm just wondering if Ocado will be also able to offer same-day 1- or 2-hour delivery or if that's more of a next-day type offering? Any comments on that would be helpful. And then on Alibaba, just wondering if you're willing to frame what you think the potential could be for that longer term in terms of dollars when that starts, and if you'll include that in your IDs? W. McMullen: Yes, the -- in terms of Ocado, Tim and the Ocado team continues to work on improving their model, making it -- using even better machine learning and everything else. There will be certain areas that they will be able to do same day in. I think the key thing gets back to the comment that we've talked about regularly, and that's being able to deliver Anything, Anytime, Anywhere. And it really will be able -- the key will be able to -- for the customers to do it in a seamless way. And we'll use all of the assets, including Ocado, our store facilities and other things to be able to get deliveries to the customers based on when they want it. What we find is there are certain items that customers want more immediately, if you think about what's for dinner tonight. There's other things that you can help them plan out. And the thing that they're more focused on there is getting it in a convenient way. And a convenient way sometimes is picking it up, not necessarily at the store they shop at; and in some cases, delivery. So the key is all of the backstage assets tie in together, but delivering it seamlessly for the customer. And what we find is customers -- some customers like same-day or a couple-hour delivery window. Others are more focused on pickup. And next-day is not -- they view that equally as convenient. On Alibaba on the identicals, Mike, I'll let you... J. Schlotman: Our definition is sales to customers. So over time, those will probably wind up being in the ID sales. As we've said, we're kind of dipping our toe in the water at this point to make sure we have systems and processes down. And it's just an expansion of our ability to attract customers, regardless of where they are. W. McMullen: Yes. On Alibaba, and what I've been doing investor meetings recently on Simple Truth, the question they ask is the same thing in terms of how big. And it really is, for us, hard to estimate. It's something that we haven't done before. But what we find is that our Simple Truth brand has incredibly strong customer connection. And we believe that's a brand that will work across the world, not just the U.S. And learning and doing that in China is an easy first step. And Alibaba's Tmall is an incredible platform to reach over 0.5 billion customers. So it's really learning and looking at it in terms of is it a brand that will travel internationally, and then does that create a platform for growth. And we certainly think the opportunity is there. It's going to take a lot of work to achieve that. Operator : The next question comes from Paul Trussell with Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : Just circling back on margins. As you've mentioned numerous times, 2018 is a year of investments for you guys, and you pulled forward actions on labor and price and store remodels. Just kind of remind us -- or as we look to the second half, are there a different set of puts and takes that we should keep in mind versus the first half on the EBIT front? And just kind of remind us of what's embedded in that 2020 plan in terms of the margin profile. J. Schlotman: I won't get into EBIT on the short-term period like the back half of the year, because we haven't given guidance on that. What we've given guidance on is we expect to grow operating profit or EBIT by $400 million over the course of '18, '19 and '20 as compared to where 2017 ended up when you adjust out the 53rd week and you adjust out the convenience store business, because obviously we don't have that going forward, but we sold that for a very nice multiple. So that's what we're very focused on. We talked about the fact, in March, when the tax act was there that we're going to make investments that would reduce EBIT this year. That would be offset by -- on the bottom line by a lower tax expense, and from a cash base standpoint, a lower cash tax expense. And a lot of those investments were pull forwards from either later in '18, meaning there'll be less effect in '19, or actual pull forward investments from '19 into '18. So we will expect ourselves, from an internal standpoint, to grow EBIT more in '19 and probably into '20 than we would have in the original Restock Kroger, because we were able to get some of those investments behind us in 2018 and, hopefully, see those take root and create that extra EBITDA to support our strategy. Paul Trussell : Got it. And then just some quick ones. In this past period, to what extent did your private brands outperform national brands? And also if you can just give an update on the click-and-collect program and all the contributors to your digital growth being over 50% this past quarter. J. Schlotman: So in Rodney's prepared comments, he talked about Our Brands being 28.2% of units and 26.5% of dollars, both of which are record results for the second quarter. The second quarter is usually a bit of a dip as compared to the first quarter and other quarters, but -- primarily because of soft drinks. Because with the summer holidays, national brand soft drinks have a very strong performance because of the promotions that wind up happening. And when you look at the ClickList and the expansion of digital and the fact that it's up 50%, we talked about the fact that we're up to 80% of our customers now have the ability to either interact with ClickList or one of the home delivery services we have, which is up from about 70% in the first quarter. So we can see continued growth of our customers being able to interact with us that way. Operator : The next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : So Rodney, let me hit private brands first. If -- what have you found your data with price elasticity, private brands versus national brands? And then when you make some price investments on the private brands side, what is the national brand response, if any, to those? Or do they do nothing? W. McMullen: Well, I love the question, but there's a lot of pieces behind the question. If you look at Our Brands and the broad spectrum of Our Brands, each brand would have a little bit different answer to the question. So if you look at Private Selection, as a general rule, those are unique items where there really isn't a comparable brand somewhere else. So our brand on Private Selection really is very innovative, new approaches, same for like HemisFares and some of those. So the customer reaction is more in terms of doing something when we keep it fresh and exciting or a flavor that they can't find somewhere else, and that engages with the customer that way. Simple Truth really doesn't have a comparable brand in the market at all. And to the degree that obviously there is a lot of smaller natural and organic brands but it would compete against one piece of our overall brand, not the overall brand. And certainly, what our strategy always has been on natural and organic products is you don't -- shouldn't have to pay a premium. Just because it's natural and organic, it shouldn't have a higher margin in it. And that's been our strategy for numerous years, and our customers have reacted to that very well. When you look at the core banner brand, it really depends on the category. So if you think about milk, the market share is so high there's really not a lot of elasticity there; others would have a different type of elasticity. Overall, you really don't find the national brands reacting much at all in the short term. Usually, the reaction is more longer term and it's usually after a year or 2 of losing share that they decide that they want to do something about the share and then they'll come back and be more aggressive. The key to all of it, and we want all -- so we want the national brands and Our Brands both to grow, and one of the keys is innovation. And I know, almost every time I talk to a national brand partner, I always tell them that you need more innovation. Our teams feel the same way in terms of -- the key is really more innovation. John Heinbockel : And then real quick, on the $400 million, roughly what comp is required over the 2 years to get there? And with Ocado investments, right, as you start to move toward implementation of the first 3 or 5, would they impact the $400 million at all? Or no, it's immaterial? J. Schlotman: The peak of those investments won't start happening until 2020. And I -- it's factored into our ability to generate the $400 million. And we would still be targeting to generate the $400 million of operating profit margin growth even in light of having the Ocado investments and sheds starting to come online or close to coming online early, hopefully sometime in that time frame. Operator : Your next question comes from Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Robert Ohmes : Just a couple of quick follow-ups. The price investments, Rodney or Mike, can you just talk about how much of it is skewed towards own brands versus history? Is the -- is it a massive investment in your own brand pricing that's driving your gross margin down and you've eased off price investments on national brands? W. McMullen: It would really be across both national brand and Our Brands. And it really is using our 84.51\u00b0 insights to understand where is the best return for the price investments. So it's actually very much both. Robert Ohmes : And then just the very last question would just be some of your -- Walmart, example, as one example, you saw some strong results from some very large retailers even in their food retail businesses in the second quarter. And just maybe help us think about what the consumer is doing from your standpoint. Are you seeing signs of trade-up? And should we see a reversal of market share trends back in your favor at some point when you get through this? W. McMullen: Well, if you look at market share overall on the data, the way that everything's been historically tracked, we continue to gain share. If you look at overall, we're pretty much on track where we would -- where we thought we would be, as Mike mentioned earlier. We continue to see overall market growth, which is good. And we see great opportunities out there to continue to do well what we do good, and that's our strength with our associates and their service and freshness of product. So we continue to see plenty of opportunity to improve our identicals and gain share. As I just mentioned, we are incredibly confident about the future of Kroger and especially with our execution of Restock Kroger. One of the exciting things about our earnings call is that many of our associates listen in to better understand and gain insights into our business. And of course, as all of you know, many of our associates are shareholders as well. So before I end today's call, I'd like to share a few final comments with our associates. First, as Mike mentioned before, I'd like to acknowledge the many -- that many of our customers and associates are bracing for Hurricane Florence. I know our stores and logistics teams on the East Coast have been working tirelessly for the past week to help our customers and each other be prepared for the storm. For those of you in the hurricane's path, please stay safe and look out for each other. Second, as I mentioned earlier on the call, we are thrilled that Kroger was included in Fortune magazine's 2018 Change the World list for Zero Hunger | Zero Waste. This is such an awesome recognition of the work that each one of you are doing to help us achieve our goal. The same week we received the news from Fortune, Kroger was making news of our own. We added a bold new pledge to our existing Zero Hunger | Zero Waste commitments by 2025, and that was that we will be phasing out single-use plastic checkout bags. The feedback on that announcement has been enormous and overwhelmingly positive. I know everything that you are doing are the steps to make this become a reality. Thank you for all you do. That completes our call today. Thanks for joining. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Rebekah Manis, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Rebekah Manis : Thank you, Laura. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our third quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. W. McMullen: Thank you, Rebekah. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me to review Kroger's third quarter 2018 results is Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Schlotman.  At our Investor Conference at the end of October, we shared several big ideas. The defining idea is that we are transforming our business model through Restock Kroger and then beyond. We will grow market share by both redefining Kroger customer experience and alternative profit streams through complementary businesses and partnerships. Redefining the customer experience means offering customers incredible physical and digital experiences, a fantastic offering and friendly and caring associates. Delivering an exceptional customer experience through the Kroger ecosystem creates incremental new profit streams, which in turn drives the economic model that makes the seamless experience possible. In this way, our new growth model will be a virtuous cycle. This all means that Kroger is also reinventing our financial model. We're moving from a traditional grocer to a growth company with both a strong customer ecosystem that offers Anything, Anytime, Anywhere and asset-light, high-margin alternative partnerships and services. I will break it down a bit in more detail. Successful long-term businesses constantly explore new directions and adjacencies to grow their top-line.  At our Investor Conference, we highlighted one of the most successful to date, Kroger Personal Finance as well as several businesses under our 84.51\u00b0 portfolio, including our Kroger Precision Marketing media offering. Kroger Personal Finance delivered record year-to-date profit and is on track for their most profitable year ever. Our high-margin media business is strong and growing. Revenue for Kroger Precision Marketing, Powered by 84.51\u00b0, is up more than 150% year-to-date. One service line, our boosted products and search business, where advertisers can influence how their products show up on our sites, benefited advertisers with more than 700 million product impressions in the third quarter alone, personalized to Kroger shoppers, with click to conversion rates that are 2 to 3x the industry standard. We see tremendous potential in these asset-light, margin-rich businesses build off of a robust grocery supermarket experience, which is being redefined every day at Kroger. Nowhere is this more obvious than digital. Our digital sales grew by over 60% in the third quarter. Our seamless coverage area now reaches more than 90% of Kroger households. This includes Kroger Pickup and Delivery. Kroger Ship is now available in all supermarket divisions. Ship customers can shop from a curated selection informed by 84.51\u00b0 data and insights of more than 50,000 grocery and household essentials that matter the most to our customers, plus there are 4,500 Our Brand products available only from Kroger. We are aggressively investing to build digital platforms because they give our customers the ability to have Anything, Anytime, Anywhere from Kroger and because they're our catalysts to grow our business and improve margins in the future. As we stated at our Investor Day, we expect to be able to cover not only 100% of our customers but also the entire U.S. population. Our Brands continue to perform exceptionally well with customers and is one of the most profitable parts of our supermarket business. Our Brands made up 28.7% of unit sales and 26.6% of sales dollars, both of which are record third quarter results. Our Private Selection and Simple Truth brands saw strong sales, units and gross margin gains in the third quarter. Simple Truth and Simple Truth Organic is our fastest growing brand, with sales up double digits, again, in this third quarter. As we've shared previously, Our Brands account for 4 of the top 5 items sold through Kroger Pickup, and 41 of the top 50 items sold on Kroger Ship.  We have now been executing for 3 quarters our Restock Kroger Plan to create shareholder value by redefining the grocery customer experience, partnering for customer value, developing talent and living our purpose. We feel good about the progress and how everything is coming together. We are proactively investing for the future in stores and online and in our customers and associates. We are using our assets, especially our love of people and our love of food, to transform our business in ways that drive sustainable competitive advantage.  Now here is Mike to share more details on our third quarter results and to update you on our guidance for the fourth quarter of 2018. Mike? J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased with our net adjusted operating earnings per diluted share result of $0.48 for the third quarter. Strong fuel margins and continued execution of Restock Kroger contributed to this result. We continue to make several Restock Kroger investments in the third quarter. These included investments in price, especially in support of Our Brands and in space optimization, store remodels and technology enhancements.  Part of these investments will allow customers to buy Anything, Anytime, Anywhere from Kroger. As we discussed at our Investor Conference, space optimization is a massive undertaking, and we continue to expect to end the year with 600 stores completed. Our ID sales for the third quarter were in line with our expectation. ID sales were led by natural foods, pharmacy, seafood, produce and deli departments.  Looking at gross margin. We were pleased to see that our shrink rate continued to improve during the third quarter compared to the previous year. The gross margin rate reflects the timing and size of company's price investments compared to a year ago, rising transportation costs and growth of the specialty pharmacy business, which is a high-sales, low-margin rate business that generates strong gross profit dollars. Keep in mind that last year in the third quarter, our gross margin rate was higher than our typical run rate. For the third quarter in 2018, gross margin, excluding fuel, was actually higher than the second quarter of 2018. These fluctuations illustrate how results in a given quarter can vary based on the cadence of the investments we make in the business.  Part of our investments this year support the Our Brand strategy where we continue to offer high-quality products at a great value. The improvement in unit movement in the quarter demonstrates these investments are resonating with customers. We intended to continue investing in price to drive unit growth while also delivering on the bottom-line for our shareholders.  We are pleased that OG&A costs decreased by 20- basis points as a rate of sales. The significant improvements we are seeing from our focus on reducing store associate turnover is contributing to this positive movement. We continue to focus on productivity and waste and improvements in our cost to fill prescriptions and increased adoption of self-scan contributed to this improvement. Our investments in Restock Kroger in redefining the customer experience, partnering for customer value and developing talent will be paid for by cost of goods savings, strong ID sales and productivity gains. This will contribute to generating $400 million in incremental FIFO operating profit through 2020.  Now for an update on our fuel -- retail fuel performance during the third quarter. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was approximately $0.261 compared to $0.249 in last year's third quarter. The average retail price of fuel was $2.81 compared to $2.46 in the same quarter last year. We expect our tax rate for 2018 to be approximately 23%. Excluding the 2018 adjustment items, Kroger expects its tax rate to be approximately 21%. These rates reflect the third quarter adjustment related to a regular IRS audit. The IRS audit resulted in a reduction in prior year tax deductions at pretax reform rates and future tax deductions at post-tax reform rates.  Our financial strategy is to use free cash flow to drive growth while also maintaining our current investment grade debt rating and returning capital to shareholders. We continually balance the use of cash flow to achieve these goals. Over the last 4 quarters, we used cash to invest the combined $589 million in Ocado securities and Home Chef; contribute an incremental $185 million pretax through a company-sponsored pension plan; $467 million to satisfy withdrawal obligations to the Central States Pension Fund; repurchase 91 million common shares for $2.3 billion, which includes $1.2 billion repurchased with after-tax proceeds from the sale of Kroger's convenience store business under an accelerated stock repurchase plan. We paid $435 million in dividends and we invested $3 billion in capital, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities. At the end of the third quarter, we had approximately $546 million remaining under the current share repurchase authorization.  We remain committed to generating the $6.5 billion of Restock free cash flow by 2020 as part of our Restock Kroger Plan. We have working capital improvements built into this guidance and off to a great start with $100 million improvement in net operating capital -- net operating working capital, so far, this year. Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio on a 52-week basis is 2.72. Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio target is 2.3 to 2.5x, and we remain committed to bringing the leverage ratio back into the target range.  We are investing an incremental $500 million in our associates in wages, training and development over the next 3 years through Restock Kroger. This will be in addition to our continued efforts to rebalance pay and benefits while also focusing on certifications and performance incentives, career opportunities and training. In March, we also announced investing a portion of our tax savings in our educational assistance program, Feed Your Future, and an increased 401(k) match for nonunion associates. The average hourly rate for our store associates is more than $18 per hour when you factor in our comprehensive benefits that many of our competitors don't offer. We recently ratified a new labor agreement with the UFCW covering more than 13,000 Kroger associates in Columbus, Ohio. The agreement raises starting wages and accelerates wage progressions after 1 year of service. We are currently negotiating with UFCW for contracts covering store associates at Smith's in Albuquerque and Fred Meyer in Portland.  Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solvent wages, good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We continue to strive to make our overall benefits package relevant to today's associates. Our financial results continue to be pressured by inefficient health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions, which represent many of our associates on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.  Turning now to guidance for the remainder of 2018. We continue to expect identical sales growth, excluding fuel, in the second half to be similar to the first half results. We updated our GAAP net earning guidance to $3.80 to $3.95 per diluted share for 2013 (sic) [ 2018 ] from the previous range of $3.88 to $4.03. The change in GAAP guidance is due to the third quarter market value adjustment of $0.09 per diluted share for Kroger's investment in Ocado shares and does not reflect any future changes in the market value of those shares because those cannot be predicted.  On an adjusted basis, we maintained our net operating earnings guidance range of $2.00 to $2.15 per diluted share for 2018, and keep in mind that fiscal 2017 included an extra week. We continue to expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to be approximately $3 billion for 2018. And now I'll turn it back to Rodney. W. McMullen: Thanks, Mike. We're not quite through our first year of executing Restock Kroger, and we feel great about where we are. We are laser-focused on our customers and fulfilling their needs. We are clear on our vision to serve America through food inspiration and uplift. Our 2018 accomplishments and investments set us up well for 2019, and we are committed to delivering on our Restock Kroger financial targets by the end of 2020. We have a clear path through both redefining the customer experience and growing alternative profit streams. Now we look forward to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Vincent Sinisi of Morgan Stanley. Vincent Sinisi : I just wanted to ask a bit further on the alternative revenue streams. Since your guy's Investor Day, we, on the phone, of course, have been getting a lot of questions from investors as well around that. You called out today kind of the Kroger Personal Finance seeing nice results there, but can you just kind of give us a little bit more color on that specifically? And just kind of as a category alternative revenue streams, kind of what are some of the puts and takes? We know it's one of the more important components of your EBIT guide. W. McMullen: If you look at the October meeting, we went through several different ones. Obviously, today, if you look at -- we highlighted Kroger Personal Finance in October because we wanted everybody to see that we actually have a great track record of delivering against identifying new business opportunities and having it grow in a meaningful way that's actually substantial to us. One of the announcements that we made last year was the Kroger Precision Marketing where we're using the insights from 84.51\u00b0. All of those things are really based on the traffic from our stores and our digital properties in creating a seamless experience for customers. And all of those things that we're doing will help our customers shop one of our stores easier. And, like in the media experience, it will allow our CPG partners and other people to target specific customers through our pipeline. If you look at over the last 4 years, the compounded annual growth from a profitability standpoint has been 16%. If you look at our expectations as you look at '18 through '20, we would expect that to accelerate to 28% growth per year. And certainly, the progress that we're having in '18 would support the 16% that we projected based on the historical 4 years. Mike, anything you want to add? J. Schlotman: No. I think we also -- Rodney gave some color on the Kroger Precision Marketing. The fact that it's up 150% year-to-date and I think it's pretty impressive that the boosted search of relatively new product with 700 million product impressions just this third quarter. And when you get click-to-conversion ratios 2 to 3x industry standard, that's the kind of thing that keeps that momentum going and keeps third parties interested in continuing to have that boosted search. Vincent Sinisi : Okay. All right. That's helpful color. And then maybe just as a -- maybe a SaaS follow-up, just in the press release this morning, just with some of that price investment commentary, is that -- would you say kind of normal cadence, nothing out of kind of the ordinary? Or did you see any particular changes on the competitive front or by category this quarter? W. McMullen: Yes. I would say it was just -- if you look at the overall strategy, it's executing the overall strategy that we started -- what we talked about at the beginning of the year but we've been embarking upon for several years. So I wouldn't say anything out of the ordinary. As Mike mentioned in his prepared comments, last year's third quarter was higher than trend-line. The other thing, I think, that's important just to note is that we did have a couple new warehouses starting up and a warehouse conversion that also negatively affected the margins in the quarter. And those are one-time -- well, it will take a couple of quarters for those to get started up in the transition, but that also negatively affected the quarter. Operator : The next question will come from Karen Short of Barclays. Karen Short : So I just wanted to ask a question about full year guidance and the implied fourth quarter. So the range is pretty wide for 4Q getting kind of like $0.38 to $0.53. So I'm wondering if you could just give a little color on that and the puts-and-takes to operating margin. And then, I guess, maybe comment on the guidance in light of the fact that gas margins seemed pretty strong in the quarter-to-date. And I know in the past when that has been the case, you've pulled forward expenses into the fourth quarter or into the quarter -- whatever the quarter was where there were strong gas margins, so a little color there would be helpful. J. Schlotman: Sure, Karen. And the wide range, I -- we all agree here at Kroger that the range for the fourth quarter is quite wide, keeping it at $0.15. And it's purely driven by what you zeroed in on, and that's gasoline margins and where they wind up because they've been very volatile over the last several weeks, while a very strong year, they can turn pretty quickly both positively and negatively. And if you think about what one margin in gallon means to earnings per share or $0.01 margin per gallon means to earnings per share, it can equate to almost $0.01 a share. That volatility is what caused us to decide to keep the range fairly wide. It has nothing to do with our view of how the business is going to operate in the fourth quarter. It's purely, will margins continue to be strong? Will they get weak the next -- will they get weaker the next 5 or 6 weeks or where exactly will they go. And it's really, you're unable to predict where those margins go on a weekly basis so we just decided to keep it a little wider purely based on where gas margins may wind up in the fourth quarter. Karen Short : Okay. So is it fair to think though if they remain strong, you'll pull expenses into the fourth quarter? Or it's just impossible to predict? J. Schlotman: Yes. I wouldn't necessarily predict pulling expenses into the fourth quarter. If you look at where we're sitting here in early December, our promotional activity and our ads are pretty well set, how we plan to go to market over the holidays coming up and New Year's and even as we get into later January getting ready for the college football playoffs and the Super Bowl, all those big events. Those kinds of plans are pretty well locked and loaded and the supply chain is ready for those kinds of activities to come through. So to do a lot of other unusual things in the next, call it, 8 weeks, 8.5 weeks would be -- I think we're pretty comfortable with the plans we have in place. Karen Short : Okay. And then just a general question on the alternative revenue streams. I mean, presumably, those are high-gross margin and this quarter isn't really the quarter to see the flow-through, obviously, given the comparisons from last year, but gross margins were still a little lower than we were modeling. But any color on how to think about how alternative revenue streams will impact reported gross margin ex fuel going forward? W. McMullen: The -- I wouldn't -- longer term, I wouldn't say that we're really to a position to start giving some of the detailed insights. Your hypothesis is absolutely correct in terms of the margins in our alternative profit streams are significantly higher than the core business, which is one of the reasons why we want to make sure that we call it out and point it out. The other thing, as you know, that's incredibly important is in those -- in that space, it's typically very asset light. So if you look at Kroger Personal Finance, we have an incredibly strong partnership with the bank. The assets that's used to grow that business is reasonably modest. If you look at Kroger Precision Marketing, it's using insights and data to create that revenue stream so it's easily scalable as long as you're producing the results for your customers. So it's a piece that's incredibly exciting. In terms of giving some specifics, I just think it's still a little too early for that. Operator : The next question will come from Edward Kelly of Wells Fargo. Edward Kelly : Can we start with just IDs? Could you maybe talk about the cadence of the IDs throughout the quarter? What you're seeing so far in the current quarter? And any update on the optimization drag? I think, obviously, your guidance implies Q4 will be better. I'm just curious as to whether you're seeing some of that yet. J. Schlotman: Well, if you look at the cadence throughout the quarter, it was fairly consistent throughout the quarter. As you look at so far this quarter, we would be in the same range as where we ended the third quarter, so we've started off at about the same spot. When you look at space optimization and the fact that we're in the holiday season, we've been disciplined to not have stores disrupted during the holiday season, so we would expect to have those stores start to perform better like we talked about at the Investor Conference. We will start up next year -- space ops. We will start some stores in January after the holiday season. When you think about the slide I showed at the Investor Conference on space op, what we're seeing in ID sales for those stores is not materially different than what I showed back in October. Edward Kelly : All right. And then I wanted to ask you about SG&A. It was a positive surprise this quarter, for sure. Can you talk about your ability to drive 20- basis points of OpEx leverage this quarter? And you've been talking about cost discipline, right? Is this now starting to inflect into the P&L? And I'm just kind of curious as we think about things going forward, how we should be thinking about this line item? How important is it to your $400 million over time? Just any color there would be good in terms of like what this quarter means as to how we think about modeling going forward. J. Schlotman: Yes. I think what it means is a lot of what you said, and when you look at the areas that I called out in the prepared comments, when you think about retention, and our retention getting significantly better than it has, it does multiple things. One, you don't spend the dollars you have to spend to hire somebody, just the actual hard cost of getting somebody into the system whether you do a background check or any kinds of other screenings on the individual, getting them through a training program and then getting them on to the sales floor, at a productivity level lower than someone who has 6 or 9 months experience. So when you have more and more people who have that 6 to 9 months experience and start to get to the 12 months experience, that helps the productivity inside the store. More people then wind up staying, particularly the part-time workforce, as they start to understand and appreciate, when they're here 6 months, they start to get the benefit of Feed Your Future where they can get $3,500 a year towards furthering their education. That cost, while it sounds expensive, actually will be offset by that person staying for another 12 or 18 months versus having that person turn a couple of times and having lower productivity and training. So you kind of create a virtuous cycle and better opening wage rates, more contemporary benefits, helping them with their college education or GED or English as a second language. We have a lot of folks here work for Kroger in management positions that have decided to go back and get their MBA and other advanced degree certification. So all of those together help with that. We continue to see improvements in our cost to filling our pharmacies. Our pharmacy business continues to be a very strong piece. Our script count on a 30-day adjusted basis continues to grow nicely. And as we leverage that and are able to leverage down our cost to fill prescriptions, that certainly helps. And then the efforts we've had both on our front-end transformation that we tried to work in with space op, when possible, of reconfiguring the self-checkout units so that it's an easier, a more friendly experience for our customers. And then the added benefit of the Scan, Bag and Go, all of those help create productivity, which is a positive to it. A lot of things I said there. I don't know that I would promise 20- basis points going forward, but certainly cost reduction as we've been talking since we announced Restock Kroger on October '17 is a very important part of getting the $400 million of operating profit. W. McMullen: I agree totally with everything that Mike said. And I think the last part that Mike said is the important part. As you look at now through 2020, you should expect to see us reducing cost of -- how much cost it takes us to operate our business. And Mike gave a bunch -- several great examples, but we're really -- our operations team is doing a great job working with our stores and our technology team on some innovation ideas to improve processes and take cost out. So it's really all of those pieces working together. But absolutely, as you look out through 2020, you should expect us to improve cost and how much it costs us to operate our business. Operator : And the next question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS. Michael Lasser : In light of the fact that space optimization disruption should be a little less in the fourth quarter plus given the re-acceleration of your price investments, should we expect that IDs are going to meaningfully accelerate in the subsequent months over your fourth quarter? J. Schlotman: Yes. I think that the only place that would go on -- ID sales is our guidance as we expect the second half to be comparable to the first half. Our third quarter was close to the second quarter and our first quarter was a little better than the second quarter. So we do have a little bit of ground to make up on that guidance, but we didn't -- we said similar, we didn't say exactly equal to. But we are expecting a little bit better fourth quarter. We're working hard to do that. I think we have great plans in place. Michael Lasser : And Mike, what would be the offset to some of those benefits? Are there industry factors, consumer pressures? What are your thoughts there? J. Schlotman: I don't know what you mean by offset. Michael Lasser : Because you're going to see less disruption from space optimization and you should get a sales lift from the price investments that you've been making, so I'm just wondering if there's offsetting drags to those factors. J. Schlotman: Yes. I wouldn't point to any particular offsetting drag as it relates to the top-line. Keep in mind, our fuel rewards program continues to be incredibly important to our customers and our associates when they think about the total value that we give them on a day in, day out basis. And that $0.10 a gallon they get off, keep in mind, we reduce reported IDs for that because you have to buy groceries to get the lower fuel discount. Not all of our competitors account for it that way. So as that continues to be popular and more and more people engage in that, we're selling more in the stores, but it actually slows how quickly ID sales grow just because of the way we do our accounting. So there are always puts-and-takes on that top line. Michael Lasser : That's helpful. And my follow-up question is on Kroger Personal Finance. It's been seeing very healthy growth. What's been driving that? And how much of that is the private label credit card? W. McMullen: It's really all of the portfolio of products they offer. So in the last 2 or 3 years, we've done a couple of mergers with Roundy's and Harris Teeter so there's good growth there. There's good growth in the existing business. And then the credit card business continues to be an incredible tie-in for -- loyalty for Kroger customers, so it's really all pieces of that business continues to grow. Obviously, credit write-offs are low as well, but that' a pretty small part of the overall impact on the profitability of that business. Operator : The next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Kenneth Goldman : In the past, around this time of year, you've provided some initial thoughts about the upcoming fiscal year, at least, on some occasions. Mike, at the Investor Day, you did say, I think, 2019 has to have some, I think, the word you used was decent operating profit margin dollars. I just wanted to see if you could elaborate a little bit on that in terms of what you're expecting next year? Or in general for next year, are there any unique tailwinds, headwinds we should be thinking about? Just opening up that topic if we can. J. Schlotman: Yes. I won't go too far on 2019, but it's -- if you go all the way back to 2017 and then the first quarter of this year, when we talked about pulling forward some investments from '19 into '18, clearly, operating profit margin has to grow in 2019 over 2018 and start that march to the $400 million that we're going to generate over the 3 years of the Restock Kroger Plan. I will say, and I knew at some point we would get this question because we were a little -- we were pretty more prescriptive this time last year on the call about what we expected for 2018, and a lot of that had to do with the fact that we had a range of estimates out there at that point in time that were as low as in the $1.40s and $1.50s and up to above $2.20 kind of range. It was a massive range. And what we were trying to do was rein in that range as we got into the end of the year. And knowing that we were going to give guidance in March, we didn't want that wide of a range out there. I think, today, people are understanding that this is a 3-year program we're undertaking. And as we make -- as we pull those investments from '19 into '18, they should start generating a little bit more in '19, then even more in '20. So it is a 3-year growth of algorithm to get to the $400 million where we continue to see a clear path to the $400 million. W. McMullen: The other point that I would add, and we talked about it in October, is if you look at digital, our overall digital business continues to be a significant investment for the future of the business. And we would expect for '19, that to become a less of a headwind that it was in '18. And that is also an important part to remember as well. Kenneth Goldman : And then a follow-up. If I look at your SG&A dollars and -- they were down year-on-year if I exclude the one-time pension contribution last year, some extra weeks, it actually was down for the first time in at least 22 years according to my model. So I realize you're gaining efficiencies in store associates, I get that Personal Finance is a contrast SG&A item, but I'm still not 100% sure why that decline was so sudden. I mean, your SG&A came in $200 million below where The Street was. So can you help us understand a little bit of what the big dramatic change was in the quarter or maybe I'm just -- we're all just modeling it wrong and didn't see something. J. Schlotman: Yes. From a dollar standpoint, Ken, don't forget that last year would have had the C-stores in our OG&A rate and they're disposed of now in our dollars. Kenneth Goldman : Yes. But last quarter, in 2Q, it was still -- you still were up year-on-year with SG&A, so it was a little bit more of a dramatic change. I could follow it up off-line if it's -- I don't want to hold everyone up on the call. J. Schlotman: Hold on one second. W. McMullen: Ken, they're pulling up stuff to talk. Kenneth Goldman : I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do this. J. Schlotman: Yes. We were up a little bit in the second quarter. I would say the second quarter is probably more a function of, in the prior year, we would have had some bonus accrual reductions because of the year it was at -- where the year was heading that we didn't enjoy this year. Operator : The next question will come from Chris Mandeville of Jefferies. Chris  Mandeville: So as it was noted, you guys are doing quite well in OG&A but gross margins were a bit lower than what we were all expecting. Mike, can you just maybe help ballpark the impact on gross margins based on the noted items that you called out? And I know you don't necessarily like to guide to any one line item, but just given the particular strength in fuel margins that we're seeing quarter-to-date and how that plays into overall earnings, can you give us a sense of just how to think about gross margins ex fuel in Q4? J. Schlotman: Yes. If you think about that margin rate in Q4, I'm more comfortable doing that than listing out the effects in any one quarter of some of those things because 1 quarter is not an indication of where they go long term. The one I did call out is Kroger Specialty Pharmacy. It's a very profitable business. It has a very low margin rate. But because of the individual cost of those prescriptions for the patients, it generates very strong gross margin dollars which is why we're in that business. And as that business continues to grow, it will be a headwind. That one alone was a double-digit basis point headwind, but I won't give the exact amount. When you think about the fourth quarter, you should probably think about the fourth quarter change in gross margin rate the way we talk about that basis point change being more similar to the second quarter than the third quarter. Chris  Mandeville: Okay. That's helpful. And then just my follow-up. Over the last couple of weeks now, we've seen several sizable product recalls. And I think some of it was even specific to the Kroger brand in both meats and pet food. So I'm just curious on what Kroger has been doing of late or what it plans to do when it comes to supply chain and improving sourcing helping mitigate recall costs. W. McMullen: Well, if you look, food safety has been something that Kroger has been incredibly proud of for many, many years. And we have a team of folks here that, that is their only responsibility is to make sure that products are safe throughout the food channel. We will do routine audits of our suppliers as part of that process. One of the things that we are incredibly proud of is, in the unfortunate situation where there is a recall, we reach out to our customers and let them know that there's a recall on products they bought so that we try to get that customer to get the product back to us as quick as possible to make it easy on them and to let them know. It's something that we also review with our board on a regular basis. If you look at severity of incidents, we've actually, over the last 5 or 6 years, there's been a decline on severe incidents. Now if you look at overall recalls, it continues to increase just because I think the overall food safety chain in the U.S. continues to improve. Chris  Mandeville: Okay. And maybe just 2 quick housekeeping questions. What was inflation, deflation in the quarter? And was there any notable call-out from hurricane impacts on the comp or expenses in the... J. Schlotman: Yes. If you look at the hurricane impacts, it would have been a little bit of a headwind to ID sales. We didn't necessarily call it out primarily because it wasn't that dramatic, but it was several basis points of a headwind. More than a couple, but it's not like it was 20- or 30- basis points. So -- but it was meaningful, but not directionally going to change the answer. If you look at your question on inflation, deflation, I'm looking at my chart here. I have 30-year-olds that make a chart for their eyes, not my eyes. So if you look at inflation, deflation without fuel and pharmacy, on a cost basis, we had about 11- basis points of inflation. If you put pharmacy back into the mix, we had about 22- basis points of inflation. So a very benign environment. It ranges around the categories of who had some inflation and deflation, and there were some categories that had a little bit of inflation and others that had a fair amount of deflation. Operator : And our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : So on capital allocation, I was curious how quickly you anticipate being back to that 2.3 to 2.5x leverage ratio. And then as we look out to next year, I know you have $1 billion term loan coming due. So just curious if you have any initial thoughts in terms of whether you would pay that down or refinance that debt. J. Schlotman: So we actually have about $1.1 billion of long-term debt that is now classified as current coming due in, call it, the next 90 days -- or next 60 days. Some this month, some next month that we would anticipate refinancing that in the market. We do have forward -- we have forward starting swaps against both of the types of debt we would wind up expecting to issue at very favorable rates. The 30-years hedge is almost 100- basis points below where the 30-year is today, and the 10-years hedge is not quite that strongly but almost as strongly. We haven't decided exactly what we'll do with the term loan. It is -- some of our banks like the business, some don't like the business, but we certainly would have enough capacity with commercial paper to be able to use commercial paper to pay off the term loan if we chose to. So we'll have -- we always have a financial policy committee meeting with our board in January and we'll discuss our plans of how much flexibility do we want. If we rolled over the term loan, it keeps more revolver capacity so you can handle fluctuations day-to-day. Relative to the net total debt-to-EBITDA range, we are always in contact with the rating agencies. They understand what our program is and we are executing against the program we've described to them relative to them keeping our ratings where they are. W. McMullen: And it's important for us to get back into the range. J. Schlotman: Absolutely. Rupesh Parikh : Okay. Great. And then switching topics on price investments, so they clearly accelerated, I think, the past quarter or 2. So just curious in terms of whether the volume uptick so far -- thus far -- is meeting your expectations. J. Schlotman: Yes. I wouldn't -- I don't know if I would be as strong in the comment that they clearly accelerated. If you go back to each of the quarters so far this year, we talked at the end of the first quarter that we started making the pull forward investments in the fourth quarter. So from that standpoint, what we were pulling forward from '19 into '18, it's a fair assessment that beginning then, we did make those pull forward investments. I wouldn't characterize the third quarter as a big uptick in what our price investments plans were for the year. It's just that we continue to make the price investments throughout the year and it's more a function of how we made price investments last year a little bit choppier than we did this year. Rupesh Parikh : And are they meeting your volume expectations as far as the volume uptick... J. Schlotman: So we continue to be happy with what we're seeing from the results of the plan. It's not a single plan. It's not a single investment. So as with anything, when you make price investments in a wide range of things, there are those out there that you probably are getting more volume than you expected and some, not quite as much. Not everyone is perfect, but we're constantly stepping back and assessing all the results. Overall, I would say we're very happy with what our investments are giving us. I don't want to give the appearance that each and every one of them is perfect because that probably wouldn't be believable, but we are very happy with the collection of them. And the ones that are doing well, we do more of. And the ones that aren't quite so well, we try to tweak and -- or see what else might work. Operator : The next question will come from Judah Frommer of Credit Suisse. Judah Frommer : Just to follow up on the price investment first. Can you give us some insight to how internally the decisions are made around seeing better fuel profitability and kind of how quickly you can turn that in to pulled forward price investment. And then how should we think about that pull forward? Does it actually offset investments that you may have made next year? Or since the environment is so competitive, is there just this race to the bottom with everybody? J. Schlotman: I wouldn't -- it's obvious from some of the questions out there that there is this notion that when fuel profitability is very strong, we invest more in price and that's driving our gross margin down. I actually don't think that's true for this particular calendar year. We had a price program in place as part of Restock Kroger. We knew what we wanted to invest this year. Washington gave us a Tax Reform Act that lowered our cash taxes. We elected to pull some of our investments from '19 into '18 to get that expense behind us in the first year. The lower taxes start to drive better growth in those categories as we get into '19. I don't -- I wouldn't say that we've made any big moves on pricing as a result of strong fuel margins, it's just where everything shakes out. W. McMullen: Yes. The other thing, I think it's always important to remember when we go to market, our fabulous associates in terms of the great experience they deliver in fresh product is also important. So for us, it's the overall shopping experience that we're trying to create for the customer. And we're aggressively investing in the Anything, Anytime, Anywhere so they can do it anyway they want to, whether that's digital, delivery, pickup or physically in a store and have the same great experience and great fresh product in all those together. Judah Frommer : Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on the OG&A line. I would say, historically, your unionization was thought of as kind of a knock on the business. And today, I would say that the expansion into online and digital is seen as needing incremental investment in OG&A. But would you say we're at a point where the unionization may be helping you in some ways, given the tightness of the labor environment? And is there anything you can do to dispel online grocery necessarily adding meaningfully to SG&A or bringing down the margin there? J. Schlotman: I think when you look at our workforce overall, whether you're unionized or nonunionized, when I look at -- because not 100% of Kroger is unionized. And when I look at overall results in a unionized market versus a non-unionized market, whether it's -- at the end of the day, the OG&A rate and what you pay associates to perform their jobs, when you look at your employee relations, employee satisfaction, there's really not a tremendous difference between those, particularly in the wages. But we offer all of our associates a great health care option and if they're in a union, they're in a more defined benefit plan. If they're not in the union, they would be -- some of them will be in a defined benefit plan, but some are in a defined contribution plan. So it's really a mix of benefits inside those. When I look at some of the home delivery and the online stuff that you refer to, there's a lot of cost in that system that everybody can point to and say how you're going to do it. It's one of the reasons we joined up with Ocado to build the fulfillment centers that we're going to start building, and we announced the first one here in Cincinnati. While there are certain costs that will add as a part of the total supply chain for the customer, there are other parts of that cost that will come out of the supply chain -- more efficient picking because it's done robotically, it's done significantly faster on a 50-item order compared to how long it takes a 50-item order inside the store. I don't take product from the manufacturer to the warehouse to the store. I take it from the manufacturer to the Ocado warehouse, and then it goes right from there to a customer. So there's different efficiencies which is, overall, why we think that's going to help offset some of the costs people are worried about. Operator : And the next question comes from Paul Trussell of Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : Could you speak to any additional color around your digital business? I know you mentioned up 60%. Just kind of what you're seeing out of Kroger Ship versus pickup and Home Chef. In addition, if you can maybe just speak to the new pilot with Walgreens. W. McMullen: There's a whole host of questions there, and I'll just... J. Schlotman: That was a good one question. W. McMullen: I'll try to organize it in a way that makes sense. As you mentioned, our digital business overall grew over 60%. All pieces of the digital business continues to grow. The -- if you look at what was the biggest drivers of the growth, it would certainly be continuing to add locations where customers can pick up and get delivery. From an online standpoint and the stores that were -- already had it a year ago, their continued growth, and then Home Chef as well. Home Chef would be pretty much exactly where we thought it would be from a growth standpoint or where Pat and his team thought they would be and then we were part of it. If you look at Ship and some of the other pieces, it's still pretty early in the process. We would have had a lot more expenses in terms of setting up where all the systems worked versus so much of a sales driver. But obviously, over time, you would expect that to become more of a sales driver, but that is very early in the ramp. The relationship with Walgreens, it's -- both of us are very excited about what it can be, but it's one of the things where you really have to start small and learn from it. And that's really the prioritization is let's take baby steps and see if we can identify something that works for a Walgreens customer and a Kroger customer in some way that both of us can grow our business and make money. So excited -- that thing, I guess, I'm most excited about is when I spend time with our combined teams and their openness and aggressiveness on trying to identify something that's great for our customers, for both of our customers, is the thing that's so exciting. But it's pretty early to be able to start giving some more specifics than that. Paul Trussell : I appreciate the color. And then just to quickly circle back on inflation or lack thereof. It's clearly a benign environment in terms of the impact to your third quarter results. I just wanted to just circle back on your outlook as you think about what's to come over the next few months. Any change in your outlook on inflation, deflation impact to your results? J. Schlotman: Yes. I would say no. I don't really see a lot out there. I know there's a lot of noise in the marketplace about CPG companies pushing price increases through and the like. Over time, that -- we'll see where that goes and how everybody winds up reacting to it. Keep in mind, when we talk about inflation, deflation, it's relative to Kroger and not marketplace forces necessarily. So it's our cost of goods this year versus our cost of goods last year. And as everybody knows, a key component of driving the $400 million of operating profit over the next 3 years is continued improvement in cost of goods. So some of that deflation is actually doing things to get better pricing inside Kroger and that may not be something that's replicated at other places. W. McMullen: The other thing, I think, it's always important to remember is I always think it's a dangerous thing for CPGs to raise their cost more than what the economic cost of something increasing. And what we find, over time, when somebody does that, our own brands will pick up a disproportionate amount of share whenever somebody does that. So to me, it's a fine balance that we're all doing to try to find what's that optimal price point. Operator : And that final question will come from Robbie Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Robert Ohmes : Just a couple of quick ones. Sorry if I missed this. Mike, can you give us traffic versus ticket in the quarter? And maybe Rodney chime in, I'm just curious the tone of the customer through the quarter, were there any variances there? Are you seeing trade-up when you look at what they're doing? And then also, again, sorry if I missed this, but loyal households, is that -- was that still growing in 3Q similar to previous quarters? J. Schlotman: When you look at, overall, the basket value grew a little bit in the quarter, and that's primarily a result of mix of what's going inside the basket. When you look at transactions in the quarter, when you add in all of the entities, it was up a little bit in the quarter as well. W. McMullen: The tone of the customer, they continue to -- the economy still feels very good. People continue to buy wine, anything that makes their life easier, they will aggressively buy. So it wouldn't be anything -- and then from a household standpoint, we did continue to have a slight growth in households as well.  We are incredibly confident about the future of Kroger, especially with Restock Kroger. One of the exciting things about our earnings call is that many of our associates listen in to better understand and gain insights into our business. And of course, many of our associates are shareholders as well. So as always, before we end today's call, I'd like to share a few final comments directed toward them.  Last week, we celebrated Giving Tuesday. In conjunction with our partner, Feeding America, we set a goal to raise enough money to provide 4 million meals to those in need during this holiday season. Together with our customers, we raised enough to serve almost 6 million meals, helping us move closer to our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste goal of eliminating hunger in our communities. Last Friday, a major earthquake rattled Alaska. We operate 7 Fred Meyer Stores that were affected. And thankfully, all of our associates and customers inside our stores were safe. I'm so proud of the awesome job that Fred Meyer and Kroger team did. Under the leadership of Joe Grieshaber and our teams, everybody worked together to get all our stores opened within 1 day. Each holiday season, I'm reminded of our privilege to serve more than 9 million customers who shop with us every day. Every celebration or tradition is as unique as the customer who walks through our door. Among the hustle and bustle of the season, you welcome our customers and help to make their celebrations brighter. We lift our customers' spirits and they uplift our spirits as well. These are just a few examples of what it means to live our purpose to Feed the Human Spirit. It's an amazing thing of what we can do together.  Thank you for all you do for our customers, communities and each other. Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays and Happy New Year to you and your family and all those listening in. That completes our call today. Thanks for joining. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Rebekah Manis, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Rebekah Manis : Thank you, Laura. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our fourth quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. W. McMullen: Thank you, Rebekah, and good morning, everyone. Before we get started, I want to acknowledge that the team here at Kroger realizes that we have our work cut out for us as the market points out this morning. We realized business transformations are harder -- hard. But I want to emphasize we are on track to deliver on our Restock Kroger commitments. We look forward to our time together to take your questions and try to better lay things out for you. Joining me on today's call are Mike Schlotman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Gary Millerchip, for the first time, Mike's successor, who will become Kroger's CFO on April 4. As previously announced, Mike will continue to serve as EVP and a member of our senior team until the end of the year. We can't say enough how grateful the entire Kroger team is for Mike's service, leadership and stewardship of the company for the last 34 years, especially during the last 19 as CFO. We are also incredibly fortunate to have Gary, whose deep finance and business background combined with his successful track record of creating shareholder value as a member of our senior officer team, makes him the right person to carry Kroger forward. This is especially true as Kroger transforms from grocer to growth company. I've talked before about the need for retail companies to constantly reinvent themselves in order to remain relevant. This constant reinvention takes place at least every decade. Gary has been instrumental in helping us think through our transformation as part of Restock Kroger and beyond. He is uniquely positioned to be Kroger's Chief Financial Officer of the future and, as such, will also help shape the future of our omnichannel experience and reporting. During today's call, Mike will provide the financial and operations recap for the fourth quarter and full year 2018, and Gary will outline Kroger's guidance for 2019. In October 2017, we introduced Restock Kroger, our 3-year plan to create shareholder value by serving America through food, inspiration and uplift. The plan has 4 main drivers : redefine the grocery experience, partner for customer value, develop talent and live our purpose. Combined, these drivers come together to create shareholder value. Specifically, we committed to $400 million in incremental FIFO operating profit growth and $6.5 billion in cumulative restock cash flow by the end of 2020. I'm pleased to report that Kroger solidly delivered on our key year 1 Restock Kroger commitments. When you look at the full year, we delivered against our FIFO operating profit and our Restock cash flow goals, which sets us up to reach our 2020 targets. We improved identical sales and delivered EPS near the high end of our -- both our original and adjusted guidance range, giving us both business momentum heading into 2019. And I'm especially proud that we achieved our -- an unprecedented cost savings of more than $1 billion through process improvements in 2018. Restock Kroger is fueled by cost savings that we will invest in associates, customers and infrastructure. We continue to make significant investments to build an omnichannel platform that will deliver customers Anything, Anytime, Anywhere. At the end of 2018, 91% of Kroger households have access to pickup or delivery. By the end of 2019, with full integration of Kroger Ship into our ecosystem, we will reach 100% of America. We are very pleased with the growth of digital sales at Kroger. In 2018, our digital sales run rate was about $5 billion. Going forward, we are trending toward a run rate of approximately $9 billion. Kroger also grew Our Brands to reach a record 30.5% unit share in the fourth quarter. We introduced 1,022 new items in 2018, which helped drive strong year-over-year sales lift across our portfolio of brands. Simple Truth continued to lead the way with a 15.3% sales growth in 2018, making it a $2.3 billion brand. Kroger unveiled several transformative partnerships to create customer value in 2018. Home Chef continues to grow and shape today's meal solution space. In February, we announced Home Chef's expansion to 500 more locations and 6 new store divisions. Our pilots with Walgreens, Microsoft and Nuro continue to generate great customer insights. The Nuro pilot in Scottsdale is nearly complete, and we are planning to enter another market early this year. We remain optimistic about all the ways our partnership with Ocado will set Kroger up for accelerated growth in the future. In February, we announced Florida and the mid-Atlantic region is where we plan to build the next 2 Ocado sheds in addition to the first location planned for Southwest Ohio. In 2018, we accelerated investments in associates and significantly improved employee retention in one of the tightest labor markets in years. And we were thrilled to be recognized on Fortune Magazine's Change the World 2018 list for using Kroger's scale for good, engaging our business to solve society's most complex issues through Kroger's Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social impact plan. This groundwork positions us to deliver on our 2020 Restock Kroger targets, including financials, and transform the company for long-term growth. I want to take a few minutes to talk in more detail about our alternative businesses. Successful long-term businesses constantly explore new directions and adjacencies to grow their top and bottom lines. That's why in February, we announced the appointment of Stuart Aitken to the newly created role of Senior Vice President alternative business. In this new role, Stuart is assuming oversight for Kroger's successful existing alternative profit businesses, including 84.51\u00b0 and Kroger Personal Finance. Stuart will also lead the development of a full portfolio of alternative businesses to support the transformation of Kroger's business model and to better support our customers and supermarket business. Kroger Personal Finance, 84.51\u00b0 and media all beat their operating profit targets for the year. This was very encouraging as these are the biggest line items in our alternative profit businesses. We used some of the excess profit to invest into other new alternative profit streams to begin seeding our margin-rich, asset-light businesses of the future. In 2019, we expect 20% profit growth in our alternative businesses, and we'll also launch a few more new businesses that are both symbiotic to our core and deliver high margins. Plainly stated, Restock Kroger is all about transforming our growth model. We will grow market share by creating a virtuous cycle built on our grocery business. At the core is a winning combination of unmatched local presence coupled with a digital ecosystem that enables us to offer our customers Anything, Anytime, Anywhere. We are enhancing the customer ecosystem with partnerships that are helping us to redefine the customer experience by building incredible physical and digital experiences, a fantastic offering and unprecedented convenience. A constantly improving customer ecosystem generates traffic, customer data and insights, which then fuel the growth of adjacent alternative profit streams. We see tremendous potential in these asset light, margin-rich businesses built on the foundation of an omnichannel grocery experience. The profits generated by these businesses will create shareholder value and generate cash to invest in Kroger's core so we can further redefine the grocery customer experience. This is how Kroger's new growth model is a virtuous cycle. Above all, Restock Kroger positions Kroger to create long-term shareholder value. We have a clear path to achieve the $400 million in incremental FIFO operating profit growth and $6.5 billion in cumulative Restock cash flow by the end of 2020. We finished 2018 with sales and business momentum. We expect earnings growth and an improving supermarket business in 2019. Now here is Mike to share more details on our fourth quarter and fiscal 2018 results. Mike? J. Schlotman: Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Reflecting on Rodney's comments to start the call, it's kind of surreal to know that this is my 77th and final earnings call as CFO. I'm thrilled to be transitioning the role to Gary, who is a terrific partner and will be an excellent Chief Financial Officer. Looking at our results for 2018, I'm very proud of the entire team at Kroger for delivering on the key Restock Kroger commitments we made back in October of 2017. Landing the first year of a 3-year plan is always the toughest and most critical since everything that follows builds on the foundation that gets built. We feel great about the foundation we've built, which sets us up to create shareholder value while continuing to make strategic investments to grow the business. There were a variety of factors that affected fourth quarter in either the OG&A or gross profit line. As a result of better retention and higher average hourly rate, our vacation accrual was a $0.02 headwind in the quarter and incentive pay because of achieving the ID sales we did, and the [ CPS ] was a $0.06 headwind. Both of these affected OG&A. As I said, our incentive plan was primarily based on the grid of EPS and ID sales. As EPS got closer to the top end of the range, we were incentivized to continue to make sustainable investments in our business to grow sales. Some of these investments were in our supply chain for both supermarket business as well as Kroger Ship. On a combined basis, this was about $0.04 per share. These items affected gross profit. When you add these together, it was about a $0.12 headwind to the fourth quarter, a lot of which is something that we're going to be able to build on for the future. Our cents per gallon fuel margin in the fourth quarter was $0.34 compared to $0.198 in the same quarter last year. The average retail price of fuel was $2.34 versus $2.46 in the same quarter last year, which affected total revenue. For 2018, our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.252 compared to $0.206 for the year before. The average retail price of fuel for 2018 was $2.66 compared to $2.36 in 2017. The solid investments that we've made in 2018 will help the supermarket business have a better 2019 overall. We do, however, expect fuel to deliver lower operating profit margin in 2019 compared to 2018. Identical sales momentum continued into the fourth quarter where our ID sales result was about 10 basis points improvement over last year's fourth quarter. There is no doubt that weather events and the acceleration of SNAP disbursements helped ID sales results in the fourth quarter. It's difficult to distinguish between the 2 because they occurred at essentially the same time. Combined, snow and SNAP helped ID sales by 44 basis points in the quarter. We continue to feel good about our ability to meaningfully connect with customers who rely on SNAP to supplement their food purchases. While space optimization was a slight headwind versus the slight tailwind we expected, we saw strong progress. Stores that had been open for 12 weeks and unaffected by a new competitor had positive results in the quarter. And admittedly, this is taking longer than we originally expected, but we are pleased to see this result. In 2018, we completed the most disruptive of the remodels. As we go through 2019, the work will be more targeted and, therefore, less disruptive to our customers. All in all, the tide for space optimization is turning as we head into 2019. FIFO operating profit for the fourth quarter was $621 million compared to $782 million in the same period last year without the 53rd week and the 2018 and 2017 adjustment items. For the full year, FIFO operating profit was $2.84 billion compared to $3.13 billion in the same period last year without the 53rd week and the 2018 and 2017 adjustment items and excluding the convenience stores. This was above our goal for the year. And as Gary will discuss in a few minutes, we expect to grow again in 2019, and we remain committed to reaching our Restock Kroger goal at 2020. Kroger's financial strategy is to use its free cash flow to drive growth while also maintaining its current investment-grade debt rating and returning capital to shareholders. The company actively balances the use of cash to achieve these goals. Over the last 4 quarters, Kroger has used cash to invest a combined $589 million in Ocado securities and Home Chef, contribute $185 million pretax to a company-sponsored pension plan, repurchased 79 million common shares for $2 billion, which includes $1.2 billion repurchased with after-tax proceeds from the sale of Kroger's convenience store business under an accelerated stock repurchase plan. We paid 434 -- $437 million in dividends and invested $3 billion in capital, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchase of leased facilities. We remain committed to generating the $6.5 billion of Restock cash flow by 2020 as part of Restock Kroger. And in 2019 (sic) [ 2018 ], we delivered $1.9 billion. Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio on a 52-week basis is 2.83. We intend to use our free cash flow to bring the leverage ratio back into the target range of 2.3 to 2.5x. The company's intention is to not buy stock back until we get into that range as we did in the third and fourth quarters of 2018. We are investing an incremental $500 million in our associates over the 3 years of Restock Kroger. This is happening in a variety of ways, including investments in wages, training and development. In 2018, we made significant investments in wages and used tax reform dollars to invest in our educational systems program, Feed Your Future. We also increased the 401(k) match for nonunion associates, among other benefits aimed at an improved associate experience. This was in addition to our continued efforts to rebalance pay and benefits while also focusing on certifications and performance incentives, career opportunities and training. The average hourly rate for our store associates is more than $18 per hour when you factor in our comprehensive benefits that many competitors do not offer. Looking now at labor contracts. We recently ratified a new labor agreement with the UFCW covering Smith's in Albuquerque. We are currently negotiating with the UFCW for contracts covering the store associates at King Soopers in Denver, Fred Meyer in Portland, Ralph's in Southern California and Kroger in Memphis. Looking ahead, we have several major negotiations in 2019, including contracts for UFCW store associates in Seattle, Las Vegas, Indianapolis and Louisville. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We continue to strive to make our overall benefit package relevant to today's associates. Our financial results continue to be pressured by inefficient health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions, which represent many of our associates on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. Before I hand it off, I want to reiterate again that the first year of a 3-year plan is difficult to land the first year. But when you step back to review the full year, we feel great about delivering on our financial commitments while continuing to make the investments that will position Kroger for growth in the future. This solid foundation sets us up to transform Kroger and to deliver in 2019 and 2020. And now I'll turn it over to Gary to discuss how we'll build on this momentum in 2019. Gary? Gary Millerchip : Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to join the call today and more specifically, speak to Kroger's upcoming year, both what we are committing to and how it aligns with the Restock Kroger. For 2019, identical sales growth excluding fuel, we are targeting identical sales that range from 2% to 2.25%. We expect net earnings to range from $2.15 to $2.25 per diluted share and FIFO operating profits to range from $2.9 billion to $3 billion for 2019. The low end of our range is above the current consensus estimate for 2019. Kroger's EPS growth is expected to come from FIFO operating profit growth in 2019, which positions us well to deliver the incremental $400 million in FIFO operating profit by the end of 2020 through Restock Kroger. I'd like to spend a few moments underscoring Kroger's future growth model because the clear path to $400 million in incremental FIFO operating profit includes alternative profit streams. And although these high-margin and asset-light businesses won't have a major impact on our top line in the near term, they play a significant role in helping us achieve bottom line growth. I have made it a priority to join Mike and Rebekah already for several investor meetings. We as an Investor Relations team recognize and appreciate the request to better understand how to model alternative profit streams going forward. Please know that our finance team is spending time on this very topic, including a review of industry best practices with the goal of providing more detail in the future. In 2018, there were several Restock Kroger successes that have created tailwinds we believe will help us continue to grow sales and achieve incremental FIFO operating profit in 2019. We pulled forward price, digital and store investments in 2018, in part using tax reform dollars, which will create tailwinds for sales and operating profit in 2019. We achieved significant cost savings in 2018 and have plans to accelerate this momentum in 2019. Our largest alternative businesses, Kroger Personal Finance, 84.51\u00b0 and media, all beat their operating profit targets in 2018 and have plans for continued growth. And while investing to build a seamless ecosystem remained a headwind to earnings in 2018, that dynamic is beginning to shift. As Mike shared in his comments earlier, fuel is expected to be a headwind in 2019 compared to last year. The strength of fuel margins in 2018 helped us make investments that set the supermarket business up well for 2019, but we do expect softer fuel results this year. Looking at the cadence of EPS throughout the year, we expect the first quarter to be comparable to the first quarter of 2018, the second and third quarters to be within our annual guidance range and the fourth quarter to be above the guidance range, which will allow the full year to land within the range. We anticipate that momentum will build throughout the year and put Kroger in a position of strength going into 2020. We laid the foundation in 2018, which we'll now build on in 2019 to deliver our 2020 commitments. This includes Restock cash flow. We delivered what we expected in 2018, setting us up to meet our $6.5 billion cumulative Restock cash flow commitment by the end of 2020. We expect capital investments, excluding mergers, acquisitions and purchases of leased facilities, to range between $3 billion and $3.2 billion in 2019. This number will likely grow in future years as we announce more Ocado sheds. As Mike also shared earlier, in the short term, our intention is to use free cash flow to bring our leverage ratio back into our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. And finally, we anticipate Kroger's 2019 tax rate to be approximately 22%. Before I turn it back to Rodney, let me say that I'm incredibly grateful to Mike, who has put together a thoughtful week-by-week transition plan. He really has been the best partner I could ask for when transitioning to the role of Kroger's future CFO. Thank you, Mike.  I am personally very energized to be in a sector that is transforming as quickly as grocery retail. The way we think about the fundamentals of retail is rapidly evolving, which will make next few years incredibly interesting for the financial stakeholders who follow this space. And now I'll turn it back to Rodney. W. McMullen: Thank you, Gary. As America's grocer, Kroger has the winning combination of local presence plus a digital ecosystem, enhanced by strategic partnerships, enabling us to offer our customers Anything, Anytime, Anywhere. We are transforming from grocer to growth company by deploying our assets to serve even more customers and create margin-rich alternative profit streams. We are well positioned to deliver on our Restock Kroger vision to serve America through food inspiration and uplift. Now we look forward to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Karen Short of Barclays. Karen Short : So I guess, a question I have -- and I know you try to encourage us not to look at your business in terms of the core and fuel and alternative profits, but you did kind of gave us the slide at the Analyst Day with that depicted, so it's hard not to look at your business this way. But when I look at the full year '18 and I try to break out what the core business actually did, the decline was fairly significant. Like I'm kind of backing into almost 30% decline in the quarter. And I guess, can you help me understand what the components of that are that are maybe just transitory? And then the second part I would just ask is, obviously we're trying to think of you in a way that you're thinking of yourselves, meaning as a growth company. But you need stability in your core to have the credit in your valuation for being a growth company. So maybe a little color on how you can attain that, I guess, stability and/or grow your core. J. Schlotman: I'll take that one, Karen. Well, obviously, a lot of -- we made a lot of investments in 2018, which affects a wide variety of different lines. And it's difficult to say, obviously fuel had a good quarter or -- and a good year. When you look at trying to back into the core, what do you do with digital, which has been a headwind, and we continue to invest in digital. If you don't back that headwind out and put that in the growing a new business category, yes, that would drag the core down the way you do it. But if you look at the digital investments we've made along with the other investments we've made, in the fourth quarter, I talked about the new warehouses that we opened up to support our digital business. That -- if you look at that all in the core, yes, the core declined. I won't go into a specific number, but it really is how you slice and dice all of this. All of that said, and I wouldn't necessarily discourage you from looking at the different pieces of the business because we do have to do a better job of helping you all understand and explain where the alternative profit streams are going to come from because some of them won't affect the top line. Some of them will just be profit. But when you're trying to transform the company and you have a first year of a plan, we take all the pieces and all the available flows and profitability together and then decide how to invest them in which business, which is what we did in 2018. W. McMullen: And with that said, and Gary mentioned it, we will definitely do a better job helping you be able to see that insight because we certainly understand the question and it makes total sense. Karen Short : Okay. And I guess, just a follow-up, then. So if we look at that $3.5 billion for 2020, I mean, you're looking at an EBIT growth of 17%, which is not something I've ever seen any grocer do in a year. But is there anything that has changed in terms of each of the streams versus where you're at in your Analyst Day in terms of the growth rate? Gary Millerchip : This is Gary. I think we feel, as I mentioned in the prepared comments, we feel very good about the 2019 plan that we have for the business. And kind of referring back to your question, Karen, that you asked and Mike answered, there's a lot of noise obviously in 2018 when you're going through a major year of transition. And we feel that as we head into the second year of the plan, as the pieces come together and we have the tailwinds from some of those investments that we made, we have a strong plan in place that we feel is going to make a difference to the way in which growth is occurring across the organization and where you'll see that in the results that we report out as we shared in the prepared comments. I do think that as we head through 2019 and we're building on the plans that we put in place through Restock Kroger, we expect to see the investments that we made in '19 start to come out in -- sorry, 2018 come through in 2019. And we have a very clear plan of what we expect those benefits then to deliver in 2020. So I think we appreciate, to Rodney's comment, that we have to give you a clearer view into how all those pieces fit together. But I wouldn't say there's anything materially changed in the plan that we have for the 3 years and that we're not seeing all the pieces come together in largely the way that we expected. J. Schlotman: Karen, one more thing I would add on the calculation of the decline. And you may have done this, but I would remind you that last year had a 53rd week. And you need to take -- obviously take that out when you compare 2017 to '18. And I think last year, we said that extra week was worth $0.09 or so. Karen Short : Yes -- no, no -- yes, we backed everything out. J. Schlotman: Okay. Because I wouldn't come up with a number anywhere near where you are. Karen Short : Maybe we can follow-up. Operator : The next question will come from Edward Kelly of Wells Fargo. Edward Kelly : First thing I wanted to do, is maybe just follow-up on where Karen was going with this. I mean, on the $400 million goal, if we just think about how you started year 1, which you say is on track, but EBIT fell over $200 million. And it would've been down more if not for an epic fuel year. And the biggest decline was in Q4 even if you adjust for that extra week. And I know that you are reaffirming this target, but if you look at 2019 guidance, it's got about $100 million improvement. And it does sound like -- and this is off a big investment year, it does sound like there are some things that should come back to you, which implies a $550 million improvement in 2020. So why isn't there more progress, I guess, in 2019 given what you're going to lap? And then can you give us more comfort around how you see this growth in 2020? I mean, obviously, your stock is down quite a bit today because I don't think the market's seeing progress. The market is kind of seeing the opposite. So if you can just help us to some extent here, I think it would be good. J. Schlotman: A couple -- a lot of thought there in your question. One of the things I would point to relative to progress we're making is what Gary said in his prepared comments where if you look at operating profit guidance for next year, it is above where the current consensus estimate is. So in our mind, that does demonstrate progress. When you talk about why wouldn't 2019 grow more given the investments we made in '18, we are expecting a more usual year for fuel margins in 2019 versus 2018. We believe it would be -- it wouldn't be prudent to budget 2019 to replicate 2018 in fuel. So the core business and the alternative profit streams, digital not being as big of an investment, in fact, a little bit of a tailwind when you look at expected investments year-on-year. We first have to overcome in 2019 lower expected operating margin in fuel and then grow off of that. And as we built the business plan with the 2 to 2.25 EBITDA -- or [ ID ] sales, that still gets us to an operating profit margin that's above Wall Street. And if you look at the high end of that range, it's essentially right at what Wall Street would be predicting for 2020. W. McMullen: Ed, I mean, we really understand your question. And just to enhance a little bit of what Mike and Gary was talking about, digital, we do expect it to turn to a tailwind versus a headwind. As you know, we accelerated a lot of investments into 2018 that we expect those to pay off in '19. Mike talked about some of those. Obviously, space optimization is one of those. We continue to make great progress on taking costs out of the business. And when you look at all those together then, as Mike mentioned, we also expect fuel to be a headwind when you look at next year total. So totally understand the question. And when we look through and modeling all the pieces, I do think it's important to note when you look at fourth quarter by itself, the incremental $0.12 of charges that Mike talked about, most of which will not reoccur next year. Or if they do, they will be spread out throughout the year versus just in one quarter. Edward Kelly : Okay. Just a quick follow-up on the gross margin. The gross margin, down 93 basis points was certainly surprising. It does sound like there are some onetime things in here. But can you just give us a little bit more detail on what happened? What is mix by the way? And what did you do in supply chain? And then how do we think about the gross margin in 2019? Because it's hard to get to your EBIT guidance without, I think anyway, flat to positive FIFO gross margins ex fuel. J. Schlotman: If you look at the fourth quarter decline, about 1/3 of it, maybe a little less than 1/3 of it was from price investment. So kind of what we've been experiencing all year long. The other 2/3 of it is a combination of startup costs for some new warehouses that negatively affected warehouse and transportation line, that expense line that's in the gross profit as well as continued growth in primarily our Kroger Specialty Pharmacy team had a great year, very strong sales growth out of them. That is a high-growth business that has, as compared to our core business, a dramatically lower gross margin rate. But because the price of each one of those prescriptions is so high, generates very strong operating profit dollars in that business. So those last 2 were about 2/3 or so of the margin erosion and pricing was about 1/3. Edward Kelly : And just for next year? J. Schlotman: Yes, I don't think I'm going to give guidance for OG&A and gross profit for next year. If you look at the ID sales, if you look at the earnings per share guidance and we gave you operating profit, there are assumptions that you're going to have to make about where OG&A and gross profit are going to go next year. As Rodney said, some of those investments we made this year won't be as dramatic as they -- as next year. Things like digital not being a headwind and being a tailwind will help margins as well. So we won't be opening new warehouses like we did in 2018. And those startup costs are what cost us on the margin line. Operator : And our next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : Let me start. When you think about the next couple of years, the alternative profit stream impact on margin rate, EBIT margin rate, right, is the greater impact going to be on gross margin line or the expense ratio line? And then when you guys talk about ex fuel margin, does that include the alternative profit streams today? And will it in the future? Or you'll break that out? Gary Millerchip : Yes. On the first question, as I alluded to, we're doing a lot of work right now to really decide how we best can share that story with you because I think as we mentioned in the past, the alternative businesses that we talk about have grown up a little bit as a legacy over the way they would have been within the Kroger business prior to us really in 2017 identifying this as a big strategic growth area for the company and how do we truly leverage all the data and the knowledge that we have about the customer to drive those alternative businesses across Kroger Personal Finance, the media business and some of the other areas that we shared at the analyst meeting. So right now, it would be reported in a number of different areas of the business. And what we really want to do is to make sure that we're very deliberate in identifying and helping you -- provide you with a clearer picture of how you can see that more clearly as the business continues to accelerate growth in 2019 and 2020. J. Schlotman: And John, if you look at the OG&A and the fuel -- and the margin rates, excluding fuel, it would include those businesses. We would have a really long list of things to pull out if we didn't do it any other way. John Heinbockel : All right. So then as a follow-up, is it possible based on what you said, Gary, is it possible that there will be an alternative profit stream segment? Because again, it's getting so significant. It's so different than the core business, does it makes sense to break out separately for all of them, right, combined, revenue and EBIT? Is that something you're thinking about or amenable to? And then the last thing, if you think about the core business, what comp do you think you need to actually grow EBIT in the core business? Is it 2? Is it -- or given cost pressures, is it higher? Is it 3? What do you think? Gary Millerchip : I think for the first part of the question, we're not ruling anything out right now. We're not committing either to what the answer would look like. We really want to make sure that we're deliberate about thinking through the best approach to make sure that we manage this business effectively, but also can clearly demonstrate and show the story of the value it's driving to the bottom line. But certainly committed to reaching some conclusions on that and being clear in 2019 about how to think about and see that. W. McMullen: And certainly, when you look at the longer-term model, the 2% to 3%, we would certainly agree with that and would see the same number. For the next couple of years, it might be a little on the low end of that to drive earnings growth. But over time, the sustainability of the model really needs 2% to 3% identicals. J. Schlotman: I think it's important to note, John, that if you look at our productivity gains during the year from -- not only from the great year we had from reducing our turnover, which means we increased retention as well as some operational efficiencies inside the store. Our productivity pretty much offset the higher investments we made in associates in the store. Operator : And next, we have a question from Paul Trussell of Deutsche Bank. Paul Trussell : Just wanted to touch base on the top line. The IDs over the past year were more in the 1.5 to 1.9 range, and just wanted you to just maybe help us better understand the expectations to see acceleration in the business to kind of above 2. Maybe just speak, give a little bit more color on what you're seeing in the stores that have gone through the optimization. And we'll start there. I have a follow-up. W. McMullen: I love the question. If you look, the last part of your question on space optimization and as Mike mentioned in the prepared remarks, it certainly has been a headwind longer than we expected. But for the stores that have opened -- that opened or remodeled longer than 12 weeks, we're finally starting to see where that positively adds to our identicals. So it's been slower than we expected, but it's nice to finally see. So obviously, that's a piece of it. We also expect to continue to see improvements from the investments that we made in 2018. If you look at tonnage in '18, it was actually stronger than what the identical sales growth would be. And we continue to see people trading up in products and in size of products as well. So when you look at the maturation of the remodels that we've done, continuing to improve the way -- we've significantly improved in-stocks in some of the core business pieces and tying that all together with the investments we've made is what gives us confidence in the 2% to 2.25% that we shared. J. Schlotman: One other thing relative to that, Rodney, is when you look at quarter to date, we are essentially right on top of where our fourth quarter was. And the split between the core supermarket business and the alternative businesses is very similar to where the fourth quarter ended. I know there's a lot of rhetoric out there that the pull-forward of SNAP means that we've started the year out more slowly, but we're essentially right on top of where the fourth quarter ended so far here in the first quarter now. It's a 16-week quarter. A long way to go, but we are off to a start that helps us feel good about the guidance. W. McMullen: And Mike's point on SNAP, it definitely -- there was definitely a pull-forward. And when you look at SNAP by itself, the first period of the year would be a headwind. But if you look at other pieces... J. Schlotman: It would be a headwind, but we filled that headwind with other sales in the supermarkets. Gary Millerchip : Just maybe one other color to add too. As we think about the journey from Restock Kroger in '18, a lot of the initiatives that we landed during the year that created some of the noise that Mike referred, but really should start to build tailwinds into 2019. Rodney mentioned that the turning point from a profitability impact of digital. But as we continue to grow digital sales at the rates that we're seeing on a much bigger number, that continues to have a bigger influence as we head into the outer years of Restock Kroger on the ID sales performance of the business. And then the work that we did in 2018 to invest in our own brands and driving significantly high customer engagements as customers continue to deepen their relationship with our own brands is an important piece of the, I think, the opportunity that we see in 2019. And then finally, the merger with Home Chef and the work we're doing to expand the fresh food experience in the store and the meal kits opportunity obviously only came in partway through the year and represents another opportunity that we see to really build momentum in '19 from '18. Paul Trussell : That's helpful color. And somewhat related, I'm curious what you're seeing over the past few months and what you're forecasting ahead on the inflation front. And if you could just kind of comment a bit more on how we should think about price points given higher input costs? Are you seeing price points go higher? And also to what extent -- or how would you describe kind of the price environment out there? Is the environment rational? J. Schlotman: Yes, I don't know if I'll get -- if I'll grade the environment to rational or irrational. This is a competitive industry. It's always been a competitive industry, and we always build a business plan assuming it's going to be a little bit more competitive versus less competitive. And if we get surprised and it's not more competitive, it winds up being a help. If you think about inflation just in the fourth quarter and you take out fuel and pharmacy, cost inflation was less than that. It was about 39 basis points. When you add in pharmacy, it kicked up to 1.08 basis points. For the year, it's actually without pharmacy was slight deflation on the year from a cost basis, which is -- may not reconcile with everything you're hearing about cost increases coming through. Our team's done a phenomenal job of going after cost of goods savings in a variety of ways. And keep in mind, the numbers I'm talking about is what we pay for products based on how many of those units we have this year and last year and the price this year and last year. So we've done a great job of being able to offset some of those cost increases you hear about. W. McMullen: The other thing that I would add, and we talked about this before, but when you look at some of the companies, they've raised prices more than what the true cost is. And it's -- it really helps that our own brands are so strong because what we find is when somebody does that, they end up giving up market share and they give up market share to our own brands. And over time, we make more profit on Our Brands than we do selling the national brands. Now we're going to always give the customer choice and we want to earn whatever we get. But if somebody's pushing costs through more, they will end up giving up share when they do that. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Mandeville of Jefferies. Chris  Mandeville: Can we just start off again with 2019 guidance here? How much of this $100 million to $200 million EBIT growth is essentially going to be coming from your core grocery versus your alternative revenue streams? And how are you thinking about the fuel margin in 2019? And then I suppose, Mike, I can certainly understand that you don't want to go line for line on guidance. But clearly, the market is reacting to the negative 93 basis point gross margin results. So maybe just at the very least, you could hold our hands a little bit going into the first half of the year on gross margins and how to think about that as alternative revenues become a greater component of your EBIT. J. Schlotman: Yes, I understand your request to hold your hand a little bit, but we're going to stick with the guidance we've given and not get specific on gross margins and things like that. I would say a big chunk of the growth in operating profit margin for next year would be coming from the core business with ID sales like we talked about. We do expect, as I said, fuel to be a pretty dramatic headwind next year, which leads us to the bottom line result of the guidance Gary talked about in his section. W. McMullen: On fuel, we would be pretty close to using our 3-year average on margin in terms of expectations of fuel. We do skew that a little bit to more recent times, but it's pretty close to the 3-year average. On gross margin, you should not expect a 93 basis point reduction in gross margin. J. Schlotman: That I agree with. W. McMullen: And if you look at the model overall, as you know, we've accelerated a lot of the investments. And some of the things showing up in [ gross ] is just the way the accounting shows in terms of warehouse and transportation cost. So those types of things, we would not expect that same headwind. Chris  Mandeville: Okay. So I suppose my quick follow-up to that just really is, we were expecting to see far less than 93 basis points in Q4 based on Q3 comments. So just to be clear, so long as we don't receive any type of material tailwind from fuel, which we are very unlikely to receive in Q1, there should be some sequential improvement in your gross margin degradation, correct? J. Schlotman: Correct. Chris  Mandeville: And then my follow-up would be, just I've spent quite a bit of time in Vegas these last couple of days at Shop Talk. We've been speaking to a lot of folks within micro fulfillment. So Rodney, I guess, I just want to get your take here again as it relates to the relationship with Ocado. Can you help us think about a few items here and just why you think this is the right technology going forward? Have you spoken to them with respect to their own micro fulfillment option -- called Zoom? And then maybe does that actually afford you some flexibility with respect to the 20 CFCs that you dedicated yourself to with them? W. McMullen: In terms of -- first of all, somebody on the Ocado team and the Kroger team would -- actually would be talking daily. Now if you look on a broader strategic conversation, those would be happening probably on the monthly type basis. The thing -- one of the reasons that we were incredibly excited about partnering with Ocado is Tim and his team continually push themselves. And what they have today, they'll continue to get better and they'll continue to give a look at different approaches and alternatives. And when we signed an agreement with Tim, one of the comments we made was that we're not signing it based on what you have today, we're signing it based on what we think you're going to have in 3 to 5 years because of the talent they have, their drive to keep getting better and some of the things they have on their drawing board. So I feel very comfortable that if there's a model out there that's more efficient and gives the customer what they want, the partnership with Ocado, we'll be able to discover that and we'll be there when it needs to be there as well. Operator : The next question comes from Scott Mushkin of Wolfe Research. Scott Mushkin : Mike, gosh, it's been years. So congratulations. I can't believe you're going to be not on the call. J. Schlotman: Yes. My 77th one, as I said. Scott Mushkin : Yes. I don't think I've done 77, but I've done a few myself. So congratulations. J. Schlotman: Some days, it feels like you've done more than that, Scott. Scott Mushkin : So market share. You guys usually ran through market share in the fourth quarter, and I was just wondering if you can give us some thoughts on what's happened with the market share during the year. And then I wanted to follow-up. J. Schlotman: Yes. When you think about market share the way it's traditionally calculated, our market share did grow in the year. As Rodney talked about, our tonnage was actually better than what our ID sales were. And as you invest in price and things like that, it can distort the top line, but you're moving -- you continue to grow tonnage. W. McMullen: But it did slightly improve for the year. Scott Mushkin : Market share? J. Schlotman: Yes. Scott Mushkin : And when you're talking tonnage when we look at the IDs, you're excluding about 50 basis points from specialty pharma contribution. Is that correct or no? J. Schlotman: Let me understand you. I don't understand your question exactly. Scott Mushkin : I thought you put specialty pharma into the comp. And I forget what quarter you did that -- it was the first quarter of last year and I was just wondering... J. Schlotman: Yes, we started at the beginning of the year. W. McMullen: Yes. On tonnage, what we tried to do is just look at the absolute number of units that's flowing through our stores. So a unit of toilet paper counts as 1 whether it's a 1 pack or a club pack size. But it's just looking at the units that are flowing through our stores is how we try to track it. Scott Mushkin : Perfect. And my follow-up question is, I know you guys have been working on alternative revenues for a while. So I assume in the '18 numbers there's a chunk of that EBIT that's alternative revenues. I was just wondering if you can size how big the year-over-year gain was and how big the alternative revenues are already. Gary Millerchip : Yes. I think as we mentioned a few minutes ago, we saw really nice growth in alternative profits year over year. The 2 biggest areas, as you know, from the analyst meeting, are media and Kroger Personal Finance. And both of those 2 grew profitability by over 20% during 2018. As I kind of referred to earlier, we're still really wanting to work through what's the best way to be able to give you the full picture around alternative profit going forward. It's becoming obviously a bigger and more meaningful part of our business. As Mike mentioned, Mike Schlotman mentioned earlier, with the fuel being a headwind in 2019, we expect both what you traditionally think of as the core business an alternative profits both to be contributing to the improvements in FIFO operating profit in 2019 with a headwind that we'll face in fuel. But at this point, we're really taking a step back and determining what's the best way to really share the alternative profit story in a meaningful way for all of you and to make sure that we can connect the dots for everybody. J. Schlotman: And if you remember back at the investor conference this year in '18, Stuart Aitken had a slide that showed the slope of the growth of alternative profit. Admittedly, it didn't have the dollars on it. But if you take a look at that slide, it shows how we expect it to continue to build over time. And as that momentum starts, you'll see even more growth out into the future. Operator : And next question will come from Greg Badishkanian of Citi. Gregory Badishkanian : Great. So just a follow-up on the food inflation. You had mentioned it was 39 basis points. So I'm just wondering how much -- how'd you expect that to trend in 2019? And also, just your ability to pass that amount or even maybe greater than that in terms of [ to the ] customer? J. Schlotman: Yes, our expectation for inflation in 2019 is relatively benign. And I would say the way it gets passed on depends a lot about where the inflation comes from. Is it in a category where we have a specific pricing program that we want to stay committed to. Or is it in a -- or in a category where it might be a little easier to pass on and others are passing on along -- passing it on along as well. So it really depends exactly where you wind up seeing the inflation, whether or not it gets passed along and how quickly it gets passed along. Gregory Badishkanian : Right. Makes sense. And then just with the -- a lot of discussion on the press -- in the press about Amazon opening up physical stores, how would you characterize the level of risk to larger conventional food retailers from that move? And what are kind of the things that are maybe embedded in terms of your competitive positioning and your footprint that would help to offset that? W. McMullen: Well, a couple of things. First of all, as you know, we embarked upon creating an omnichannel experience for our customers of almost 5 years ago now. And we're -- if you look at the feedback our customers give us, we're increasingly being able to help it -- help the customer make it easier for them to get they want. And what we find is when customers are engaged digitally, they still come into the physical store and they also spend more with us in total. So our teams have done a great job of being able to create that and make sure that we keep that customer connection and continuing to improve that customer connection. The thing that we've had for years is we have 460,000 associates out there that are just every day working hard to serve our customers and each other. The quality of our fresh product continues to get better and better and it's a competitive advantage. When you take all of those things together, and we have a lot of great physical locations that are high-quality sites that have been accumulated over several years. It's really all of those things together in terms of what will cause the customer to want to come from us, partner with us and for us to be able to give them an experience they can't get somewhere else. And very excited about where we are. And as Gary mentioned in the prepared remarks, from a digital standpoint, we would expect that to become a tailwind in 2019. Thanks, Greg, appreciate it.  As always, thank you for everyone's call. As I mentioned at the beginning, we understand and acknowledge that we have our work cut out for us, and the market showed it this morning. But I want to emphasize that we are incredibly confident about the future of Kroger, especially with Restock Kroger. One of the exciting things about our earnings call also is that many of our associates listen in to better understand and gain insight on our business. And of course, many of our associates are shareholders as well.  So as always, before we end today's call, I'd like to share a few comments directed toward them. As I mentioned earlier in our prepared remarks, Kroger believes in strengthening the communities where we do business, within our supply chain, across our communities and in our stores. And you don't have to look far to see how much that strength comes from women. This month, we're excited to recognize all the women across Kroger -- the Kroger enterprise, who work day in and day out to exemplify our purpose, to Feed the Human Spirit. Kroger employs more than 250,000 women who work in our stores, manufacturing and distribution plants and offices. A growing number of nearly 500 women-owned businesses here in the U.S. are Kroger suppliers. And through our commitment to source foods that are Fair Trade Certified as part of our Simple Truth product line, we are proud to support women-owned cooperatives and businesses internationally, including women-led tea farms in Rwanda. Kroger is proud to join in today's celebration of International Women's Day, and we are lighting up our headquarters building in Cincinnati tomorrow to celebrate. Thank you to all of our customers, associates and suppliers who make our business successful every year -- every day of every year. I also want to have one last thank you for Mike, 77 calls is a heck of a lot of calls. Mike has been a great friend and partner in this journey. And Gary, congratulations. I'm incredibly looking forward to working with you and for you to be able to build on the things that Mike has put in place in working with his team. So congratulations. That completes our call today. Thanks for joining. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Rebekah Manis, Director, Investor Relations. Please, go ahead. Rebekah Manis : Thank you, Gary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our first quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. W. McMullen: Thank you, Rebekah. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me to review Kroger's first quarter 2019 result is Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip. We started the conversation with you last quarter by acknowledging that we had our work cut out for us. We are energized by that challenge, and our team brought that energy to the first quarter. There are several examples in the first quarter results that reflect the discipline, focus and progress we are making on our transformation plan : Restock Kroger. All of this work starts with our customer-obsession focus. That is why we're building an omnichannel platform to serve customers with Anything, Anytime, Anywhere. That is why we're focused on redefining the experience grocery customers can expect to have in our stores and online, improved upon by existing -- exciting partnerships that create additional value. That said, while the second year of Restock Kroger is off to a solid start, we know we can do better when it comes to our identical sales results. To that end, it's important that I say right up front that by further intensifying our customer focus, Kroger's quarter-to-date identical sales are trending better than the first quarter and moving toward the guidance range.  One of our most powerful competitive advantages is also one of our best ongoing performers. Kroger's own brand products grew 3.3%, and unit share gained 66 basis points to reach 28.9% share in the quarter. The focus on shifting the mix to Simple Truth and premium brands, such as Private Selection, led to double-digit gains in the quarter in those brands. We know that our customers love Our Brands and that they are hungry for innovative new products that they can only get by coming to and shopping with Kroger. In our quest to put food first and serve as America's food authority, we are bringing new tastes, trends and experiences to our customers. In the first quarter, we introduced 219 fantastic Our Brands items. Our customers' favorite new items fall in line with the key food and flavor trends we predicted for 2019, including Private Selection pork belly bites, Private Selection artisan jerky and Kroger Deluxe Unicorn Swirl Ice Cream. New items delivered over $225 million in incremental sales during the first quarter.  Customer obsession is also why we're building a platform to serve customers anything they want, anytime they want, and anywhere they want. Our customers don't distinguish between an in-store and online experience. Rather, they typically have a food-related need or a problem to solve and want the easiest, most seamless solution. Our digital sales grew 42% in the first quarter. We also expanded our coverage area to reach 93% of our customers in the first quarter. This means 93% of the customers who shop Kroger in a brick-and-mortar store also can shop with us for pickup or delivery. By the end of this year, everyone in America will have the ability through our modalities to shop with Kroger, whether they decide to come into a store, use our pickup or delivery services or ship. Our efforts are positioning Kroger to be the leading omnichannel retailer in the food industry. Since 2014, we've gone from no digital sales dollars to a 2018 annual run rate of about $5 billion, which will trend toward a $9 billion digital sales run rate in the future. I called this out because while we are only in the middle of our transformation, it's important to frame up the magnitude of the progress that we have made.  2019 is another pivotal year for our Partner for Customer Value pillar and Restock Kroger. We continue to improve the customer experience in our stores and across our digital properties by partnering with industry innovators such as Home Chef, Microsoft, Ocado and Walgreens. All of these partners accelerate our ability to provide customers Anything, Anytime, Anywhere. Each partner shares our passion for exploring the nexus between technology and innovative customer experiences. We were excited to break ground last week in Ohio on America's first customer fulfillment center powered by Ocado. Kroger's partnership with Ocado will, for the first time, introduce transformative e-commerce fulfillment and logistics technology in America. This, in turn, means Kroger customers will get fresher food faster than ever before. We intend to open additional customer fulfillment facilities to create a seamless customer experience, replicating the model to serve everyone across America.  We are also making progress building out our alternative business for profitable growth. We've made several organizational structural changes to allow deeper concentration on our alternative profit stream while also maintaining our laser focus on delivering for our customers in the core business. Kroger is creating a virtuous cycle, built upon the rich collection of proprietary data generated from our customer traffic, to improve the customer experience, which then supports new margin-rich, asset-light businesses. We expect alternative profit streams to continue to grow and contribute an estimated incremental $100 million in net operating profit in 2019 and continue to accelerate into 2020. This will be generated primarily from the more mature alternative profit streams such as Kroger Personal Finance, our Media businesses and customer data insights. There are other initiatives within our alternative business portfolio that are in earlier stages of incubation. For example, we recently announced the formation of PearlRock Partners, a platform to identify, invest in and help grow the next generation of leading consumer product brands. Initiatives such as PearlRock Partners are expected to have a small impact during Restock Kroger and then contribute more meaningfully to our results after 2020. Following up on our commitment we made in March to our financial stakeholders, Gary will provide additional transparency about where alternative profits will flow through our financial statements during his remarks.  One of the challenges transforming a company is finding the right leaders at the right time to guide and coach people through complex and often difficult change. The underlying principle is to respect the company's past while creating the future. We've secured Kroger's continued success in the next chapter of retail by proactively managing several pivotable next-generation leadership successions, including the essential CFO and CIO roles. We've also focused several senior-most executive roles, most notably leaders of our new business development, including partnerships, and Kroger's alternative business portfolio to support the transformation of our growth model. Every leadership transition is deliberate, carefully managed and made in partnership with Kroger's Board of Directors. I'd like to again congratulate all of our new senior vice presidents and underscore my confidence in their ability to lead Kroger forward.  Another important area of leadership for Kroger is in the environmental, social and governance areas, which is a natural extension of our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste plan and is gaining recognition from a growing number of investors. As America's grocer, we are committed to setting the table for a sustainable future. A year ago, we took a deeper look on how plastic is affecting our communities and environment and became the first major U.S. retailer to announce the phaseout of single-use plastic grocery bags, starting with our QFC division in the Pacific Northwest. Earlier this month, Kroger announced our commitment to be the exclusive U.S. grocery retail partner for Loop. Loop is a new system that uses durable product packaging to help reduce single-use plastics. TerraCycle introduced Loop at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January to much fanfare and media interest. Many familiar suppliers and brands are included in the platform, and the list continues to expand. Loop hygienically cleans and sanitizes the empty packaging that was previously sold to the consumer and sends it back to the suppliers to refill for another use.  Because the retail industry is transforming, we proactively launched Restock Kroger to deliver for customers and our shareholders. Plainly stated, Restock Kroger is all about transforming our growth model. The second year of Restock Kroger is off to a solid start. The entire company is focused on redefining the grocery customer experience, improving upon our exciting partnerships that create value. We are investing in our associates more than ever before and building a purpose-driven culture, and we are also on track to generate the free cash flow and incremental adjusted FIFO operating profit targets for 2019. As I said earlier, we recognize we have work to do and remain focused on delivering on our Restock Kroger commitments.  Now I'd like to turn it over to Gary Millerchip, who's been in the CFO role since April. Gary? Gary Millerchip : Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results demonstrate the strength and diversity of Kroger's multifaceted business model. Overall, we are leveraging Kroger's unique assets, our scale, unmatched customer data insights and our knowledge of food to build even stronger connections with our customers across all modalities : in store, pickup, delivery and ship.  As Rodney discussed, we have a few headwinds during the first quarter, including sales, which we know must be stronger. We also experienced pharmacy gross margin pressure similar to others in the industry. Because of our multifaceted business model, we delivered an adjusted EPS result of $0.72 per diluted share. I'd like to highlight a few areas of our business that were particularly strong during the quarter. Our Brands contributed both as a sales driver and a profit leader. The entire Kroger team brought discipline to controlling costs during the first quarter and delivered on our Restock Kroger savings plan. And alternative profit businesses exceeded budget, setting us up to deliver our incremental operating profit target for 2019.  On that note, last quarter, we committed to providing you with greater transparency on our alternative businesses and their contribution to Restock Kroger. As Rodney said at the top of the call, we expect alternative profits to contribute an incremental $100 million in operating profit in 2019. You will see this growth reflected through the gross margin line of our financial statements.  Certain amounts that we've traditionally recognized as reductions to OG&A expenses and merchandising costs are now being reflected as sales. This treatment more appropriately reflects the nature of these items and is consistent with others in the industry. In the first quarter, this affected identical sales by 3 basis points, and we have provided more detail in our 8-K filing. Please refer to Table 8 for a deeper explanation on the reclassification.  Through the first quarter of 2019, alternative businesses are ahead of our expectations, with Media business and Kroger Personal Finance leading the way. We expect incremental operating profit growth to vary throughout the year, reflecting the continued acceleration of our Media business and the seasonality of certain businesses during peak holiday selling periods. For example, our gift card business is very seasonal, and therefore, growth will be most visible in respective quarters.  Kroger reported identical sales without fuel of 1.5% during the first quarter. The timing of SNAP disbursement negatively affected results by 15 basis points. Several departments outperformed the company in the quarter, including key beverage categories, pet, natural foods, and we had another strong quarter from our pharmacy business. We recognize that getting into our identical sales guidance range will require an acceleration of identical sales throughout the rest of our fiscal year. We are diligently working to improve performance and build on the positive identical sales trend momentum we are seeing thus far in our second quarter. Additionally, as we move through the second quarter, we will begin to cycle investments made during the same period last year, which we expect to be a tailwind. Adjusted FIFO operating profit for the first quarter was $957 million and in line with our expectations for the quarter. Gross margin was 22.2% of sales for the first quarter, and FIFO gross margin, excluding fuel, decreased 40 basis points from the same period last year, primarily due to industry-wide lower gross margin rates in pharmacy. This represents a sequential improvement in the level of margin investments compared to the second half of 2018. The LIFO charge for the quarter was $15 million. Our associates have done an amazing job managing shrink, which improved during the first quarter compared to the prior year. This represents the seventh consecutive quarter of shrink rate improvement. OG&A cost as a rate of sales, excluding fuel and 2019 and 2018 first quarter adjustment items, decreased 12 basis points. This quarter's decrease is primarily due to the execution of Restock Kroger initiatives and planned real estate transactions. And by planned, I mean these transactions were contemplated in our EPS guidance for the year. Our results highlight the continued progress we are making with the Restock Kroger savings program, building on the $1.1 billion of savings and benefits achieved in our prior fiscal year. We are committed to continuing to find additional improvements and efficiencies in our business. Retail fuel profit growth was in line with our expectations for the quarter, but we still expect fuel operating profit to be a headwind overall in 2019, particularly in the second half of the year. Our cents-per-gallon fuel margin in the first quarter was $0.23 compared to $0.18 in the same quarter last year. The average retail price of fuel was $2.62 versus $2.63 in the same quarter last year. Fuel is an important part of our strategy to drive customer engagement, especially among our most loyal households. We continue to increase our investment in fuel rewards and saw positive gallon growth with our loyal customers in the first quarter. Turning now to talent development. We are supporting associates in a variety of ways, including investments in wages, training and development. We continue to invest in our associates as part of Restock Kroger. Today, I'm pleased to share our recently updated average hourly rate is over $20 per hour with comprehensive benefits factored in, benefits that many of our competitors don't offer. The most recent example of our investments in wages was our Monday announcement of a newly ratified labor contract covering store associates in Indianapolis. The ratified agreement with UFCW Local 700 raises starting wages for most clerks, and associates will receive regular wage increases every 6 months. This is part of our continued effort to rebalance pay and benefits while also focusing on certifications and performance incentives, career opportunities and training.  We are also very energized by the significant interest we're seeing from associates in Feed Your Future, our industry-leading education assistance program launched just over a year ago. Feed Your Future is available to all associates, full or part-time, after 6 months of service. Among all the participants, more than 80% are hourly store associates. As a result of our investments in talent development, we are significantly improving employee retention in one of the tightest labor markets in years. In addition to the new labor agreement covering Kroger associates in Indianapolis, we also ratified a new labor agreement with the UFCW covering King Soopers associates in Denver and Kroger associates in Louisville, Kentucky, during the first quarter. We are currently negotiating with UFCW for contracts covering store associates in Las Vegas, Memphis, Portland, Seattle and Southern California. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good-quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We continue to strive to make our overall benefits package relevant to today's associates. Our financial results continue to be pressured by inefficient health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and international unions which represent many of our associates on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.  A key component of Restock Kroger is generating strong free cash flow. Our financial strategy is to use free cash flow to drive growth while also maintaining our current investment-grade debt rating and returning capital to shareholders. We actively balance the use of cash to achieve these goals. We reduced net total debt by $1.7 billion during -- since the end of fiscal year 2018. Kroger's net total debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio is 2.54, down from 2.83 at the end of 2018. The company's net total debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio target range is 2.3 to 2.5. We have prioritized getting our net total debt-to-EBITDA ratio back into the target range and use proceeds from the sale of YouTechnology and the Turkey Hill Dairy business to help us do so. I'd like to take a few moments to talk a little bit more about YouTech. This is a great example of how Kroger leveraged the unique assets I mentioned earlier to create significant value for our shareholders. We acquired the business for a nominal value several years ago and developed it into a market leader in digital coupons. When the business reached a point where the potential value to someone else was higher than the future value to Kroger, we sold the business to maximize shareholder return. As part of the terms of the sale, we protected the value to Kroger through a long-term service agreement with Inmar. YouTech is a great illustration of how we are leveraging our unique assets to create new asset-light, margin-rich businesses to drive incremental value for our shareholders. Before I turn it back to Rodney, I'd like to discuss an accounting change that affects our financial reporting and reiterate our guidance for 2019. You may have noticed in our 8-K filing that we adopted the new leasing standard at the beginning of the fiscal year. This added nearly $7 billion of lease-related assets and liabilities to our balance sheet. The rating agencies already calculate and include our liability for operating leases in their ratings assessments, and this new standard is not expected to affect rent expense or earnings for the year. Finally, I would like to reiterate our guidance for the year. For 2019, identical sales growth, excluding fuel, we continue to target identical rates that range from 2% to 2.25%. We continue to expect adjusted net earnings to range from $2.15 to $2.25 per diluted share and adjusted FIFO operating profit to range from $2.9 billion to $3 billion for 2019. Kroger's EPS growth will come from adjusted FIFO operating profit growth in 2019, which positions us well to deliver on Restock Kroger. Rodney, back to you. W. McMullen: Thanks, Gary. We feel optimistic at the start of the second quarter. Sales momentum is building, and we are laser-focused on serving our customers. We are clear eyed about the challenges ahead and confident in our ability to deliver on our plans, both for the year and our long-term vision, to serve America through food inspiration and uplift. Now we look forward to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Robert Ohmes : Rodney, my question is could you talk a little bit about, now that you're 1/4 into this year, how your price investment plan is trending? Is it more or less than what you were expecting? And maybe remind us what kind of price investment year 2019 is expected to be and maybe weave that into how that plays out into the expectation for accelerating IDs, and then also maybe weave in just the environment you're seeing out there competitively. We're seeing signs of the promotional environment in produce being a little more aggressive than it's been in a while. If you could weave the picture together for us, that would be great. W. McMullen: Thanks, Robby. If you look at price investments overall, we're tracking really pretty consistent with where we expected it to be. We are continuing to cycle the investments we made during last year, so the flow-through of that will continue to be helpful. If you look at the '19 investments, it would be a reasonable amount. It will not be as much as what we did in '18 because, as you recall, when we had the tax law changes, we accelerated some of our '19 investments into '18 to give customers some of the value from the lower tax rate. When you look at the environment overall, there's always puts and takes. And overall, we would say it's pretty consistent with where it was before. We'll always see a specific area or category get more. But when you look it all in all, it looks pretty consistent with before. On accelerating the identicals, it really is -- one of the things on space optimization, now it's becoming a tailwind versus a headwind. Obviously, that's been -- has taken us longer than we expected, so that's been a positive. Just in terms of basic execution in the stores, our teams are doing a great job of improving the customer experience, which is adding momentum as well. And it's making sure that we use our data to target the right things to work on. So it's all of those things coming together and then being a little bit better at telling the customer our story. Operator : The next question comes from Judah Frommer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Judah Frommer : Maybe, first, just a follow-up on IDs. Can you help us with the cadence throughout the quarter? It sounded like when you gave the quarter-to-date update with fourth quarter earnings that you were running better than where you finished the quarter, and obviously things are expected to accelerate. So beyond remodels, has there been enough contribution from the rollout of online grocery and the impact of inflation relative to your expectations? W. McMullen: Inflation was higher in the first quarter than before but pretty consistent with expectations. When you look at the first quarter overall, sales were moving up nicely and continuing to make -- tracking as expected and making great progress up through Easter. Right after Easter, we hit a wall, and I always hate to use weather as an excuse for anything. But there's no doubt that when you look at the weather categories, we saw quite a bit of impact just because of -- if you look at Mother's Day, the things around Mother's Day and grilling out and all those things. As I mentioned, SNAP was a slight headwind but not a huge amount. When you look at it in total for the quarter, we continue to have great growth in loyal household growth. And if you look at spend per item, we saw people continuing to move upscale and continue to purchase bigger packs. And as I mentioned earlier, when we're looking at the second quarter so far, it's only 3 weeks, but we are moving closer to the '19 guidance. Gary Millerchip : Rodney, the only thing I would add... Judah Frommer : Okay. Great. And then... Gary Millerchip : So I think the question was asked around digital, too, as part of the overall performance, and we continue to see strong results, and certainly in line with what we expected during the first quarter from the way customers are engaging through the seamless digital experience that we're creating, both in terms of ordering online to pick up at the store and also ordering online to ship to home or deliver to home. Judah Frommer : Okay. And if I could quickly follow up on Media. It sounds like trends are going kind of in line with or above plan there. Clearly, some of your big-box competitors have made moves in the media space, sometimes acquiring external assets. Is that something you feel like you need to do? Does their leaning into these retailer-led platforms help your conversations with vendors? Or does it serve as more competition? W. McMullen: Yes. For us, we view it as additional partners helping CPGs to help them better spend their money. And when we really look at it, we're able to help CPGs to understand -- and you remember the old adage that half of my media is wasted, I just don't know which half. And our teams are able to do a great job on being able to help media companies understand where you spend money and what's the behavior of the customer. And we view the market as big enough to where there's plenty of opportunity for the market to grow overall and for the other companies that you referenced, for all of us to be successful, just because it's such a large market. So when we look at the opportunity, it's incredibly exciting. I know some of the early partners are really happy with the results, and we're just getting started. In terms of acquiring somebody, so far we've been able to partner with world-class companies to really accelerate our journey. Now whether that changes over time, I think it's to be determined. Operator : The next question comes from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Edward Kelly : Yes. Just, first, a clarification. The planned real estate transaction in the quarter, if I look at the cash flow statement, there is about a $57 million gain. Is that the amount that we should be thinking about that contributed to the quarter? Gary Millerchip : Jeff, it's Gary. That's right, Ed. We -- as we mentioned in the prepared notes, we actually had this transaction planned as part of the guidance for the year and part of our business plan. I think you're aware, but real estate has always been part of our overall strategy as to how do we make the best use and leverage the assets that we have available to us and that we're creating as we build out a store around a shopping center and as we start to really make the most of being that anchor tenant in many of the places that we operate. So for many years, we've had real estate transactions in our results. Often, they can be some losses as well as gains sometimes during those quarters. We felt that this quarter, because it was a bigger amount than it would normally be, it was important that we were transparent, especially as obviously it helped the OG&A rate to look better overall in the quarter because of that onetime transaction. But it was absolutely contemplated, and it was part of our expectations actually in the first quarter as well. Edward Kelly : Any other planned real estate transactions like this contemplated for the full year? Gary Millerchip : I think we are always obviously looking at opportunities and especially where it can help our free cash flow and where we can arbitrage the profitability of the real estate that we own currently. So I wouldn't get into specific details around any of the overall plans that we have, but we do certainly look for those opportunities where they exist, but they're not contemplated within the guidance that we shared. W. McMullen: And, Ed, this is Rodney. If it was anything material, we would share it as well so that everybody would know. And as Gary mentioned, it's in the guidance. Edward Kelly : Rodney, my real question here is for you, and it's on the IDs. And bigger picture, you used to consistently outperform a broader peer set and industry data like Nielsen. And to me, one of the biggest issues right now with your company is that, that actually no longer seems to be happening. And your IDs are just north of 1% this quarter despite the fact that you have digital in there, specialty's in there now. You are lapping some optimization. You've invested a lot last year. I guess why do you think the share gains have slowed so much? And I know you're focused on improving momentum, but what specific adjustments are you making? W. McMullen: It really is, for us, to step up our game. And if you look at the customer experience, we've made significant improvement in some of the basic customer experience. What we find is there's a lag between when you make those improvements and when the customer starts rewarding you with their checkbook. And so part of the -- and this is using the data that we track every week, how are we doing in terms of the friendliness of our associates, in-stock and all of those pieces. And the progress that we've made is stronger than our progress in our identicals. The other part is some of the things I mentioned before, is just cycling space optimization and the other projects and getting a return from the remodels that we're doing and using the data in a continued, sophisticated way but even growing upon that as what we've had in the past. Operator : The next question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Erica Eiler : This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. So I actually wanted to touch on food inflation. Can you maybe get a little bit more granular in terms of what you're seeing currently and your expectations going forward? And then maybe you could talk about, are you seeing prices being passed through to the shelf at this point? Gary Millerchip : Sure. I'd be happy to talk about that. So as you know, when we talked about our guidance for the year, our expectation was that we'd see inflation in the range of 0% to 1%. That was what we've built our plan around. And I would say if you look at Q1 results and exclude pharmacy and fuel from the calculation, we would be at the top end of that range. Certainly, as we are seeing those cost increases come through, we have a very robust process within our cost of goods team to really look at ways in which we can mitigate those cost increases and ensure that we're able to maintain profitability in the business. Where we are seeing the legitimate reason for those costs coming through, we are generally being successful in passing them on to the customer through the pricing strategy. And I would say that's generally what we saw during the first quarter and would be our strategy during the rest of the year. One of the things that obviously we feel is an important advantage for us is the significant market share that we have with our own brand products, and so ensuring that we're using that to really manage and balance as we see price increases come through. And of course, it's a great set of knowledge for us knowing what the true cost of product is and how to effectively manage those cost increases. Erica Eiler : Okay. That's helpful. And then... Gary Millerchip : I think our outlook... Erica Eiler : Oh, no, keep going. Gary Millerchip : No. I was just going to say I think our outlook for the year, in general, would be in the -- would be similar to what we've been experiencing, except for, of course, some of the challenges and uncertainties that are being created by some discussion on some potential trade impacts and obviously some things like the swine flu that was also out there. So there are obviously 1 or 2 items that we're watching very closely because they have the potential to impact inflation in a more meaningful way. W. McMullen: And tariffs from China has pretty minimal effect on us, and a lot of it can be managed. Tariffs from Mexico would be harder to manage. Hopefully, something works out there. As you know, overall, from a philosophy standpoint, we always believe that at the end of the day, tariffs just cause costs to go up for customers. Erica Eiler : Okay. No. That's great additional color. And then just quickly on gross margins. Can you talk about the dynamics going on with pharmacy right now and the industry as it relates to gross margin and how you're thinking about kind of those dynamics going forward? Gary Millerchip : Sure. First of all, I'd like to just maybe give a little bit more context on our pharmacy business, too, because it's certainly a very important part of our business. It drives a lot of loyalty overall with the customer, and we continue to get extremely strong customer satisfaction ratings. It's a part of our business that generally is continuing to grow script counts and grow sales very strongly, as we mentioned, during the quarter. And it ties very closely for us to our health and wellness strategy. And as we start to think about food as medicine, we think it's a very important connection. The business today is profitable for us and generates a high ROIC. But as you mentioned, we are certainly seeing some pressure in the industry. There's a couple of things at play, really, within the gross margin pressure that we saw in Q1 which, as I mentioned, wouldn't be unique to us. The first is there is a generic supply challenge, and therefore the cost of supplying product has gone up significantly. And secondly, as we've renegotiated our PPM agreements, 3 of the big ones going through the renegotiation process, there's an increase in costs there that's also placing some pressure on gross margin. That being said, our pharmacy team has been extremely proactive in developing plans to mitigate that, both from how do we buy most effectively but also how do we create more efficiency in the pharmacy business. And we continue to see significant efficiency improvements in the cost to fill a pharmacy order, and our pharmacy team are doing a really nice job of finding ways to offset some of those pressures. W. McMullen: And as I mentioned before, it's also the nice thing about having a multifaceted business where other things, the growth in our Own Brands and other things that I mentioned, in total, we still had great results. And also, as we look -- move forward, we see health and wellness as a huge opportunity in terms of from an alternative business standpoint and creating new partnerships to be able to help America live a healthier life. And as Gary mentioned, everything that we see, discussions with a lot of different health care providers, we increasingly see food as medicine. And if you look at our OptUP app and some of those things, we're able to help people eat healthier, and we see that as an opportunity even bigger in the future than it's been in the past. Operator : The next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : Rodney, can you address the topic of the organization's capacity for change, right? So you've got a lot of change going on. You've got people in new roles. Do you think that, all of that, other than maybe space optimization, is impacting execution in any way and maybe impacting your top line growth? And then as you go forward, if there might be some of that, is there a way to sort of streamline things, prioritize so that maybe there's -- you impact the organization's ability to manage that change better? Curious to your thoughts on that. W. McMullen: Yes. A great question, John, and it's something that we talk about, obviously, routinely. It was one of the reasons that we made some of the organizational changes that we made and moving alternative business to its own stand-alone area because we wanted to make sure that we had -- it's a huge opportunity -- we had dedicated people focused on it, and we didn't have people that were responsible for the daily interaction with the customer trying to do both. And one of the things I always like to --  for us to ask ourselves is, is it center of plate or corner of plate, [ corner of that ]? And if it's center, that's incredibly important. So I feel incredibly good about the people that we've put in place and making sure that the clarity is separating from all the pieces. We have recruited some external talent over the last several months to help us supplement the internal talent that we already had in terms of some of our operating areas, some of our vice presidents. And on our digital team, we've recruited a ton of talent from the outside to accelerate our digital journey. So it's -- to me, I think it's a great question. We spend a lot of energy on it. When you look at the operating side of the business, we have a lot of new people in role over the last couple of years. It always takes a little while for new talent to hit their stride, and I feel really good about how they're growing and the progress we're starting to make on the customer connection attributes. And it's starting to show up in loyal customer growth, so it's making progress. We feel really good about the talent we have in place, and we're starting to make some accelerated progress. John Heinbockel : And then I know it's early, but what have you learned with the Walgreen test in Cincinnati, particularly as you kind of look forward to opening up the Ocado sheds in non-Kroger markets? Have you learned anything definitive or not yet? W. McMullen: Yes. It's still very, very early, and I would say the thing that has been incredibly positive is Walgreens, their team and their store teams are a fantastic partner. And both of us are learning things, the customer likes and dislikes, together, and we really see it as something that we continue to understand the customer desires and changes and adapting to that. And it's pretty early on. I know, Gary, you're much closer to it from a day-to-day basis, so I'll let you add some of the specific color. Gary Millerchip : Yes. Sure. I think that some of the things that we're learning and we like so far, John, with what we're seeing, first of all, by having the level of convenience now that we have with those 13 stores in Northern Kentucky, alongside 10 of our own stores with the pickup service, we're getting great feedback on both the fact that we're even a different level of convenience than we were before. And this ability to get in and out really quickly is certainly something that is resonating very well with the customers that are using the service. We're also starting to see some positive feedback from customers around the speed of in and out for those small shopping trips and the ability to be able to get what I need for today and what I need for tonight, whether it's for lunch or dinner, and that's certainly a real positive. What we find generally with the small-format stores, there is a ramp-up as customers become more comfortable with their shopping behavior. We've seen that with our own small-format stores, and we've seen it over the years with convenience stores. So the biggest thing for us now is really poring over the data and making sure that we're using a data-driven approach to continue to enhance the service and the experience. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Can you give us more clarity on how the past year -- full year operating profit guidance works? Thus far, you're trending a little bit below your ID sales range, even currently in the quarter. Sounds like the pharmacy gross margin pressure has been greater than you expected, and you got a real estate gain in the first quarter and yet your profits were still down. So what's the path that you can take from here to get to your operating profit guidance for the full year? And at what point do you see more risk that it would be harder to get to that level? W. McMullen: Yes. I'll make a couple of comments, and then I'll let Gary fill in on the details. Some of the -- if you look at the positives, we had great expense control. The other thing I think is always important to remember is we sold the Turkey Hill Dairy business. We sold the c-store business during the first quarter, and we sold YouTech, all of which affected operating profit when you look at year-on-year in the first quarter. So I think it's important to remember that as well. And as I mentioned, the alternative profit exceeded expectations in the first quarter as well. With that, Gary, I'll let you fill in more of the details. Gary Millerchip : Yes. I think that's a very important point you made around the adjustments to get the year-over-year comparison correct, Rodney, so thank you for raising those. I think beyond what you already shared, the key components I would add, we are obviously excited about where alternative profit is heading and still see that as a potential upside. I think the other piece that I mentioned in the prepared comments is our team has done a phenomenal job of looking for how do we continue to generate cost savings and efficiency in the business, and we still believe there are more levers that we are pulling and we'll continue to pull that give us the ability to make sure that we continue to strengthen the financial model as we're continuing to drive the sales momentum that Rodney described in his opening comments as well. So for us, I think it is really about making sure that we're connecting more strongly with the customer and driving sales, but certainly very focused on how do we make sure we're creating the most efficient operating model. And we continue to find additional opportunities, whether it's in store productivity, pharmacy productivity, as I mentioned earlier. We still think there's a lot of upside in goods not for resale and cost of goods. And so as we continue on this journey to make sure we're building the most efficient retail operation, we do believe there are levers that we can continue to pull throughout the year and into 2020. Michael Lasser : And then my follow-up question is on your price investment. Recognizing that there's been a lot of noise in your IDs over the last couple of quarters given the disruption from the store remodels, do you think your price investments are as effective as they might have been in the past? And if they are, will you have to reaccelerate your price investments in the coming quarters to drive higher IDs this year? W. McMullen: Yes. The -- one of the things that we always think is very important to remember is customers decide where to shop based on things more than just price, and we feel very good about where our price is relative to the market and relative to our competitors. And remember, customers also look at regional players when they're looking at their price as well. When you look at overall, the customer decides where to shop based on what's the experience they get from associates, what's the freshness of the fresh departments, and we've continued to rate strong in terms of -- if you look at produce, meat, seafood, delis, those areas of our business and the experience in terms of a great checkout experience and speed. And when you look at rewards, we do a fantastic job with rewards that are exclusive to each individual customer, where we use our data to make targeted offers based on that particular customer. And then, obviously, fuel is an important part of that overall equation. So the customer decides where to shop based on the overall experience, and we feel great, and we continue to make progress when you look at that total experience. And if you look at -- as I mentioned before, we had solid growth, strong growth in our loyal shoppers. Operator : The next question comes from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Kelly Bania : I had a couple of questions on operating profit. First, wanted to ask just about your 3-year plan. I didn't really see anything specific in the release about it, and I don't want to read too much into it. But can you comment on your thoughts on that $400 million plan? As you've pointed out in the past, I think The Street is skeptical of getting to that given the huge acceleration it implies next year. But maybe just could you comment on that? And then on your other comments about Turkey Hill and there's a lot of moving pieces between the Turkey Hill divestiture, the Home Chef acquisition and now with this real estate transaction. That was $57 million, I think. So that's about 14% of the $400 million plan that we weren't aware of. So can you help us understand these moving pieces, how much they add or subtract to that operating profit plan, so we can kind of model this out a little bit more clearly? Gary Millerchip : Sure. Yes. I think as you think about the Restock Kroger Plan, as you know, when we built the plan out, we've identified $4.45 billion of overall savings and value that we expected to create and then would invest $4.05 billion to support the business growth, whether that was in our associates or in pricing or the customer experience and digital capabilities. I would say as we look at where we are in the journey, we're feeling very good about the -- what we've learned through the process around where we unlock and how we create that $4.45 billion of value. As you've heard us talk about, alternative profit streams are right where we expected them to be, if anything, slightly ahead of plan at this point, and we see continued great upside for growth there. As we look at the cost savings, we obviously were successful in exceeding our plan last year at $1.1 billion of cost savings, and we are identifying, I would say, more cost savings as we are working through the plan this year that we believe can continue to accelerate our progress there in becoming a more efficient operator. I do think, as we've shared all the way along and Rodney has been consistent in his comments, that we do have to make sure that we are continuing to build momentum in sales. That's an important part in generating more leverage through the growth in sales that we're committed to achieve in the second half of this year and obviously into 2020. So I think as you pull those 3 pieces together, we still feel we have a very clear path to get there. And I would say in the levers that we intended to pull, where we are in the journey with those levers, we're feeling very confident around them. And as we continue to build momentum in the sales line that Rodney referenced, we're still committed to the $400 million of incremental FIFO operating profit. Kelly Bania : And any comment on the Home Chef, Turkey Hill, the real estate, how those are part of the $400 million, the exact impact of those? Gary Millerchip : Yes. The -- so we will probably do a little bit of calculation to make sure we're baselined in the right place against where the starting point was. So we were at $3.1 billion, if you recall, in '17, going to $3.5 billion. There maybe a couple of -- they're certainly not going to be drastically material in the impact they would have on the baseline, but there certainly will be a need for us to clarify what the baseline would be with the various changes that happened and what that then means to what $400 million means incrementally by 2020. We certainly don't contemplate, as we think about the run rate and the value that we'll be generating in 2020, that one-off transactions would be a major driver of the value that we expect to create. We've built the Restock Kroger plan with the mindset that it builds momentum into beyond 2020. We're not focused on getting to a specific number for 2020 that doesn't drive the value. The Home Chef certainly isn't in the $400 million, and the Turkey Hill sale gains certainly is included in there. So none of these one-off transactions are, that's why we've kind of stripped those out from the performance and what we've shared as our progress in the year. None of those, or in 2020 would we expect there to be individual asset sales or disposals that are going to create a gain that would be, if you like, filling the gap between where we are today and where we expect to be in 2020. Kelly Bania : Okay. Maybe just a couple of follow-ups to that. I guess can you share with us where you see your FIFO operating profit with all the adjustments these, I guess, 5 quarters through the plan? And then in terms of alternative profit. So I think you said in the past, there was a 20% increase this year. Does that equate to the $100 million that you're now talking about? And can you remind us what the last year and next year is kind of planned at? W. McMullen: Well, on alternative profit in the quarter, the growth was -- last year, was 20%. This quarter would have been a little bit above 20%. And if you go back and look at '17, if I remember right, Gary, and you'll remember better than I would, I think it was 13% or so. So it's... Gary Millerchip : Yes. W. McMullen: It's continuing to accelerate as we learn what to -- how to do it. And if you look at like the Media business, we've recruited professionals that know how to grow that business, so we're actually accelerating where we are. On the 5 quarters and stuff, I think we're probably -- would be better off for Gary and Rebekah to follow up to make sure that we get the specifics of the question so that we can help -- be a little bit more helpful than on the fly. Gary Millerchip : Absolutely. Operator : The next question comes from Chris Prykull with Goldman Sachs. Christopher Prykull : So I guess, firstly, on the composition of gross margin, the change year-over-year and maybe the cadence for the rest of the year, a couple of components to that. So how much of the 40 basis point nonfuel decline can be attributed to pharmacy? Should we expect a similar headwind for the rest of the year? Will that improve? You mentioned alternative profits can be lumpy. Anything to keep in mind from a margin contribution seasonally? And then you're lapping some supply chain investments in the fourth quarter. I understand that. Any sense for mix shift towards Our Brands and the contribution there? W. McMullen: On the -- I'll start, and I'll let Gary finish. On the supply chain investments, in the first quarter, we continue to have significant start-up costs with facilities in Las Vegas, Michigan and Northern Kentucky that serves our online business. And the investment in the first quarter for those facilities was pretty similar to the fourth quarter in terms of an investment. Obviously, those facilities are in the middle of their ramp-up. If you look at Our Brands, as I always tell people, Our Brands margin typically is 600 to 800 basis points higher than national brand. Obviously, it's a higher sales part. And when you look at the gross margin per item, it's usually $0.01 or $0.02 higher on a cents-per-item profit basis. In terms of Rx and the balance of the year, Gary, I'll let you go into a little bit of the details there. Gary Millerchip : Yes. So certainly, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, a meaningful part of the gross margin decline in the quarter was the gross margin pharmacy pressure you mentioned and also Kroger Specialty Pharmacy with its continued growth. Those 2, combined, would have been a meaningful portion of the reduction. We're feeling really good about the fact that we saw a significant deceleration in gross margin decline in Q1 versus the second half of the year. And as we guided to for the whole year, we do expect that to be the case. We don't expect to have another quarter like we had in Q3 and Q4 last year. That being said, obviously, we manage the business very dynamically. It's important that we're able to adapt on pricing, continue to invest where it makes sense and where the customer tell us they really value it, and it will drive retention and growth in our loyal customer base. So we tend to really focus on how we're managing the business to make sure that we're achieving the overall operating profit guidance and EPS that we shared. We do think there will continue to be some pressure in the Rx margin as the year progresses on. As I mentioned earlier, the team there is doing a very good job in making sure that we're finding ways to manage that pressure and also introduce cost-saving initiatives that balance out the impact of that. So we certainly would expect the impact to be less in the rest of the year as the team continues to execute on a plan to drive strong sales growth and drive improvements in overall profitability. W. McMullen: And alternative profit is always strongest in the fourth quarter because of the gift cards and the other related items. We have time for one more question. Operator : And that question will come from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. And Mr. Cerankosky dropped out -- dropped his line. The next question will be from Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Michael Montani : Just on the core gross margins for the grocery and consumable business, can you talk about what you saw after you back out some of the supply chain investments in the pharmacy? What are you seeing in the core there? And then the follow-up is on tonnage. Did you have growth there in the quarter given the 1% inflation, 1.5% comp? Just give us some color there incrementally on the trend, if you could. W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at the tonnage on the equivalized units, it would have been continued growth. We continue to see customers going to buying bigger packs across the whole category. When you look at core gross margin, it would be a little bit of investment. But the -- as Gary mentioned, we had continued meaningful improvement in cost of goods through negotiation and other things, which funded quite a bit of investment as well. I don't know, Gary, anything you want to add to that? Gary Millerchip : No. I think you said it well, Rodney. W. McMullen: Okay. Good. Thanks, Michael. Before we end today's call, one of the things that's exciting about our earnings call is that many of our associates listen in to better understand and gain insights into our business. And of course, many of our associates are shareholders as well. So as always, before we end today's call, I'd like to share a few final comments directed to our associates and how all of us live our purpose every day. As America's grocer, Kroger takes seriously our role in celebrating our uniquely American heritage during the patriotic season between Memorial Day and Independence Day. It always makes me feel incredibly proud that Kroger employs so many men and women who have served or currently serve in the Armed Forces. I got a chance to personally live our purpose last Saturday with our Veterans Associate Resource Group who put on a 5K run to raise money for veterans. While I certainly didn't finish first and nowhere close to last either, I would like to add, in the race, I did have a different kind of first : touring a specifically designed tiny house that our caring associates dreamed up and then built for a deserving local veteran and his family. The home was built to green technology standards, made from recycled materials and features solar panels, demonstrating our associates' commitment to and passion for Kroger's Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social impact plan. In addition to the home, our Cincinnati/Dayton division donated a Kroger gift card and a bag of Our Brands products to turn a new tiny house into a home, and it really felt great. One of the many ways Kroger shows our gratitude and appreciation to all of our service members and their family is through our long-standing commitment to the USO. Kroger is the single-largest donor to the USO, contributing over $22 million over the past decade. In keeping with this commitment, we will be presenting the USO with $1 million donation and a Barbecue for the Troops event we are hosting at Fort Stewart in July. It is our honor and privilege as America's grocer to serve America's heroes. Thank you to all of our customers, associates and suppliers who make our business successful every day of the year. That completes our call today. Thanks for joining. Operator : The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Rebekah Manis, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Rebekah Manis : Thank you, Gary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, but Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our second quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] In addition, please save the date for our 2019 investor conference, which will be held in New York City on November 5. Further details will be shared soon, and we hope you can join us.  I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. W. McMullen: Thank you, Rebekah. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me today to review Kroger's second quarter 2019 results is Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip.  Kroger is focused on executing the second year of our Restock Kroger plan to generate shareholder value by serving America through food inspiration and uplift. Restock Kroger has 4 main drivers : redefine the grocery customer experience, partner for customer value, develop talent and live our purpose. Combined, these drivers come together to create shareholder value.  We are halfway through the second year of our 3-year plan. We continue making strategic investments to reposition the company for the future while continuing to grow and deliver today. We started this conversation the last 2 quarters by acknowledging we had our work cut out for us. As always, we remain energized by that challenge. While we're always continually driving for improvement, there are several examples in our second quarter results that reflect the disciplined focus of Restock Kroger blueprint is paying off.  Guided by our customer obsession, Kroger delivered our best identical sales results since the launch of our transformational plan. Our internal customer measures are improving even faster than our identical sales growth. There is always a lag between improving the customer experience and when the customer will reward us. Some other positive trends during the second quarter include FIFO operating margin that was stable in our supermarket business, excluding fuel and pharmacy. 15 of our divisions had increasingly -- increasing supermarket identical sales without fuel compared to the first quarter.  We continue to reduce costs. We are on track to deliver $100 million in incremental operating profit through alternative profit stream growth.  We continue to make significant investments to redefine the grocery customer experience. We are building a platform of seamless experiences to serve customers anything they want, anytime they want, anywhere they want. We know the seamless experience is essential to the customer experience, both today and tomorrow, which is why we continue to invest heavily in our capabilities in this area.  Kroger's digital sales grew by a solid 31% in the second quarter. Pickup and delivery sales growth continued to perform in the mid-30% during the quarter. Going forward, we expect our digital sales growth rate to moderate year-over-year primarily due to the cycling of Home Chef and as a result of our disciplined focus on growing the Ship customer of our other digital offerings like Vitacost. Vitacost remains an important part of our business, and our growth in Ship is in part thanks to what we've gained from their platform and talent.  We've also expanded our digital coverage area to reach 95% of our customers. This means that 95% of our customers who shop Kroger at a brick-and-mortar store can also shop with us for pickup or delivery. Importantly, we are starting to see improving operating profit trends in our digital business. Our digital business is becoming less of a headwind, which is an important inflection point, and we continue to invest in new capabilities to support our transition to seamless. However, I do want to note, this is still a significant investment for the company.  A great example of partnering for customer value is our continued rollout of Ocado sheds. In July, Kroger and Ocado announced plans for a new high-tech customer fulfillment center in Forest Park, Georgia. What's so exciting about Ocado is that their model to deliver to customers is significantly less costly than our existing model. So not only will sheds accelerate our ability to provide customers with a seamless experience, they will also help us to do it in a much more cost-effective way. We know Ocado's value is not just its current capabilities but also in how quickly the company is able to innovate to serve a rapidly developing online consumer market. Ocado's technology team of over 1,400 software engineers brings a huge depth of talent and a long track record of innovation to growing opportunities in online grocery retail.  We also announced an expansion of our relationship with Walgreens to a new test area in Knoxville, Tennessee. Starting this fall, 35 Walgreens stores in the area will feature a curated selection of Kroger's popular Our Brands products like Simple Truth, America's largest natural organic brand, along with national brand products.  Kroger's Our Brand sales grew 3.1% this quarter. Retail and unit share growth led to the highest second quarter share in Our Brands' history. We also introduced 203 new Our Brand items during the second quarter. Our customers' favorite new items near key food and flavor trends we predicted and then shared with our investor community last year at Investor Day. And those new items delivered more than $137 million in incremental sales during the second quarter, further bolstering our supermarket business. We were thrilled to share the news last week that Kroger is leading the way with the widest assortment of plant-based protein among U.S. retailers through our Simple Truth brand.  We continue to see progress in alternative profit streams with Media and Kroger Personal Finance as the primary growth drivers. Gary will share additional commentary on the progress of our alternative profit streams in his section.  Now moving to talent development. As we previously shared, we are proud that our average hourly rate is over $20 per hour with comprehensive benefits factored in, benefits that many of our competitors don't offer. As a result of Kroger's talent development investments, we are significantly improving employee retention in one of the tightest labor markets in years. We continue to invest in our associates as part of Restock Kroger by supporting associates in a variety of ways, including investment in wages, training and development.  Feed Your Future is our industry-leading education assistance program continues to build momentum. Among all the participants, more than 85% are hourly store associates. Since inception of the program last year, we've distributed 3,000 awards totaling $5.1 million in education assistance. In addition to continuing to develop talent internally, we continue to recruit talent from the outside, especially in the areas of digital, technology and supermarkets. Increasingly, customers, associates, stakeholders and U.S. investors are choosing who to partner with based on a purpose and values. We were pleased to see the business roundtable's recent announcement, acknowledging that businesses have a responsibility to be a positive influence on society. Kroger has always been focused on being a trusted partner in communities and committed to social purpose. In the second quarter, we were proud to publish our 2019 environmental, social and governance report, reflecting our efforts across the company to be environmentally responsible and a positive influence on society. The report detailed progress on Kroger's Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social impact plan as well as our 2020 sustainability goals.  Other items highlighted in the report included our 9% reduction in food waste generated by retail stores. We achieved a 13% improvement in supermarket food waste diverted from landfills, moving from 27% diversion in 2017 to 40% in 2018. We reduced the amount of plastic resin in Our Brands packaging by 9.1 million pounds so far, well on our way to achieving our 10 million pound goal by 2020. I will now turn it over to Gary for more detail into our quarterly financials. Gary? Gary Millerchip : Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Our second quarter results demonstrate our ability to deliver for shareholders while we reposition the company for the future through Restock Kroger. For the quarter, we delivered an adjusted EPS of $0.44 per diluted share. I'd like to highlight a few areas on our business that were particularly robust. Our Brands contributed as both a sales driver and a profit leader. The entire Kroger team brought discipline to controlling costs during the second quarter and delivered on our Restock Kroger savings plans. The alternative profit businesses achieved budget, setting us up to deliver our incremental operating profit target for 2019. And our fuel performance was strong, helping mitigate pharmacy gross margin, LIFO and tax headwinds in the quarter. LIFO charge for the quarter was $30 million compared to $12 million for the same period last year driven by a higher-than-expected inflation in dry grocery, pharmacy and dairy. Our adjusted corporate tax rate for the quarter was 23.9% compared to 18% in the same period last year. These 2 factors combined represented a $0.05 per diluted share headwind in the quarter compared to last year.  As Rodney mentioned, Kroger reported identical sales without fuel at 2.2% during the second quarter, marking our strongest quarter since we launched our transformation plan. Several departments outperformed the company in the quarter, including key beverage categories, produce and natural foods. We were also pleased with top line momentum in our pharmacy business and experienced mid-single-digit increase in script counts. Overall, we are pleased with sales progress in the quarter, and we will continue to work to build on this momentum in the second half of the year.  Adjusted FIFO operating profit for the second quarter was $626 million, an increase of 10.6% compared to the second quarter in 2018. Gross margin was 21.9% of sales for the second quarter. FIFO gross margin, excluding fuel, decreased 29 basis points from the same period last year primarily driven by industry-wide lower gross margin rates in pharmacy and continued growth in our specialty pharmacy business. Retail supermarkets, excluding fuel and retail pharmacy, saw 12 basis points of gross margin investment. Based on the needs of the business, we are focused on balancing margin investments and capturing cost of goods, sourcing savings and operational efficiencies to offset these investments. As a great example of this focus, our associates have done an impressive job managing shrink, which improved in the second quarter compared to last year. This represents the eighth consecutive quarter of year-over-year shrink rate improvement.  OG&A cost as a rate of sales, excluding fuel and adjustment items, decreased 14 basis points. This was achieved through continued focus on execution of Restock Kroger initiatives that drive administrative efficiencies, store productivity and sourcing cost reductions. We always look for opportunities to improve free cash flow and ROIC, important metrics to Kroger shareholders. During the quarter, we accepted a substantial offer to sell an unused warehouse that had been on the market for some time. Kroger used the gain from this transaction as an opportunity to contribute a similar amount into the UFCW company pension plan, helping stabilize associates' future benefits. The net impact of these transactions to EPS growth was neutral.  As we have previously shared, fuel is an important part of our strategy to drive customer engagement, and our loyal customers continue to receive hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel rewards each year in the form of price discounts at the pump. The average retail price of fuel was $2.71 this quarter compared with $2.85 in the same quarter last year. Retail fuel profit came in above our expectations for the quarter. Our cents per gallon fuel margin in the second quarter was $0.35 compared to $0.26 in the same quarter last year. Fuel is a great example of Kroger sourcing teams continuing to improve buying practices. This allowed us to achieve improvement in fuel cost of goods in the second quarter. We now expect fuel to be less of a headwind in the second half of the year than originally anticipated.  Alternative profit streams are on track to contribute an incremental $100 million in operating profit in 2019. Media and Kroger Personal Finance will be the primary drivers of growth this year.  Kroger Precision Marketing continued to build momentum in the quarter, increasing engagement to over 300 consumer packaged goods companies and experienced a 90% retention rate along with significantly higher spend. Kroger Personal Finance also saw growth in line with expectations during the quarter as we successfully expanded the number of customers and the frequency with which customers utilize these products. And now for an update on labor relations. We ratified the new labor agreement with the UFCW covering associates in Fort Wayne, Indiana; Louisville, Kentucky; and Nashville, Tennessee, during the second quarter. We also reached a tentative agreement with the UFCW covering 17,000 associates in our Ralphs division in Southern California earlier this week. We are currently negotiating with the UFCW for contracts covering store associates in Las Vegas, Memphis, Portland and Seattle. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good-quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We continue to strive to make our overall benefit package relevant to today's associates.  Our financial results continue to be pressured by inefficient health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions, which represent many of our associates, on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.  Our financial strategy is to use our strong free cash flow to drive growth while also maintaining our current investment-grade debt rating and returning capital to shareholders. We actively balance the use of cash flow to achieve these goals. We committed to prioritize free cash flow to reduce the company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to within our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Over the last 12 months, net total debt has reduced by $1.3 billion, and Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 2.46 for the second quarter of 2019 compared to 2.59 a year ago. We remain committed to our target net total debt to adjusted EBITDA range, and as we start to operate consistently within that range, we will explore options for returning additional capital to shareholders. Earlier this year, Kroger increased the dividend by 14%, marking the 13th consecutive year of dividend increases.  Turning now to guidance for 2019. We continue to expect identical sales growth, excluding fuel, to range from 2% to 2.25% in 2019. We continue to expect adjusted net earnings to range from $2.15 to $2.25 per diluted share and adjusted FIFO operating profit to range from $2.9 billion to $3 billion for 2019. We are pleased with our second quarter progress and are maintaining full year guidance to 2019.  With pharmacy gross headwinds expected to continue in the second half of 2019 and as we lap a particularly strong OG&A performance in the third quarter of 2019 -- 2018, we now expect EPS to be flat in the third quarter of 2019. In the fourth quarter, we expect double-digit EPS growth as we lap discrete items from prior year and continue to build strong momentum with our alternative profit streams. I'll now turn it back to Rodney. W. McMullen: Thanks, Gary. As Rebekah said earlier, our Annual Kroger Investor Day is coming up in New York on November 5.  As Gary just mentioned, we reconfirmed our 2019 guidance for identical sales, excluding fuel, adjusted EPS and adjusted FIFO operating profit as well as reconfirmed that we are on track to deliver $100 million in incremental operating profit through alternative profit stream growth. We want to be clear on today's call that we are not reconfirming the 3-year $400 million in incremental operating profit expectation. In November, we will give detailed 2020 annual guidance. I do want to highlight that we do expect to deliver FIFO operating profit growth in 2020 over 2019 confirmed guidance. We have outlined a handful of key goals for our Investor Day and would like to use this opportunity to provide you with a preview.  At Investor Day, we plan to reinforce our commitment to the overall framework of our Restock Kroger transformation plan, sharing what has worked well and what has not worked well thus far. We intend to do a deep dive into our supermarket business, which underpins the redefining grocery customer experience pillar of Restock Kroger. November 5 is the appropriate forum to be deliberate and to allow the experts on our team to spend the proper amount of time with our financial stakeholders to explain how we are thinking about Kroger's business model and how to measure the shareholder value created by Restock Kroger. Several of our senior executives will give detailed updates on our progress against the key metrics in our supermarket business and our momentum as well as how we think about it going forward. We will reiterate the ongoing successful results behind our asset-light, margin-rich alternative profit businesses. We will also talk about the continued strength in free cash flow since the announcement of Restock Kroger, which enabled us to get back to within our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA range earlier than expected. In addition, we will share our views on the business as we look further out beyond 2020 where growth is expected to continue.  I've said it many times before. Transformation is incredibly difficult, and that's the journey we are on with Restock Kroger. As we reflect on this journey, we want to be transparent about what went according to plan and what didn't go as anticipated. Some things are coming to fruition as we expected but just later than we thought such as identical sales momentum. Some things were unanticipated such as the lower gross profit margin in the pharmacy business that the entire industry is experiencing. Things we did expect and that are going even better than we thought include productivity improvements and cost savings.  Over the course of the 3-year plan and today's retail environment, there are lots of puts and takes. That said, I want to reiterate that Kroger is committed to FIFO operating profit growth in 2020 over 2019 confirmed guidance.  The Restock Kroger transformation journey sets the company up for long-term growth looking forward. And the benefits we have seen thus far have helped Kroger in our transformation from grocer to growth company. We have the right overall strategy and framework for this business and look forward to telling you more about it in November.  Now Gary and I will take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : Congrats on a good quarter. So first, I guess on the comp acceleration, I was curious if you can give some more color in terms of whether you saw improvement in traffic or ticket. And also, what do you believe contributed to the comp acceleration during the quarter? W. McMullen: Yes. As I mentioned in the call, in the prepared remarks, it was broad-based across most divisions. The area that we saw the biggest year-on-year improvement is average spend per item. Customers continue to go upscale and buy bigger product sizes. We also saw continued improvement in loyal households in terms of the numbers and the frequency of their visits. The other pieces to me that I was especially proud of our team is it's broad-based and it's really using our data to connect with customers one on one. Gary Millerchip : Rodney, maybe if I could just add a couple of things. I think what we're seeing, as Rodney mentioned in prepared comments too, is many of the elements that we shared in the early part of the year around the accelerators that we expected to help improve the trend in ID sales as we headed through the year have certainly started to show through in the metrics that we look at. So as you'll recall, we talked about as we start to lap the heavier price investments from last year and the space optimization changes that we made in -- predominantly in Q2 and early Q3 last year, as Rodney mentioned, is we're seeing the customer metrics that we look at internally and continue to execute better on starting to show through a trend and improving sales performance.  And while we -- as we shared on the call and in the press release, the absolute digital sales growth was a lower rate. That was really an adjustment for the Home Chef purchase a year ago. And when you look at ClickList and home delivery, they are still performing very consistently and driving significant growth. And I think we see all those components continuing to build and certainly in a way that we look to the year and expected Q2 and Q3 and beyond to play out. We're seeing a lot of those elements that we expected starting to show through in the results. Rupesh Parikh : Great. And a quick follow-up question. Any color you can provide in quarter-to-date trends? W. McMullen: If you look at quarter-to-date, obviously, a year ago, there was a hurricane that affected a couple of our divisions in a meaningful way. And we're in the middle of that happening a year ago. If you exclude those 2 divisions, we would be slightly ahead of where we were in quarter 2, but it's just slightly. And we -- I've excluded those 2 divisions just because until we get through the total cycling, it's really hard to say exactly where we'll be. But continued progress. Operator : The next question comes from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : So Rodney, curious, your take on the pharmacy business, right, where it sits today. Obviously, it looks like a fair bit of pressure on EBIT margin. How transitory do you think that is? And when you think about that business long term, I know you've always wanted to kind of own that customer because of the loyalty factor. Do you think about ways to do something with that business, right, to alleviate the pressure on the P&L? W. McMullen: The -- one, the one point you made, I think, is incredibly important. If you look at the pharmacy customer, that customer is incredibly loyal to Kroger. And when you look at their total spend, it's a fantastic customer to have. When you look at the pharmacy business overall, it continues to be very, very profitable relative to the assets invested. And obviously, year-on-year, there's headwind. But when you look at the total business, it still continues to be a strong business. The other thing is our pharmacy team has done an incredible job on -- to identifying opportunities to build the business, which obviously get a flow-through benefit of that, and significant operating changes to take costs out of the business. Now taking costs out of the business mitigated a meaningful part of the gross pressure, but still, there is more things to be done on taking costs out and process changes. So when you look at the business overall, I'm incredibly excited about the progress we're making. But looking forward, I think it's still a critical and important component of our overall business strategy. John Heinbockel : Okay. And then secondly, when you think about the Ocado rollout, right, one, much pressure on 2020. I know they won't open until '21 and probably a little pressure on '20. But then secondly, do you yet have sort of an ideal budget for the Ocado progression, right? From day 1 it opens, the shed is unprofitable by some amount and the time to profitability is x number of months or quarters. I know it's theoretical, but have you been able to get your arms around that? W. McMullen: Well, I would say we have an estimate on expectations on that, and it would be different depending on whether it's in existing market or a new market. And if you look at our budget expectations in a new market, it would take longer for ramp to profitability versus an existing market where you can move volume over on day 1.  The modeling that we've done is really using the experience Ocado has had in their ramp-ups in England and adjusting it for traffic patterns in the U.S. locations of our stores, location of customers and labor rates and those types of things. Obviously, until you get a facility open, you don't know whether all of those assumptions are correct. We would typically expect a facility to be somewhere year 2 to year 3 before it gets to profitability. But that is -- time will tell but the best of our estimates and best of the experience that Ocado has had.  The other thing that we're hoping is if you look at each facility Ocado has opened, it keeps -- it gets better on a ramp-up than the prior one. And one of the nice things is that Ocado will open up a facility in Canada that we'll be able to learn from as well plus the learnings they've had. And that's the one piece that we haven't included in the budget is the fact that they keep getting better. Gary Millerchip : And the other piece to mention and you referred to it in your opening comments as well, we're learning a lot more as we continue to see as customers evolve digitally, engaging with us. And so we have a clear model in our mind of what our expectations are, but that model continues to evolve as we learn how customer behavior changes between delivery to home, between pickup at the store and really making sure that we're optimizing the efficiency and the innovation from Ocado to really support the whole digital ecosystem. And I think that's going to continue -- gets more exciting as we think about how the way the customer is changing and how Ocado can meet those needs in the future as well. W. McMullen: Yes. And Gary just implied and I talked about it in the prepared remarks, Ocado is significantly more efficient than the way we're doing it today. Operator : The next question comes from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Edward Kelly : So Rodney, I wanted to ask you about 2020. And I know you talked about -- that you're thinking you'll grow FIFO operating profit. You didn't want to give a lot more detail, but I was hoping that you can provide some additional color around the key drivers to that. And then I also wanted to ask, because you've pulled guidance now, which is okay because no one thought you were going to get there. But you've also introduced uncertainty to investors because we don't know what you're thinking. Is there some minimum expectation that you could at least speak to today to help us out in terms of how you're thinking about 2020 and where this business is going? W. McMullen: Yes. A couple of comments. And as you mentioned, we'll get to a whole lot more detail in November on all the pieces, and we'll also talk about 2020 and beyond. If you look at the key drivers, it would continue to be identical sales growth. Obviously, managing our gross profit margin. We continue to find a lot of cost opportunities, everything from process changes to cost of goods to goods not for resale. And in fact, one of the things that we're identifying there is there's a longer stream of opportunities than what we had even originally expected as part of Restock Kroger.  On the guidance for 2020, that was the reason that I made the comment that we did want to be clear that we expect 2020 operating profit dollars to grow over 2019 provided guidance, just to make sure that people understood that we do expect a growth. We're in the middle of the process, and it's a process normally we wouldn't finish until March of next year when we would give this next year guidance. We are accelerating it until November because we think it's incredibly important to do that, but we are in the process on specifics. But we did want to make sure that everybody understood that we do expect growth. Edward Kelly : All right. So just follow-ups on this. So from a gross margin standpoint, your gross margin ex fuel, pharmacy kind of flattening out. Can we expect that to continue over time? And then secondly, at your leverage target, historically, you've been very good about returning cash to shareholders, particularly through share buyback when your stock is perceived to be undervalued. Could that be a larger portion -- or could that be a larger initiative next year? Gary Millerchip : Thanks for the follow-up questions. This is Gary. I'll take them in the order that you asked the questions. So on gross margins, certainly, we do continue to invest in price. And as Rodney mentioned, there are significant offsets in the investments that we're making in the way that we're managing cost of goods in the team. And over time, we expect, as we've shared, as we reclassified alternative profit, that will also become a tailwind that offsets investments and helps gross margin as well. So while we certainly believe that price investments are sort of critical part of the strategy, we do expect it to look different from what you would have seen in 2018 and 2017 in terms of a level of investment when you look at the time that we have for 2019 and the rest of the year.  As you know, we use our data and insights, too, to really understand what's important for the customer. And we're continuing to make sure we're priced right on the products that matter most to the customer, both from everyday pricing and from the way we personalize the offers through using the data that we uniquely have available to us because 96% of data is tethered to a loyalty card. But we also know from customer insights that it's not just about price, and ultimately, our customers decide to shop at Kroger because certainly of value but then also the quality of the products, the personalization that we can offer through our data and the freshness and the experience. And so we do feel good around the plan for the rest of the year as we head into 2020 around how we'll manage those levers.  From a free cash flow perspective, to the second part of your question, I'll really just maybe reinforce a couple of comments that we made in the prepared remarks that you should certainly expect Kroger to be -- continue to be focusing on how do we maximize free cash flow for the value of our shareholders. We are now about within the range. It's important to us that we demonstrate we are consistently back in the range because there can be some volatility in a retail business, and we want to make sure that we've delivered on our commitment to operate within the range. But certainly now that we're there and we expect to continue to generate free cash flow, we will be looking very closely at what's the most effective way to return capital to shareholders. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : It's also a follow-up on 2020. You mentioned that your cost takeouts and your productivity initiatives are doing better than what you previously expected. But obviously, for you to back off some of your prior target, there are things that are not going as well as you anticipated. So can you give us more detail whether it's your ID sales growth, the market being tougher than you expected, the alternative profit stream. On each of those different levers, can you give us more detail on what's not going as well as you expected? W. McMullen: Sure. Yes. A couple of those tie back to what we talked about before. But the pharmacy, obviously, is at a different level than what we expected when we did the original expectations just in terms of market structural changes that's happened to everybody in the industry. Obviously, identical sales made progress -- are making progress, but it's taking us longer than what we expected. If you look at alternative profit, it continues to be ahead of what we expected and continues to grow strongly. And in November, we will give more details on all of those. And productivity and process changes and cost opportunities, we continue to see a big pipeline for those and even more than what we originally expected. And just to remind everybody, we're taking over $1 billion a year of costs out to operate the company. Michael Lasser : And my follow-up, Rodney, is when you put together this plan, you had some assumption about the competitive landscape, both from bricks-and-mortar players as well as the emerging digital threat. How is the overall market environment relative to where you thought it was going to be? Is it -- presumably given that you're backing off some of these targets, it's probably a little tougher than you anticipated. Is that fair? W. McMullen: No. I would -- when you look at the competitive environment overall, I would say it's pretty similar to what we thought at the time. The pharmacy would be the exclusion to that, that I mentioned. But when you look at new operators in the market, we assumed that it would continue to be important. We've been proactive, especially since we merged with Harris Teeter, making sure that we created seamless experience and have a strong digital offering. And I always tell everybody, job one is to make sure we don't lose the customer; job two is we'll figure out how to make it profitable. And we're indifferent whether somebody shops digitally with us or in a store. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, this quarter, we actually saw that headwind was less in the second quarter year-on-year from a digital standpoint.  So when you look at overall, I would say, we would say pretty much what we expected. Pharmacy is a little different. And we knew that there would be a transition period that we needed to transform the company, which is what drove us behind the Restock Kroger commitments. Operator : The next question comes from Judah Frommer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Judah Frommer : Maybe just a couple more follow-ups. I think like Ed said, it's not a big surprise that the guides pulled. Can you clarify if it's just the operating profit piece that's pulled? Is the free cash flow guide still intact? Or is everything gone? Gary Millerchip : Thanks for the question. So as Rodney mentioned, we really plan to give you far more detail in November. And we felt it was really important that we committed to doing that in 6 or 7 weeks from now to be able to provide all the color. We still have obviously huge confidence in the level of free cash flow that we're generating within the company and continues to be a strength in this year. I do think we would want to provide additional guidance on that alongside, as Rodney mentioned, our future financial strategy and how we create value for shareholders at the November meeting. Judah Frommer : Okay. That certainly makes sense. And kind of in terms of what hasn't gone right versus what has, I would imagine that this quarter gives you more confidence in kind of the go-forward process. ID is above 2%, gross margin ex fuel and the pharmacy down in the low double-digit range. Is part of the, I would say, pulling or pushing out operating profit dollar growth to perhaps beyond 2020, is part of that getting back to a more normalized supermarket operating environment and delivery of supermarket operating income growth? And can we expect that kind of this quarter and the guidance for the next couple quarters is indicative of what you think a normalized level is? W. McMullen: We'll get into more details in November. But a couple of comments I would add to your comments, and I mentioned it in the first quarter earnings call. If you look at the things that we measure internally in terms of how -- the feedback customers give us on what kind of experience we're giving them, what we find is that there's always a lag behind identical sales and when the customer tells us we're doing a better job. And when you look at the second quarter, we certainly felt like that was a reflection of that and we continue to improve the experience. To get into a lot more details on it, I really think we're probably better off to where we have a lot of time in November where we can go line by line. But I do think it was important for everybody to understand we do expect 2020 to have operating profit growth over the '19 confirmed commitment. Judah Frommer : Okay. If I can just squeeze one follow-up. Is there a way you can address maybe market share in the quarter relative to your market share trends over the last few -- I mean 2.2% is certainly well above kind of industry scanner data. W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at market share overall, we would say basically it's flat. It's within -- it's probably up or down as mentioned, but I would say we're not satisfied, but it's moving in the right direction. Operator : The next question comes from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Robert Ohmes : Actually, 2 questions. Rodney or Gary, the continued rollout of delivery and pickup, can you give us some help thinking about the shape of that impacting your EBITDA margin? Is it -- do you get to a point later this year or next year where you start to anniversary pressures and you see alleviation from the pressures of that rollout? Any kind of help on that would be great. And second, I just want to follow up on the dry grocery inflation commentary. Is that something that's building momentum? Is that CPG company pressure? Is that something that is a tailwind for IDs in the back half and maybe into next year? That would be helpful as well. W. McMullen: Thanks, Robby. Gary Millerchip : So on digital, first of all, we are certainly -- continue to be very excited around what we see in the way that customers engage with us differently as they start to become more of a -- Rodney referred to as a seamless customer where we're delivering for the customer both, whether it's delivery to home or ship to home. And everything we see about the way that customer engages more deeply with us shows the value of that overall relationship across all the channels of store and digital working together. I know we've shared before that when we look at spend lift, we see a significant spend lift from the customer when they fill that first basket, it's a much higher basket and a significant part of that spend is incremental. And then over time, we also see customers actually move to a position where their visits in the store actually increase as well as they overall build their loyalty with us.  And so you're right, Robby, it's very much a maturation curve, if you like. And so we monitor every store and every vintage of the business that goes through that maturation of launching pickup and launching delivery to home. And what we see is that, that curve where by about year 2, year 3 of the customer engagement in those stores, we start to become really agnostic around how the customer is shopping with us because of the incrementality that we see overall in that behavior and how that mold to Kroger.  So as they're starting to come through that maturity curve, that's really what Rodney was referring to when he mentioned that we start to see digital less of a financial headwind in the Q2 this year and then into the second half of this year because we're really starting to see the maturation of that business, partly the customer behavior obviously accelerating, but also because we don't have the same start-up costs and the same investments in launching those services.  So we certainly expect that to continue, and we are very focused on how do we maintain and accelerate the growth of customer engagement through digital. We were pleased that we have continuation of digital household engagement growing again during the quarter, and that's very much a focus for us. As we continue to grow their loyalty and we get past that maturation point, as Rodney said, it's still an investment overall for the business. So where we get even more excited when you think about the technology with Ocado and the opportunity to automate some of the back-end operation, if you like, providing those services because that has the potential to significantly shorten the path to profitability as well when you think about the way the customer shops with us seamlessly overall. Robert Ohmes : So would you say, Gary, that the peak EBITDA margin pressure from the rollout of pickup and delivery has been passed and we just passed it this quarter? Gary Millerchip : That's essentially what we're seeing overall within the way we look at our digital business and the way you look at that customer maturation. That's right. But that's kind of what Rodney was referring to. W. McMullen: And Gary -- I agree with Gary's point, and we also continue to invest in Ship and some of the other components as well. That is a high start-up cost, but that's even reflected in the numbers that Gary talked about. Robert Ohmes : Great. And then just on the inflation outlook for dry grocery and what's driving that. Gary Millerchip : Sure. Obviously, we deal with the question of CPG partners addressing price increases all the time. It's something that we deal with on a case-by-case basis, and we feel we're in a particularly strong position to really understand what's happening there because of our own brand products and the way in which we can have those conversations to make sure that the price increases are legitimate cost increases coming through to us. Certainly, as we shared, we are seeing our range for the year on inflation which we were assuming it would be somewhere between 0 to 1% and what we're actually seeing in a couple of those categories that I mentioned in the prepared comments that we're slightly ahead of that range. We continue to obviously manage to try and mitigate those through cost of goods opportunities and certainly where we do see the price increases coming through. And we believe they're legitimate, we are looking to pass them on to customers where it makes sense in light of the competitive environment. W. McMullen: The other thing, Gary, just one addition that I think is always important to remind and we always remind our CPG partners, if they're raising costs more than the market is going up, our own brands always gains share. And it's incredible, strong quality product obviously. It's something that has been part of Kroger for a long, long time. And we continue to even be -- add more innovation and more lines in terms of the Kroger brand itself, Private Selection and Simple Truth. So anytime a CPG adds -- changes cost versus what the market is doing from raw materials, what happens is our brands gain share as well, and that's also something I think is important to remind everybody. Operator : The next question is from Karen Short with Barclays. Karen Short : Just curious. So back to the 2020 goals, I mean, obviously, you gave a pretty detailed answer on what was a little tougher. I think pharmacy stands out and ID is obviously taking a little longer. But fuel has obviously been a much bigger tailwind for you. So -- and I get that hasn't changed. That's been the case, fuel continues to be a tailwind for you. So I guess what I'm curious about is what really changed from 1Q when you reiterated the $3.5 billion to today? Gary Millerchip : Thanks for the question, Karen. Certainly, from a fuel perspective to kind of cover the first part, you're absolutely right. From an overall performance of the business this year, we feel the fuel business has continued to demonstrate great strength. And it demonstrates the sort of the value, we believe, in the diversity of the portfolio of business that we now have. Obviously, everything is built up the foundation of food and that frequency of shop and the way customers are engaging with us and the loyalty we create. But when you think about food alongside health care, the fuel margins that we're generating in our alternative profit streams, we feel good about the way it allows us to manage through some of these changes as they -- as we see them that are outside of our control, and particularly in the case of the pharmacy headwinds that we referred to earlier on the call.  As we talk around 2020, as Rodney mentioned, we do want to make sure we provide you with a lot more color at the November meeting around how we're thinking about the growth in the business. I know Rodney has obviously already referred to a couple of elements around areas of the business that we've learned a lot. And as you alluded to in your comments, we've shared, I think, very openly that we embarked on a major transformation for the company, which involved transforming the experience in the stores. And digitally, it involves standing up a number of new businesses around alternative profit streams and taking a dramatic amount of costs out of the business.  So I think a lot of what we've been learning, as we've shared, is that as we get smarter and better in understanding how will those pieces come together and the speed at which they will deliver the benefits that we're expecting to Restock Kroger, we thought it was important to share with you today that we do believe that we'll deliver growth next year and operating -- FIFO operating profit over the confirmed guidance for 2019 and that we want to make sure that we spend the appropriate amount of time in November really taking you through what's worked, the areas where we believe we still have opportunity to improve and how we see 2020 further shaping up. W. McMullen: And 2020 and beyond as well. Karen Short : Okay. That is fair. And then I guess looking at the results this quarter, given obviously, again, strong fuel, I get core down 30-ish, 31% in 2Q. And I think it's fair to say that some of that is not within your control because it is pharmacy-related. So wondering if you could just get me -- give some color as to whether or not that number is kind of consistent with where your numbers shake out. But also maybe if you could parse out what the actual pharmacy, both specialty and regular pharmacy, might have done in terms of pressuring the core. Gary Millerchip : I think that the best guidance we can give, kind of if we just refer back to a few of the points that we shared in the release and some of the comments that we made, Rodney mentioned it, from a supermarket perspective, when you take out fuel and retail pharmacy, essentially, the operating margins are relatively stable. And the pharmacy and the Kroger specialty pharmacy business were obviously a meaningful headwind during the quarter because of some of the industry headwinds that we see overall.  But when you look at the investment in gross margin of 12 basis points that we shared around the supermarket business, excluding retail, pharmacy and fuel, and then the 14 basis points of OG&A benefit that we saw in the quarter, that's kind of really where I think is the best kind of data we would point you to, to give you a sense of what's going on in the business. And obviously, the gross margin, excluding fuel gross margin, investment was 29 basis points. And you get a sense of the disconnect, if you like, between what the health business impact to the quarter versus what the core retail gross margin investment was excluding pharmacy.  Sorry, we just have time for one last question. Operator : And that question will come from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Thomas Palmer : It's Tom Palmer on for Ken. Just a couple quick ones for you. First, you called out hurricanes as a tailwind a year ago for the third quarter. Is -- I mean, is there going to be some offset in the southeast just given what we've seen with maybe people stocking up for Dorian? W. McMullen: Dorian was helped a little bit but not to the same degree as the hurricanes last year hit that center. And if you look in terms of just timing, the next 3 or 4 days will look altogether different because when a hurricane actually hits, then you have stores closed and customers aren't able to get into the business, into our stores. The thing about -- as you know, in hurricanes, you never know when the next one is going to hit. And what we always try to do is to make sure that we're ready there in advance for our customers. We support our associates and we're there. As soon as it's safe to be back, we get our stores back and open and operating. And we'll have -- our associates will go to whatever store they can get to, to work versus their home store. But anything at all, as soon as it's safe -- we understand we're an essential component of a community and make sure we're there for them. So I always say Kroger is at its best when there's events like this happens in terms of supporting communities and people. Thomas Palmer : And then you've alluded to kind of the ability to look towards share repurchases again. Is that contemplated in your guidance for this year? Or would that essentially be upside if you go that direction? W. McMullen: At this point, we really haven't made any decision on repurchases for the balance of the year. And if there was anything, it would be extremely modest. As you know, we just now got back into the range. As Gary mentioned, we want to make sure that we're judicious and not -- and look at cash flow as it's being generated and balance all the pieces. So at this point, I think it's a little early to say. I don't know, Gary, anything you want to add to that? Gary Millerchip : I think that's right, Rodney. Certainly, we're actively looking and making sure that we're maximizing free cash flow. But at this point, we want to make sure we're consistent within the range and as soon as we feel we're in that position, but it's certainly not contemplated currently in the guidance that we provided for 2019. W. McMullen: Thanks, everyone, for all the questions. So as always, before we end today's call, I'd like to share a few final comments directed toward our associates who listen in and how we all live our purpose every day. To our associates, thank you for your hard work. I am fortunate to meet so many of you across the company and hear the incredible stories of what you do every day for each other and the communities. From our stores to plants and distribution centers and our corporate and division teams, you inspire me beyond my ability to express in words. Your passion for and focus on our customers is just incredible. More importantly, I am so proud of how you support each other and come together as a team. We are 460,000 strong, and we are Kroger proud.  September is a special month for us as it marks the second anniversary of Kroger's social impact plan, Zero Hunger | Zero Waste. We know we can't achieve this goal alone. And recently, the Kroger Co. Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Foundation announced its inaugural cohort of 7 innovators who will join us in achieving our bold goal. Thank you to all of our customers, associates and suppliers who make our business successful every day of the year.  That completes our call today. Thanks for joining, and we look forward to seeing you in November. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Rebekah Manis, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Rebekah Manis : Thank you, Gary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on the business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our third quarter press release and our prepared remarks for this conference will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. W. McMullen: Thank you, Rebekah. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. With me to review Kroger's third quarter 2019 results is Chief Financial Officer Gary Millerchip.  I would like to thank those of you who were able to attend our investor conference last month where we shared our progress on Restock Kroger. We believe that Restock Kroger is the right framework to reposition our business to create value for all of our stakeholders. It provides us with a clear purpose and our vision to serve America through food inspiration and uplift. It focuses us on redefining the customer experience, identifying the partners who will help us deliver customer value today and in the future and putting the right talent and teams in place to focus on growth in our supermarket business and our alternative profit businesses.  We are proud of the progress we have made, and we've learned from the challenges we've experienced. We are on track with a stable and growing supermarket business as a result of our customer obsession, renewed intensity around operational excellence and continued investment in seamless. We are growing our supermarket business by focusing on 3 levers to drive identical sales : fresh, power brands and data and personalization. And we continue to build a seamless ecosystem that is available, relevant and accessible for our customers. All of this combined to generate positive results in the third quarter.  We continued to grow identical sales, reduce costs and deliver strong free cash flow. We had a broad-based identical sales improvement. 15 of our divisions had increasing supermarket identical sales without fuel compared to the second quarter. We delivered a slightly improved FIFO gross margin, excluding fuel and pharmacy. Headwinds in pharmacy were offset by strong fuel performance during the quarter. We are on track to deliver $100 million in incremental operating profit through alternative profit stream growth.  Kroger continues to invest in digital as we build a seamless ecosystem for our customers. We know our customers value greater convenience this provides, and our data shows it's an essential component of growing overall loyalty. Digitally engaged customers not only drive growth through our digital modalities, they also help drive brick-and-mortar sales growth as well and share of wallet. So seamless is a both, not an either/or.  Our data clearly shows that over time and after initial investments, the profitability of a digital customer is the same as an in-store customer. We continue to see an improving operating profit trend in digital, and therefore, our investments are maturing as expected and consistent with the graph we shared at Investor Day.  Our digital sales grew 21% in the third quarter. As we shared previously, we expect our digital sales growth to moderate year-over-year primarily due to the cycling of Home Chef and as a result of our disciplined focus on growing the Ship customer. We have expanded our digital coverage to reach 96% of our customers. This means that 96% of our customers who shop Kroger in a brick-and-mortar store can also shop with us for pickup or delivery.  We continue to invest in digital platforms as this is where the customers are increasingly going to meet many of their needs. Providing our customers with the ability to have anything, anytime, anywhere from Kroger sets us apart from a large segment of our competitors and will drive loyalty as well as our long-term growth and margin expansion.  We continue the rollout of Ocado facilities. In November, Kroger announced plans for a new high-tech customer fulfillment center in Wisconsin. The automated warehouse will serve customers in Wisconsin, Northern Illinois and Northwest Indiana. What's so exciting about Ocado is their model to deliver to the customer is significantly less costly than our existing model and any of the other models we've examined as well. Not only will these facilities accelerate our ability to provide customers with a seamless experience, they will also help us to do it in a much more cost-effective way. We know Ocado's value is not just its current capabilities but also how quickly the company is able to innovate to serve a rapidly developing online consumer market. One of the comments we made at IR Day is that Ocado keeps learning and improving their model. Ocado's recent announcement of a micro fulfillment center in Bristol is a good example of this.  We believe that the food industry is special. It is huge, a $1.5 trillion market. And not only do people need to eat, they love to eat. Food isn't a commodity, but it's the center of our lives. Customers deserve a partner like Kroger who can provide inspiration and fulfill their passion for food. And unlike our national competitors, Kroger is food first. We believe that no matter who you are, where you're from, how you shop or what you like to eat, everyone deserves to have affordable, easy-to-enjoy fresh food that tastes amazing.  As we shared in November, fresh is an important driver of sales for Kroger. Our fresh departments drive trips, loyalty and gross margin. Our product standards, selection criteria and supply chain are core strengths and are built to deliver first-to-market and best-of-season fresh products across the United States.  Our produce department led the way in sales for the quarter, demonstrating how our store teams are focused on improving everyday execution in ways that are highly relevant to our customers. In addition, we launched our Fresh for Everyone brand transformation campaign, and the initial feedback from both our customers and our associates is very positive.  One of the many ways we demonstrate our passion for food is through Kroger's best-in-class Our Brands portfolio. While many grocers offer private label products, Our Brands is a real differentiator for Kroger because our customers tell us through blind taste tests that Our Brands' quality is better than not only the competitors' private label products but also many leading national brands as well. Kroger's Our Brands grew 3.4% this quarter. We also introduced 231 new Our Brand items during the third quarter.  Kroger's third differentiating lever to drive identical sales growth is personalization. Data is a differentiator for Kroger. Many retailers have transactional data, but none have the customer data and the insights to make meaningful suggestions to their customers like Kroger. We continue to see incredible effectiveness and efficiency from a focus on loyal customers and investing in their satisfaction.  One specific area I'd like to highlight is our strong fuel points program. As we shared at the Investor Day conference last month, an amazing 83% of our loyal customers engage with our fuel rewards program each year. We are increasingly targeting promotion and personalization of fuel rewards, and fuel drove trips and sales in the third quarter. We are using the power of Kroger's stable and growing supermarket business to create meaningful incremental operating profit through the alternative profit stream businesses, which adds up to a business built for long-term growth that generates consistently attractive total shareholder returns.  Kroger continues to generate strong and durable free cash flow as reflected by the fact that the company has reduced debt by $1.5 billion over the prior 4 quarters and continues to increase its dividend to create value for shareholders. We are confident that we can deliver even stronger TSR in the future because of our strong free cash flow and sustainable net earnings growth.  Restock Kroger is the right framework to reposition our business to create value for all of our stakeholders both today and the future.  And now I will turn it over to Gary for more details into the quarter financials. Gary? Gary Millerchip : Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. I want to echo Rodney and thank those of you who were able to attend or view the Investor Day webcast last month. As we shared in New York, our model for a strong and durable retail supermarket business begins with the customer and our obsession with increasing customer loyalty. We believe that our intensified focus on execution and continued improvements in the value and experience we deliver for our customers is driving increased identical sales across our store and digital ecosystem.  To drive sustainable sales growth for the long term, we will continue to invest in areas of the business that are important to the customer. This includes ongoing investments in talent, price, digital and store experience, with an even greater emphasis on fresh, Our Brands and personalization. We are demonstrating through the first 3 quarters of the year we are being very deliberate in balancing these investments with disciplined execution of cost savings that simplify our business.  Our supermarket business and the traffic and data this generates serves as the foundation from which we are able to drive higher growth in our asset-light, margin-rich alternative profit businesses that we continue to expect to accelerate our results. We expect our model to deliver improved operating results over time and continued strong free cash flow, and we expect this to translate into a consistently strong and attractive total shareholder return through EPS growth driven by sustained net earnings growth and the return of cash to shareholders via share repurchase, plus a growing dividend over time.  Now I'd like to share third quarter results. For the quarter, we delivered an adjusted EPS of $0.47 per diluted share. As noted in this morning's press release, that includes a $0.03 out-of-period charge that I will share more detail on in a moment. But first, I'll highlight a few areas of our business that were particularly robust.  Our Brands contributed as both a sales driver and a profit leader. The entire Kroger team brought discipline to controlling costs during the third quarter, and our fuel performance mitigated retail pharmacy gross margin headwinds in the quarter. LIFO charge for the quarter was $23 million compared to $12 million for the same period last year driven by inflation in dry grocery, pharmacy and dairy. We now estimate LIFO for the year to be approximately $90 million versus our original expectation of $50 million.  Our adjusted corporate tax rate for the quarter was 70 basis points higher than the same period last year due to a decrease in the benefits of federal tax credits and an increase in reserves.  I'll now provide additional detail about 2 specific items that affected our results in the third quarter. First, the out-of-period charge of $29 million that I referenced earlier. This charge is related to a provision in a single pharmacy contract that should have been recognized over the previous 6 quarters. Given the complexity of the contract and the introduction of new clawback provisions, a part of the contract was misinterpreted. The required correction was identified in our standard management review process. This charge is not material to total company results, and the financial effect in each of the prior individual quarters was immaterial to net earnings per diluted share. However, the cumulative effect on our performance in the third quarter reduced adjusted net earnings per diluted share by $0.03 and gross margin by 9 basis points. We, therefore, felt it was important to provide a greater level of insight into this item. There is no effect on earnings guidance for 2019 or 2020 as a result of this contract going forward.  I'd now like to talk about Lucky's Market. During our investor conference last month, we committed to continue to be disciplined in prioritizing capital allocation to improve return on invested capital and create sustainable shareholder return. As part of a portfolio review, we made the decision to evaluate strategic alternatives in relation to our investment in Lucky's Market. As a result of this review, the company has decided to divest its interest in Lucky's Market and recognized an impairment charge of $238 million in the third quarter. Accounting rules require Kroger to record the gross amount in operating profit. However, the real economic interest to Kroger is a pretax charge of $131 million. Additional details are provided in the financial tables of our press release.  The impairment charge is a noncash charge and reflects the write-down of our initial investment in Lucky's Market as well as additional funding provided to operate and grow the business. There is no effect on earnings guidance for 2020 as a result of this decision.  Turning now to some of the highlights in the third quarter as underlying trends were very robust. Kroger reported identical sales without fuel of 2.5% during the third quarter, marking our strongest quarter since we launched Restock program. Several supermarket departments outperformed the company, including produce, key beverage categories, pharmacy and natural foods. Digital contributed approximately 70 basis points to identical sales, with Kroger pickup and delivery continuing to show strong momentum. Adjusted FIFO operating profit for the third quarter was $653 million compared to $664 million in the third quarter of 2018. Gross margin was 22.1% of sales for the third quarter.  FIFO gross margin, excluding fuel, decreased 24 basis points from the same period last year primarily driven by industry-wide lower gross margin rates in pharmacy and continued growth in our specialty pharmacy business.  Gross margin rate, excluding fuel and pharmacy, improved slightly in the quarter as cost of goods savings and growth in alternative businesses offset continued retail price investments.  While profitability in retail pharmacy is lower than we had budgeted this year, it remains an important part of our strategy and continues to generate good returns. We were pleased to see the decline in gross margin rate compared to last year was lower in the third quarter than the first 2 quarters of 2019, and this trend is expected to continue in quarter 4.  As a result of continued growth in pharmacy sales, improved product sourcing and initiatives that lower the cost of fill trips, our expectation is that pharmacy profitability will be less of a headwind in 2020.  Our associates continue to do an impressive job managing shrink, which improved in the third quarter compared to last year. This represents the ninth consecutive quarter of year-over-year shrink rate improvement.  OG&A cost as a rate of sales, excluding fuel and adjustment items, decreased 15 basis points. This was achieved through broad-based improvement of Restock Kroger cost-saving initiatives.  We remain on track to achieve over $1 billion of cost savings in 2019 on top of the $1 billion savings achieved last year. We also have clear line of sight to the $1 billion of incremental savings in 2020 that we shared at our investor conference. These savings are being achieved through improved productivity and automation, elimination of waste, improved sourcing of goods not for resale and administrative efficiencies.  Like many industries, grocery retail is navigating through disruptive change. As part of the company's ongoing evolution, store operating divisions recently evaluated and reduced middle management roles to ensure they have the right talent in the right roles closest to our customers in store leadership positions. As a result, Kroger incurred severance charges in the third quarter totaling $80 million.  Fuel is an important part of our strategy to drive customer engagement, and our loyal customers continue to receive hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel rewards each year in the form of price discount at the pump. As Rodney mentioned, fuel is driving lower customer trips and sales, and the amount of fuel rewards paid to loyal customers increased by 8% in the third quarter.  The average retail price of fuel was $2.62 this quarter versus $2.81 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin in the third quarter was $0.30 compared to $0.26 in the same quarter last year. Fuel is a great example of Kroger's sourcing teams continuing to improve buying practices. This allowed us to achieve improvement in fuel cost of goods in the third quarter.  Alternative profit streams are on track to contribute an incremental $100 million in operating profit in 2019. Media and Kroger Personal Finance continue to be the primary drivers of growth this year. Kroger Precision Marketing continues to build momentum, increasing engagement to over 1,000 brands with a 90% retention rate and significantly higher spend. We have relationships with all major agency holding companies supporting their media activations as they deploy brand-building programs. Our Media business continues to release new inventory and create new publisher relationships to support the demand of advertisers.  And now to update on labor relations. As we have previously shared, we are proud that our average hourly rate is over $20 with comprehensive benefits factored in, benefits that many of our competitors don't offer. As a result of Kroger's investments in our associates, we are improving employee retention in one of the tightest labor markets in years. We continue to invest in our associates as part of Restock Kroger in a variety of ways, including investments in wages, training and development.  We ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW covering associates in Southern California, Portland, Seattle and Michigan during the quarter. We are currently negotiating with the UFCW for contracts covering store associates in Las Vegas and Memphis. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We strive to make our overall benefit package relevant today to associates. Our financial results continue to be pressured by inefficient health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions which represent many of our associates on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.  A key element of our capital allocation strategy is to use our free cash flow to invest in the business and drive profitable growth while also maintaining our current investment-grade debt rating and returning capital to shareholders. We actively balance the use of cash flow to achieve these goals. We committed to prioritize free cash flow in 2019 to reduce the company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio to within our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Over the last 12 months, net total debt has reduced by $1.5 billion, and Kroger's net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 2.5 for the third quarter of 2019 compared to 2.72 a year ago. We remain committed to our target net total debt to adjusted EBITDA range.  Now that we are operating within our target range, and as we expect to generate strong free cash flow, we anticipate starting to buy back shares in the fourth quarter under our $1 billion Board authorization. This is not expected to have a material impact on fourth quarter EPS. Turning now to guidance for 2019. We continue to expect identical sales growth, excluding fuel, to range from 2% to 2.25% in 2019. We continue to expect adjusted net earnings to range from $2.15 to $2.25 per diluted share and adjusted FIFO operating profit to range from $2.9 billion to $3 billion for 2019.  We expect underlying identical sales growth in the fourth quarter will be similar to third quarter. However, incremental SNAP dollars that were in the market in January 2019 represent about a 50% -- 50 basis point -- excuse me, 50 basis point headwind in the quarter. We, therefore, anticipated reported ID sales will be towards the lower end of our 2019 guidance range for quarter 4 as we cycle the effect of SNAP.  We continue to expect the fourth quarter to deliver double-digit EPS growth on an adjusted basis. Where we land with our adjusted EPS annual guidance range will be heavily influenced by fuel margins in the fourth quarter, which were at record highs in quarter 4 last year. Our customers' shopping behaviors affected by the lower SNAP dollars in market in January will also influence the outcome.  As you know, we typically share annual guidance when we report our fourth quarter results in March. But this year, we provided guidance for 2020 several months early. We remain confident in the 2020 guidance that we shared last month at our Investor Day in New York.  And now I'll turn it back to Rodney. W. McMullen: Thanks, Gary. As I shared when we first began the call, we believe that Restock Kroger is the right framework to reposition our business and create value for all of our stakeholders. We are on track with a stable and growing grocery business as a result of our customer obsession, renewed intensity around operational excellence and continued development of our seamless ecosystem. Our focus on the fundamentals generated positive results in our supermarket business in the third quarter, which gives us strong momentum heading into the holiday season.  Now we look forward to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Edward Kelly : I just wanted to start with a question on the Q4 outlook. So you have a fairly wide range. That, I guess, implies earnings growth anywhere from sort of like mid-singles all the way up over 20%. One question, I think, that I have related to this is what are the puts and takes around that range? And I know you mentioned fuel, but a second question related to that is that to get to these numbers sort of either way, you need core grocery earnings to improve, and that's despite what is a harder comparison on SNAP and quite frankly recent pressure in grocery. So can you just kind of walk us through those puts and takes and then what you think will drive core grocery earnings to inflect positively in Q4? Gary Millerchip : Yes. Thanks for the question. I'll cover that. So you're correct, we expect -- as I mentioned in the prepared comments, we are expecting adjusted EPS growth to be in the double digits in the fourth quarter. Obviously, as I mentioned a moment ago, we're assuming and expecting identical sales growth to be in the range in the quarter, continuing the sort of trend that we saw in Q3, but there will be some SNAP headwinds that will bring it down towards the lower end of the range. So that's the kind of core assumption around ID sales for the quarter. We do cycle some investments. In Q4 last year, if you recall that we set up costs around some facilities in D.C. So from a gross margin perspective, we do have some tailwinds that will help the quarter. We also expect to continue to see the cost-saving improvements that we've been accelerating throughout the year as we continue to execute on the $1 billion cost-saving plan. And of course, I think we shared on previous quarters that alternative profit streams tends to be skewed more towards the fourth quarter, predominantly because both KPS has a heavy fourth quarter influence on the results and then Media continues to accelerate, and Q4 is always a higher Media quarter as well. So you combine an accelerating rate and the fact that Media is higher in the fourth quarter helps the alternative profit part of the business to continue to grow.  In terms of the sort of puts and takes in the quarter that could influence where we finish in the range, on the headwind side, obviously, we have been investing in a new brand launch, and we're obviously spending dollars there in continuing to improve the messaging and translating that into a connection with our customers. We also launched the promotion on free pickup for the quarter as well and seeing how that plays out in terms of customer behavior. And then, of course, we also have the fuel headwind in the fourth quarter where our rate was $0.34, which was a record high last year. So those would be the headwinds that we're pushing against versus the assumptions I mentioned earlier. The unknowns around the range, really, with fuel being a record high in the fourth quarter last year, if fuel performs in line with where it's been on average for the year-to-date position, it would obviously be at a certain level. If it was -- which is a $0.29 to $0.30 range, if it was at the similar level as last year at $0.34, that makes a meaningful difference to how the quarter ends. And then, of course, seeing how customers behave as a result of the SNAP dollars not being in market in January is a further factor in really causing us to leave the range as wide as it is. But we do feel confident in the way we see the model in the fourth quarter, which is why we still believe double-digit growth in the earnings per share is what we'd expect to achieve. Edward Kelly : And just a follow-up. It seems like what's new in terms of what we're learning in the guidance this quarter is it -- I guess it seems like there's a $0.03 pharmacy charge that's in the guidance given that it's in your $0.47. Your LIFO charge is going up by $0.04. So that seems to be something that's a bit more unexpected. What's offsetting that to allow you to maintain guidance? W. McMullen: Ed, this is Rodney. Just a couple of comments, and I'll let Gary fill in. Obviously, our identicals continue to improve and strong there. If you look at gross margin without fuel and pharmacy, a slight improvement there. We had great balance between cost improvements and gross investment and it's the continuation of those pieces coming together. So it's really -- the core business continuing to improve and move in the right direction, that's providing the tailwind to offset the $0.03 on the pharmacy that was out-of-a-quarter adjustment and the LIFO as well. I don't know, Gary, anything? Gary Millerchip : I would completely agree with you, Rodney. I think the key thing for us is that, to your point, that those headwinds, even with those headwinds, if you strip those back in the quarter and look at Q3, underlying EPS and operating profit would have been positive excluding the out-of-period adjustment, as Rodney mentioned. Obviously, ID sales was very positive during the quarter. But we mentioned on the call, we didn't include it in the press release, but the impact of the out-of-period on gross margin rate was 9 basis points. So actually, in the quarter, gross margin rate, even with the pharmacy headwinds that we called out, would have been balanced with OG&A improvements over 15. So we were 24 basis points reported gross margin decline, excluding fuel. Taking out those 9 basis points, you get to the 15 basis points of underlying, if you like, gross margin investment after the -- excluding the onetime -- sorry, the out-of-period adjustment.  So when we look at 15 basis points of investment, including pharmacy headwinds that we faced and we achieved 15 basis points of OG&A improvement, we actually feel like the progress that we're seeing in the model has been masked quite a bit in the quarter and we feel very positive about the underlying trends that we're seeing in the business. Operator : The next question is from Judah Frommer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Judah Frommer : Maybe first, just following up on fuel. Can you help us with the benefit you're getting from improved sourcing and the sustainability of that relative to just kind of a general step higher in industry profitability and how that's playing out? W. McMullen: It's a combination of really some technology investments that we've made in terms of how to buy fuel and making sure, from a market standpoint, how we're pricing on a daily basis and reacting to what our competitors are doing. So it's the benefit of the way fuel is being bought plus being much more disciplined relative to the market. So it's really the combination of those.  In terms of expectations going forward, from a procurement standpoint, we don't believe that's something that will continue to incrementally get better. We do believe it's something that we'll be able to maintain, and it's something that we've reflected in our guidance going forward. Judah Frommer : Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just following up on the Lucky's write-down. I don't think it was that long ago that you guys were citing double-digit IDs at Lucky's and great trends in produce. Maybe just a little bit more on the decision to exit the investment, the write-down of the investment. And is there any commentary on that kind of subchannel of food retail, kind of the specialized fresh-led food retailers and smaller boxes that's causing you to say maybe the traditional larger store fresh-led format is the way to go? W. McMullen: Yes, it really gets back to Gary's comments in the prepared remarks is -- and we talked about at Investor Day, it's really reviewing our whole portfolio of things that we are involved with and working on. And it really -- the amount of investment that it would take for Lucky's to be a meaningful contributor to Kroger overall and the efforts that it would take, we just didn't think it created a good return for the investments that were needed to be made relative to that. So it was really driven by narrowing our focus and the additional requirements to make it something that would be meaningful to Kroger. I don't know, Gary, you've been more on a day-to-day basis involved, anything you want to add? Gary Millerchip : I don't -- I think you characterized it well, Rodney. I think the only thing maybe to build in the second part of the question, I -- we do believe that as we get better connecting on fresh and continue to evolve the strategy around natural and organic, obviously, we're providing a far more comprehensive level of experience for that customer than ever before and continue to do more of that as we continue to build out the strategy around freshness and connecting with our loyal customers.  We do believe that there's still a role for the small format store. I think it's certainly proven. And I think it's still probably to be proven in the industry about what is the right model for a smaller format store and how do you make that economic model work and how do you connect with the customer in a way that drives the right value on those smaller shopping trips as well. So we still believe and continue to look for opportunities. And obviously, our Walgreens pilot continues to provide an opportunity to learn how to continue to build a strategy that has a small format presence in there. But I do think it also demonstrates your comment that it's hard to figure out that small format model and to make it work effectively. Operator : The next question is from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Charles Cerankosky : Been looking at the Thanksgiving sales and how customers were spending, trading up. Can you talk about what that might mean for the Christmas selling season later this month? W. McMullen: Yes. Thanks, Chuck. If you look at quarter-to-date, our identicals would be pretty similar to where we were in the third quarter. The balancing of it is significantly different than the last few years because, obviously, there's 1 less week between Thanksgiving and Christmas. If you look at the way how customers spend their money, we continue to see obviously strong on people trading up, strong performance in wine, cheese, all those types of categories, and we would certainly expect that to continue to stay consistent through Christmas as well. So we really expect the business to continue where it is through Christmas. Obviously, if you look at January of next year, it's really the SNAP cycling, the SNAP impact would affect the kind of the numbers that we've provided for guidance. Charles Cerankosky : Related to customers trading up, is that what you're trying to do when you invest in the customer experience? Prepared food strikes me you're making investments there. But are there other things we should think about? W. McMullen: Yes. It's fascinating because the customer is trading up both in terms of buying bigger package size. So what we find is when people are tied on budgets, they go to smaller package size. So we see people trading up there. We see people trading up to products that's better for you, natural and organic category. Prepared foods would be an area that we see people continuing to trade up for, and it's an area where we've focused a lot of attention on how do we get better. We view it as a huge opportunity to improve from where we are. And it's one of those things where we're just at the beginning part of that journey but certainly see customers very willing to pick up dinner at Kroger but do it with a Home Chef meal or something already prepared. Operator : The next question is from Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Antonio Tabet : This is Antonio Tabet taking over for Mike Montani. I just wanted to ask something on the 4Q comp outlook. You guys are obviously cycling SNAP in January. But I'm curious as to what you're seeing so far now with the whole rebrand going on.  And another follow-up to that is with the option of free pickup promotion going on right now until January 1, is there a possibility that, that stays? Or what are you seeing from that so far from the reception of customers? W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at the outlook for the fourth quarter, so far in the quarter, we're tracking pretty similar to where we were in the third quarter. So it's really up until the SNAP period, we really don't see changes there.  In terms of the pickup, free pickup option, we really aren't to a point yet of deciding whether to continue it or not. As you know, we've done it in several markets, and we're still early in the analysis. We -- the customer adoption has been stronger -- a little bit stronger than what we were expecting. But it's -- we're still at a point where we don't need to decide that yet in terms of whether we extend it or not. Gary Millerchip : Just to add, Rodney, so it is literally a few weeks obviously into -- since we announced the promotion. It's interesting. We're seeing a combination of new customers starting to use the service as well as existing loyal Kroger shoppers using the service more frequently as well. So we'll be using all of that data, as you might expect, to really analyze and evaluate. And that's certainly a factor that could also influence how the quarter plays out in terms of sales, which is another reason why we're trying to be clear about sharing the different moving parts that could still affect the quarter. Antonio Tabet : Okay. That's helpful. And just a quick follow-up on the digital side. You guys grew digital sales 21% this quarter. And just the way we're thinking about it, for the full year, we're thinking somewhere in the range of $5 billion to $5.5 billion digital sales versus 2018 value somewhere around the baseline of $4 billion. So that implies around 31%, 30% year-over-year growth. Is that somewhat reasonable to think of? Or is that an attainable target? Just want to get your color on that. W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at it on a run rate basis, the numbers that you shared would be very consistent with what we see. The other thing I always think is important to remember that I mentioned on our digital business and Yael shared it on a graph is the profitability of that business is maturing as we expect. And if you look at the early adopters on digital, the profitability of that customer was the same as going in store because we get such a higher share of their total spend. And we continue to see that maturity happen as well, which, for us, is something that makes it a sustainable model longer term as well. Gary Millerchip : Just one thing to add, Rodney, you said in your prepared comments and I mentioned it briefly as well, but I think we shared before that it really is the cycling of the Home Chef merger that caused the absolute percentage growth rate to show a declining trend. The underlying progress that we're seeing in customer engagement through Kroger pickup and delivery continues to be very strong and very consistent in the underlying results that we're seeing beyond the headline number. Antonio Tabet : Okay. And does that headwind continue to 4Q? Gary Millerchip : We've cycled that now. So it kind of -- it was partly through Q3, so you have kind of roughly half of it in the -- sorry, partly through Q2, so roughly half of it in the second quarter, and now it's fully cycled through in Q3. I think Yael may have shared, too, at the investor conference that we expect the growth year-over-year going into 2020 to be in that 20% range, consistent with what we shared this quarter. Operator : The next question is from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Kenneth Goldman : Rodney, thank you for the update on the quarter-to-date comp. Can you -- I know you probably will say no, you've never done this before. But just given some of the puts and takes for the fourth quarter, could you give us an update on sort of where you stand on your core gross margin quarter-to-date and your fuel margin as well? The reason I'm asking is there does seem to be a little bit of hesitation from some investors on your ability to sort of hit the high end of your guidance range for the fourth quarter. I just wanted to get your thoughts on that. W. McMullen: Yes. The -- I really would just go back to the comments that Gary made before. If you look at the underlying supermarket business, it continues to be strong. Identicals continue to be strong. A very good balance between cost reductions and investments in service and growth. The biggest swing would be the fuel margin. And even internally, the swings can be so much from day-to-day that it's really -- the value of where we are quarter-to-date, I don't think it can change overnight. And I remember the other day being in a market where in the morning, the margins were $0.40. In the afternoon, the margins were $0.15. It's that type of swing. But when you look at overall, it's a great return and it creates a lot of customer loyalty.  So -- and then the other piece is SNAP. So I don't know, Gary, if there's any additional insight. But to me, quarter-to-date, fuel margins are just kind of hard because it swings so much. Gary Millerchip : Yes, I think that's right. And just to put the number into context, I mentioned it briefly earlier, but the rate that we've been trending at year-to-date in that $0.29-ish range, $0.34 was the Q4 rate last year. That $0.05 range can make a $50 million difference in terms of profitability. So -- and obviously, we have a very clear strategy of how we connect with customers on fuel and making sure that we're in line with the market. And so it is one of those areas where it can have a significant impact, and hence why I appreciate it does leave a much wider range than we normally want to, I think, have in place for the fourth quarter, and it's certainly not a lack of confidence in what we're seeing in the underlying core business, but it's just -- with that level of uncertainty out there on something like rates, it's -- we felt it was prudent to leave the range where it is. Kenneth Goldman : I get that. And then my follow-up is, obviously, the government made some changes that are going to take some people in the America off food stamps, and it sounds like there's more of that coming. I'm curious, to what degree does your 2020 guidance factor that as a risk? Because, clearly, I think that if 700,000 or eventually some of the people think it will be closer to 3 million Americans get off food stamps, I can't say that as a positive for you, but I'm curious if there's any way to think about numerically how that might affect you? Gary Millerchip : Yes. Thanks for the question. Ken, obviously, it's something that we continue to watch very closely. And obviously, it's one of those things that we knew was a potential risk that's out there in the business, and we'll continue to watch it and evaluate. From our perspective, we really try and build the business model around being able to adapt to the circumstances, and we do believe that the model that we're creating and our ability to connect with customers and deliver an overall experience, the personalized pricing offers that we can generate that obviously are -- what we tend to see when customers have less dollars, they'll tend to gravitate more to own brand products, and you'll start to see some behavior shift. But because food is a nondiscretionary spend, usually, the customer is going to make adaptations that they have to, to be able to still buy the groceries that feed the family.  So from our perspective, it's certainly something that we contemplate as a risk as we think through how we'll continue to build our model and drive connection with customers. And it's something that we'll continue to adapt as we hear more and learn when and if the changes occur. But obviously, it's one of those things out of our control. And our focus is much more on how do we make sure we win the customer and continue to adapt strategy if some of those things were to hit us as a headwind in 2020. W. McMullen: Yes. Just a couple of additions. Obviously, the overall economy continues to be strong as well, which provides support. And when you look at SNAP, we would be less dependent on SNAP than many of our competitors would be as well. Operator : The next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Erica Eiler : This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. Firstly, just wanted to touch on price investments. I think last quarter, you called out, I think it was about 12 basis points of price investment. Just curious if there was a similar level of price investments this quarter. Gary Millerchip : Yes. I don't think we've typically called out specifically price investments. What I would say in terms of maybe a couple of thoughts, when you think about gross margin and what happened in gross margin during the quarter, the way that -- to sort of break it down, if you like, and I covered a couple of these points earlier, but if you exclude fuel from the results, we had a 24 basis point investment in gross margin, 9 basis points of that related to the out-of-period charge that we shared in the press release this morning, which essentially brings it down to 15 basis points. All of that gross margin headwind was essentially in the health and wellness space between Kroger specialty pharmacy and retail pharmacy. And as Rodney mentioned, our gross margin rate overall improved slightly when you exclude pharmacy from the core business.  So another way to say that is through the cost of goods savings that we were able to execute on during the quarter and the alternative profit growth that we were able to achieve during the quarter, which both support improvements in gross margin, we fully offset the continued price investments that we made in the business to drive the continued improvement in ID sales growth.  We are continuing to invest in price. As we've shared, I think, at the Investor Day, a lot of our focus this year is on really making sure that we're using our data to drive the price investments in areas that matter most to our customers. And some of those are going to be personalized offers and promotions, but some of it will also be in fuel rewards. And we mentioned in the prepared comments that while the profitability of fuel improved during the quarter, that was offsetting the supermarket business by an 8% growth in the amount of fuel rewards that we paid to customers to incentivize them to continue buying Kroger.  So it's a complex model in that sense, but we are continuing to invest in price. We're pleased with the way that customers are reacting to the investments that we're making because it's certainly allowing us as that one component of driving the identical sales growth that we shared in the quarter. But we're being very deliberate in balancing those investments with cost of goods savings and alternative profit growth. W. McMullen: Yes. The other thing that helped gross -- our shrink improved for the ninth consecutive quarter and warehousing and transportation costs improved as well. Erica Eiler : Okay. That's helpful. And then you briefly mentioned the prepared food opportunity. Could you maybe talk a little bit more about your vision behind the recently announced ClusterTruck partnership? And does this at all impact how you're thinking about Home Chef? W. McMullen: I'll start with the end of your question first. It doesn't affect us how we look at Home Chef at all. And if you think about our overall strategy on trying to serve the customer anything they want, anytime they want, anywhere they want, as you know, about half of food is food already prepared where people spend their money. And our market share there is significantly less than on the traditional supermarket business. And we really view that it will be a combination of Home Chef, something physical in stores in terms of meals ready to heat, ready to eat. And ClusterTruck is one of those where we think it's an addition to that overall ecosystem. Obviously, they have incredibly good technology. It's made to order quickly. And they will be able to leverage -- and we're doing -- it's obviously on a test basis, they'll be able to leverage some of our physical assets to be able to scale as well.  So it's really an additional piece in terms of how do we get the customers what they want, when they want it, the way they want it. And it's just an overall part of the overall ecosystem. And we just see the opportunity on food that's already prepared is a massive opportunity. Operator : The next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : So you said you've been encouraged by some of the early learnings from your expansion of the free digital pickup initiative. Can you give us a sense for how that initiative has impacted the P&L? So is the financial performance in line with what you expected? Gary Millerchip : Thanks for the question. Just recall, again, it is really early days in the journey with the promotion because we literally launched it a few weeks ago. And obviously, part of the modeling that you would expect us to do as we understand customer behavior is to look at -- as Kroger does on everything that we do, look at the longitudinal behavior with the customer and not just the individual transaction but how does that change the level of engagement with the customer, and that's going to need to happen over a longer period of time, as Rodney mentioned earlier.  Certainly, the early encouraging signs are, as I mentioned, we're starting to see new customers experience the service and start to engage in Kroger pickup that haven't before. We're also seeing existing Kroger pickup customers start to increase the frequency with which they use pickup service. And so a lot of the financial modeling that we will do will really be looking at those metrics over a longer period of time and saying, how does that play out in terms of the value it creates and how does it drive loyalty. And then, of course, as we talked a little bit about at the investor conference, we'll look at that in the context of the investments that we're making in the business and how does customer value this part of the experience versus other ways in which we're creating value across price investments, across fuel discounts and obviously through the experience that we're offering in the store.  So it's a pretty complex area. And certainly, we'll look at it over a longer period of time. We're seeing kind of the type of behavior we have expected to see, and it's certainly been positive. But it's really going to be a longer period of time before we could really evaluate the way in which it impacts the model with the customer. Michael Lasser : And just to clarify, Gary, you have assumed that in your 2020 guidance that you've provided, the test will be limited to 2019 so it will not continue into 2020 at this point. And then I have a quick follow-up. Gary Millerchip : We haven't really gotten into specifics around what our pricing strategy will be in 2020. As we talked about, obviously, I would think about it more much as you think back to the chart that I shared at the investor meeting in New York and how we're balancing the investments that we're making in the cost savings in the business. So we certainly have a clear view of how much we believe we want to invest in the business next year and how that will be supported by the $1 billion of cost savings that we're expecting. So if we were going to see the value in pickup driving more value in our model, it would be because either we expect it to drive higher sales and support the investment or we believe it would be a better way to invest the dollars that we think are important to driving value for the customer in 2020. Michael Lasser : That's helpful. My follow-up question is, Rodney, you've seen some pretty good momentum in your ID sales. There's probably a variety of factors that are contributing to that, including a healthier overall environment, being further away from some of the disruptive changes that you've made and better execution in the business. If you had to rank those factors and maybe any others in order of importance and magnitude that they've contributed to driving this improvement, how would you do that? W. McMullen: Yes. The -- great question, Michael. We would really view those as pretty equal. The other thing that we would add on top of that is really using personalization and data to be more specific for each customer individually. So like on -- the example I gave on fuel rewards, but it would be true for offers more than just fuel rewards, but really personalizing it to each household individually. And it's really all of those -- we would call it, the sum of all parts. It's all of that together that's creating and improving the momentum. It's not just one single thing. Operator : The next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Joshua Kamboj : This is Josh Kamboj on for Simeon. So sales trends are improving and the grocery gross margin increased slightly in the quarter. How sustainable do you think that combination is in the near term? And then more broadly, what changes in the competitive landscape would you need to see to undergo a deeper round of price investments over the next 3 years than what's currently embedded in your plan? Gary Millerchip : Yes. Thanks for the question. I think on the first part of the question, I would kind of draw back again to what we talked about at the investor conference. The way we think about the model going forward is, certainly, we're going to continue to invest in price. We're going to continue to invest in the customer experience because the long-term sustainable growth in loyalty, we think that's critical to our plan. What we're doing very deliberately is being very disciplined in how we're managing costs within the business, both cost of goods savings but also OG&A cost efficiency, which obviously was strong during the quarter. And then alternative profit streams continues to accelerate and obviously offset the gross margin investments that we're making as well. So I think we look at it much more of an overall ecosystem, if you like, is how do we use food as the foundation for customer loyalty, which drives the traffic. And then fuel obviously builds on that in terms of causing customers to shop more frequently. And then you think about the health and wellness business and alternative profit streams layering on together to create this overall ecosystem that drives customer loyalty and drives total profitability of the customer. And the way we think about it is how do we pull those levers together in a way that allows us to continue to invest and build loyalty. And we're using the different dynamics there around alternative profit and cost savings to be able to continue to invest. I think when we look at the market, certainly, obviously, there's always high competition. We expect that to continue. We always assume that within our model. And we feel very good about the plans that we're implementing around driving costs out and continue to grow alternative profit that we can make the investments that we need to, to be able to continue to grow customer loyalty. W. McMullen: Yes. I'd only add a couple of things. One, and Gary briefly mentioned it, if you look at continuing to learn to improve the customer experience, that provides support and ongoing support because we still -- we've made good progress, but we still see opportunities to get better.  The one area that I've been pleasantly surprised, as you know, we've been able to -- in 2018, we were able to take over $1 billion of costs out. We're on track to exceed that again incrementally in 2019, and we have plans to do that in 2020 as well. We continue to see good opportunity to take costs out. And when you look at all those -- both those pieces together and the free cash flow of the business is what gives us confidence and comfort in the comment that Gary shared at the investor meeting of TSR of 8% to 11% per year. Joshua Kamboj : That's helpful. And then in general, maybe you could just quickly touch on your price gaps versus some of your key competitors. Have they been widening or narrowing? And are you pretty happy with where they sit at the moment? W. McMullen: Yes. One of the things that we always think it's important, we're comfortable where we are, but it's always important to remember that customers decide where to shop based on freshness of departments, and we shared with you that our customer feedback on fresh is better than our big box competitors. We also have tons of personalized offers where a customer gets value, both in terms of individual mailings, individual e-mails and fuel. So it's all of those pieces together, and we feel good about where we -- our gap is. Operator : And the last question will be from Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America. Robert Ohmes : Just 2 follow-ups. Just the first on the LIFO increase, can you maybe just -- you mentioned procuring better, but LIFO is coming in higher than expected. I think in the press release, you guys called out grocery and dairy inflation. Is this all commodity driven? Or are CPG companies pushing through price increases? And then also, could you tell us what the inflation component of IDs was to the third quarter? So maybe just paint us a picture of what exactly is going on between all those things. Gary Millerchip : Sure. Thanks for the question, Robbie. Yes, it's an interesting question around LIFO and inflation because -- I'll maybe answer the 2 questions slightly differently. From an inflation point of view, as you know, we've shared before, we were assuming inflation in the range of 0% to 1% in the year. I would say it's trending slightly above that range. Actually, for Q3, I wouldn't say it's materially different than it was in Q2. There are a couple of categories like produce went slightly down and meat went slightly up, but nothing that would have been dramatic in terms of the overall change in inflation. So just slightly ahead of that 1% assumption that we had during the year. And actually, even though our LIFO charge forecasted increasing, we haven't really seen a dramatic change in the overall inflation rate across the categories. Everything I just said now I should probably caveat excludes fuel and pharmacy because those 2 obviously tend to have a different trajectory versus most of the food categories.  Interesting -- with LIFO, it is a one data point in time at the end of the year that we follow to support the accounting rules that are in place around making that LIFO adjustment. With the data point that we used in the third quarter caused us to, in following that process, believe that we should increase the rate and based on what it's telling us, that's why we called out the forecast is expected to be a headwind for the year. Of course, it's a noncash item, and it doesn't really impact the underlying performance of the business. But it will impact the earnings for the year based on the trend that we're seeing right now. But I wouldn't say it's a reflection of a major change in what we're seeing in inflation.  And obviously, we've shared before, when we see price increases, generally speaking, we'll be pushing back on them based on our knowledge of our own brand products and managing those. But where we are seeing them, we're generally looking to pass them on to the customer where it makes sense in those markets. Robert Ohmes : And just my other follow-up question. Just on fuel rewards, so you're expecting the CPG profitability of fuel kind of -- it sounds like flatten out next year. But it sounds like you're also going to be pushing harder, if I understood it, to kind of drive IDs more using the fuel rewards program. Just how should we think about that? And has there been a change in the responsiveness to fuel rewards that's got you interested in pulling that lever a little harder to drive IDs and penetrate loyalty more? W. McMullen: Yes. It really is an important part of our overall connection rewards on -- back to our customers for them shopping with us. I would say part of it is just continuing to learn new approaches that connect with the customer. So over the last, really, 6 to 12 months, we've been doing a lot of different types of tests and learns, trying to identify additional approaches that connect well with the customer. And it's really some of those are working, so we continue to scale that. How much we scale will really be driven by the degree of customer connection and how much does it drive the business. But customers still love an incredible great value for fuel. And we have so many convenient fuel locations. It really works out well for our customers and for our business as well. Robert Ohmes : And just, Rodney, how should we think about -- if you do keep growing it at 8% year-over-year, how will you fund that in 2020 if you're not going to be growing the profitability of your fuel business at the same rate? W. McMullen: Yes. Well, when we talk about fuel cents per gallon, we do not reduce that for any rewards at all. That doesn't show up there in terms of our internal financials. If you look at the overall guidance that we gave for 2020, we would be reflecting what we expect and plan to do on fuel rewards. But it really gets back to Gary's comment in terms of by -- improving identicals by this much, these type of process changes and getting costs out, what type of capacity does that give us to invest in service and price. And we would look at fuel rewards as part of that price investment because that's how our customers look at it.  Thanks, Robbie. We really appreciate everybody joining us today. And as always, thank you for your questions. Hopefully, you can get the sense from Gary and my comments that our underlying business results continue to be strong. Identicals continue to move in the right direction. We had good balance on investing in growth and cost improvements, and the free cash flow of the business continued to be strong, which positions us to get into a position of being able to buy stock back as well. So when you look at it overall in the quarter, feel very good about the underlying results and where we're headed.  As you know, before I end today's call, I always like to share a few final comments that's directed at our associates and how we live our purpose every day. Last week, I was visiting with store associates in our Collierville Kroger in Memphis. And a customer approached me when I was walking into the store, and he just wanted to share why he shops at Kroger. And he said -- first of all, I gave an example where one of our associates just gave incredible customer service. And then he said, \"Krogers, you always are great at donating food and funds to serve hungry families in our communities.\" And he specifically talked about his community. And to me, that reminded me of the privilege that we all have, to serve our customers and communities and each other, whether it's generously giving back to our neighbors in need or by being there for our more than 11 million customers that come into our stores and online every day, especially during this busy holiday season.  We open our doors and welcome everyone in as guests, whether they shop with us all the time or it's their first time shopping with us. Each celebration or tradition is unique, and we can be there for our customers when they need us most. Because we believe no matter who you are, how you like to shop or what you like to eat, everyone deserves to have affordable, easy-to-enjoy, fresh food. Each of us, all 460,000 associates, play an incredibly important role in bringing fresh for everyone to life. From stores to plants and distribution centers and our corporate and division teams, thank you for all you do every day and especially during this busy holiday season. I wish all of you and your friends and family happy holidays, merry Christmas and a happy new year. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Rebekah Manis, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Rebekah Manis : Thank you, Gary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our fourth quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question, if necessary. I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. W. McMullen: Thank you, Rebecca. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me to review Kroger's fourth quarter and 2019 fiscal year results is Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip. We were pleased with our 2019 results and improving trends in our supermarket business. As a result of our customer obsession and renewed intensity around operational excellence, we delivered our commitments for identical sales without fuel, adjusted FIFO operating profit, cost savings and delivered over $100 million of incremental operating profit through alternative profit streams in 2019. For the full year 2019, we delivered on the total shareholder return, or TSR, model that we outlined at our Investor Day and are positioned to deliver on our TSR model of the future, where you're using the power of Kroger's stable and growing supermarket business to create meaningful incremental operating profit through the alternative profit stream businesses, positioning our business for long-term growth that generates consistently attractive total shareholder returns. We continue to generate strong and durable free cash flow as reflected by the fact that the company has reduced debt by $1.1 billion over the prior 4 quarters and continues to increase the dividend to create value for shareholders. In total, we returned $951 million to shareholders in 2019. Our confidence that we can deliver even stronger TSR in the future is guided by our strong free cash flow and sustainable net earnings growth. By executing against the Restock Kroger framework, we are repositioning our business by widening and deepening our competitive moats. The 4 main areas of Restock Kroger framework, redefine the customer experience, partner to create value, develop talent and live our purpose, continue to be a top strategic priority for us. We're continuing to enhance the customer connection with investments in our competitive moats today, which are product freshness and quality, Our Brands and personalize rewards and our competitive moat of tomorrow, the seamless ecosystem we are building.  Fresh continues to be an important driver of sales for Kroger. Our fresh departments drive trips, loyalty and gross margin. Again, our produce department's strong identical sales for the quarter demonstrated how our store teams are focused on improving everyday execution in ways that are highly relevant to our customers. Our Fresh for Everyone campaign has been well received and is driving significant improvements in marketing effectiveness. It is also driving more trips to our seamless ecosystem in-store and online.  Our Brands achieved its best year ever, exceeding $23.1 billion in sales. We introduced 758 new Our Brand items in 2019, which helps drive strong year-over-year sales lift across our portfolio of brands. Since its launch in 2013, Simple Truth has become the leading natural and organic brand in the country with annual sales exceeding $2.5 billion in 2019. After identifying plant-based foods as a key food trend well before 2019, we introduced the Simple Truth Plant Based collection in 2019, and that launch is off to a strong start. The Simple Truth brand expanded into plant-based meats with Emerge grinds and patties in January. In only 1 month, these products ranked third in the category for the entire fourth quarter.  Our Private Selection brand eclipsed $2 billion in sales for the first time. The Kroger brand exceeded $13.7 billion in sales capitalizing on product development around key customer trends like global and regional flavors. Kroger continues to invest in digital as we build a seamless ecosystem that combines the best of the physical store experience with the digital customer experience for our customers. This is where customers are increasingly going to meet their needs. We know our customers value the greater convenience this provides, and our data shows it's an -- central component of driving overall loyalty. Digitally engaged customers not only drive growth through our digital modalities, they also help drive brick-and-mortar sales growth and share of wallet as well. Providing our customers with the ability to have anything, anywhere, anytime from Kroger sets us apart from a large segment of our competitors and will drive loyalty as well as our long-term growth and margin expansion. Our approach to partnerships is simple, but not simplistic. We think they work best when the 2 of us can do things together that neither of us could have done alone. We're roughly a year away from our first fully functional customer fulfillment center with Ocado in Monroe, Ohio. These facilities will accelerate our ability to provide customers with a seamless experience in a much more cost-effective way. We continue to be excited about the partnership. As we've shared previously, we believe Ocado's value as a partner is not just on its current capabilities, but also how quickly the company is able to innovate and serve rapidly changing consumer market. We continue to roll out our plan, and you should not assume just large facilities. We're designing a flexible distribution network, combining disaggregated demand and proximity of our stores, medium-sized facilities and large facilities. Our network will flex as demand matures, and the optionality will allow us to fulfill same-day or next-day delivery or pickup and the customer or store replenishment. As America's grocer, we continue to invest in our associates as part of Restock Kroger and have made significant investments in our associate wages. The investments Kroger is making in human capital is putting more money in our associates' product -- pockets today. Our investments in associate wages has increased Kroger's average hourly rate to $15 an hour in 2019. And with our comprehensive benefits factored in, our average hourly rate is over $20, benefits that many of our competitors don't offer. We are working hard to ensure that we have the right talent, teams and structure in the right focus areas in our core supermarket business and our alternative profit businesses. Our focus is on developing, training and promoting internal talent while, at the same time, hiring seasoned food industry executives to drive our retail supermarket business. In addition to investing in American workers and communities, Kroger is also leading the effort to end hunger in the places we call home and eliminate all waste across the company through our award-winning Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social impact plan. We made this bold commitment rooted in our purpose because we fundamentally believe that customers, associates and investors are increasingly choosing where to shop, work for and invest in companies that are purpose-driven and are actively making the world a better place. In these ways, Restock Kroger is the right framework to reposition our business to create value for all of our stakeholders, both today and in the future. Our focus on the strategic drivers is expanding Kroger's competitive moats and will drive total shareholder return in 2020 and beyond. And now I will turn it over to Gary for more details in the quarter financials. Gary? Gary Millerchip : Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. As I get started, I'd like to remind you of the key themes we shared during our Investor Day. Our model is built upon a strong and durable base driven by our retail supermarkets, fuel and health and wellness businesses. It begins with the customer and our obsession with increasing customer loyalty. Our intensified focus on execution and continued improvements in the value and experience we deliver for our customers drive increased identical sales without fuel across our store and digital ecosystem. To drive sustainable sales growth, we continue to invest in areas of the business that are important to our customers. This includes ongoing investments in talent, price, digital and store experience with an even greater emphasis on our competitive moats : fresh, Our Brands and personalization, plus the moat we are in the process of building, our seamless ecosystem. We also committed to be very deliberate in balancing these investments with disciplined execution of cost savings that simplify our business. Our full year 2019 results demonstrated clear progress towards delivering on this model and generating consistently strong and attractive total shareholder returns. Identical sales without fuel grew 2% in 2019. While first quarter results came in below our identical sales guidance range, the balance of the year came in at the top end of our guidance at 2.25%. Adjusted FIFO operating profit of $3 billion came in at the top end of our guidance range and demonstrated the strength of our multi-faceted business model with industry-wide retail pharmacy gross margin headwinds offset by strong fuel results. We demonstrated financial discipline by balancing investments in our customers, associates and the development of our seamless ecosystem with significant cost savings. This was evidenced by our improvement in OG&A rate of 29 basis points, more than offsetting our investment in gross margin rate of 23 basis points during 2019. We achieved over $1 billion of cost savings in 2019 on top of the $1 billion savings in 2018. We also have clear line of sight to $1 billion of incremental savings in 2020. These savings are being achieved through improved productivity and automation, elimination of waste, improved sourcing of goods for sale and goods not for resale and administrative efficiencies. We also achieved over $100 million of incremental operating profit through alternative profit streams in 2019 and delivered FIFO net operating profit growth within our 3% to 5% target range shared at Investor Day. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.19, the middle of our guidance range. Finally, we generated strong adjusted free cash flow, which we have used to pay down debt and bring our leverage ratio to within our target range and reintroduced share repurchasing in the fourth quarter. Now I'd like to provide commentary on Kroger's fourth quarter results. We delivered fourth quarter adjusted EPS of $0.57 per diluted share of 18.8%. LIFO charge for the quarter was $36 million compared to a LIFO credit of $10 million for the same period last year. This increase was driven by higher inflation in dry grocery, pharmacy and dairy. Our corporate tax rate for the fourth quarter was 18.2% compared to 20.8% for the same period last year. This decrease resulted from an increase in tax deductions. Adjusted FIFO operating profit for the fourth quarter was $758 million, up 20.7% compared to $628 million in the fourth quarter in 2018. Kroger reported identical sales without fuel of 2% during the fourth quarter. Several departments outperformed in our supermarket business, including produce, key beverage categories, pharmacy and natural foods. The underlying trends in the business was strong. November and December identical sales were consistent with third quarter performance. As expected, January was negatively impacted as we lapped incremental SNAP dollars in the market in January 2019 and we experienced milder weather this year. February bounced back nicely and performed in line with our expectations and slightly ahead of the trend in the third quarter and November and December. As a reminder, we do expect SNAP to positively impact the first quarter of 2020 as we lap a 15 basis point headwind from prior year. We expect identical sales in 2020 to improve over 2019 as we drive increased customer loyalty through fresh, Our Brands, personalization and seamless. Digital contributed approximately 75 basis points to identical sales without fuel. Kroger pickup and delivery continue to grow in a faster pace than our overall digital growth. During the 2019 holiday season, we offered a limited time free pickup promotion in select markets. Customers responded positively to the promotion, and we were pleased with our fourth quarter digital sales growth of 22%. Gross margin was 22.1% of sales for the fourth quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased 6 basis points. This increase resulted from improvements in cost of goods, accelerated alternative to profit streams and cycling of investments in the fourth quarter of 2018 partially offset by investments in price and personalization, continued industry-wide lower gross margin rates in pharmacy and growth in the specialty pharmacy business. Our associates continue to do an impressive job managing shrink, which improved in the fourth quarter compared to last year. This represents the tenth consecutive quarter of year-over-year shrink rate improvement. While retail pharmacy gross margin continued to be a headwind in the fourth quarter, retail pharmacy remains an important part of our strategy and continues to generate good returns and strong customer loyalty. OG&A cost as a rate of sales, excluding fuel and adjustment items, decreased 79 basis points in the quarter. Part of this was due to cycling of investments in OG&A made in the fourth quarter of 2018, plus broad-based improvements in Restock Kroger savings initiatives. We were pleased with our ability to deliver OG&A improvement above the level of gross margin investment as a rate of sales in 2019, and we expect that balance to continue in 2020. Fuel is an important part of our strategy to drive customer engagement. Our loyal customers received hundreds of millions of dollars in fuel rewards in 2019 in the form of price discounts at the pump. The average retail price of fuel was $2.58 this quarter versus $2.34 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin in the fourth quarter was $0.33 compared to $0.34 in the same quarter last year. Fuel is a great example of Kroger's sourcing teams continuing to improve buying practices. This allowed us to achieve improvement in fuel cost of goods in the fourth quarter. Alternative profit streams contributed an incremental operating profit of more than $100 million in 2019. Media and Kroger Personal Finance continued to be the primary drivers of growth. Brands continue to invest in Kroger Precision Marketing because we close the loop between media exposure and store and digital sales to make brand advertising more addressable, actionable and accountable. An annual survey by the Path to Purchase Institute gave us strong ratings for effective targeting, measurement, sales growth and ROI. Most recently, we became the first retail media platform to be awarded Platinum Certification by the Trustworthy Accountability Group for meeting guidelines to improve transparency and prevent ad fraud, malware and piracy. We're committed to being the most transparent media organization and making the entire digital media ecosystem a safe and effective investment for CPG brands. As Rodney mentioned, we continue to invest in our associates as a key part of Restock Kroger in a variety of ways, including investments in wages, training and development. We ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW covering associates in Memphis during the fourth quarter. We are currently negotiating with the UFCW for contracts covering store associates in Las Vegas and Houston. Looking ahead, we have several major negotiations in 2020, including contracts with UFCW for store associates in Dallas, Food 4 Less associates in Southern California and Fry's associates in Arizona. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We strive to make our overall benefit package relevant to today's associates. Our financial results continue to be pressured by health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions, which represent many of our associates, on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. We continue to generate strong free cash flow and are being very disciplined in how we deploy it to deliver strong and attractive total shareholder returns. We are committed to investing in the business to drive profitable growth, maintain our current investment-grade debt rating and return excess free cash to investors via share repurchases and a growing dividend. In 2019, Kroger reduced our net total debt by $1.1 billion, bringing our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA within our target range. We also returned $486 million to shareholders in dividends and repurchased $400 million of shares in the fourth quarter of 2019 under our $1 billion Board authorization. At our Investor Day, we committed to continue to apply a rigorous and disciplined approach to capital management, and we are focused on ensuring our capital projects deliver strong returns. Consistent with our approach in 2019, the majority of our investments in 2020 will be allocated to driving profitable sales growth, improving productivity and building out our supply chain and seamless ecosystem. We also committed to effectively manage our portfolio of assets to improve ROIC over time. As part of our review process in the fourth quarter, we recognized an impairment charge relating to the planned closing of 35 stores across the footprint in 2020. This is reflected in the $52 million of transformation costs recognized during the fourth quarter. As we have shared with you previously, Kroger made the decision to divest our interest in Lucky's Market in the third quarter of 2019, and we took the appropriate impairment charge based on the information available at that time. Subsequently, the decision was made by Lucky's Markets to file for bankruptcy in January, which led us to fully write off the value of our investment and deconsolidate Lucky's Market from our consolidated financial statements. This resulted in a noncash charge of $174 million in the fourth quarter. Kroger maintains liabilities associated with certain property-related guarantees that will result in Kroger making payments to settle these over time. These items have no effect on net earnings per diluted share or adjusted free cash flow guidance for 2020. Turning now to guidance for 2020, building on our momentum in 2019, we continue to expect identical sales without fuel of greater than 2.25%. We also continue to expect adjusted FIFO operating profit of $3 billion to $3.1 billion and adjusted net earnings per diluted share to range between $2.30 and $2.40. Looking at the cadence of EPS growth in 2020, we expect the first quarter to be below our annual EPS growth range of 5% to 10% as we cycle real estate gains in the first quarter of 2019. Overall, I'm encouraged with the momentum created in 2019, which provides a solid platform from which to deliver on our commitments in 2020. Now I'll turn it back to Rodney. W. McMullen: Thanks, Gary. Before we invite your questions, I'd like to say a few words about the coronavirus. From a financial standpoint, it is too early to tell the effect on our business. It is not included in our guidance. And while it is obviously very early for this public health event in the United States, we're not seeing anything so far that would cause us to change our guidance. From a business preparedness standpoint, we have established an internal task force that has activated our pandemic preparedness plan with a focus on our customers, associates and supply chain. We generally believe that we have limited supply chain exposure in China as the majority of the products we source is domestic. We certainly feel for those in America and around the world who have been affected. The health and well-being of our associates, our customers and our communities is Kroger's top priority. Always being there for our communities is part of our heritage and especially in times of uncertainty. We believe everyone deserves to have access to affordable fresh food. Returning now to our business results, I want to stress that Restock Kroger is the right strategic framework to deliver both on our 2020 guidance and to position Kroger for sustainable growth and total shareholder return. Now we look forward to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Global Research. Robert Ohmes : A couple of quick ones. First, just on ClickList with the kind of fee waiver and the response to that and maybe some color, what happens after you put the fee back in and also what are your sort of intermediate term thoughts on keeping a fee versus getting rid of it like some of your competitors seem to have. That would be one. And then just 2 other quick ones, just the pharmacy expectations for 2020 and the fuel profit assumptions in your guidance for 2020. Maybe just give us some color so we can think about those things in our modeling. W. McMullen: Thanks, Robbie. As Gary mentioned, when you look at the digital promotional offer on the waived fee, overall, we're happy with what we learned. We did engage with some new customers. I think it's important to remember that this was a test among many, many tests that we continue to do. And overall, what we're focused on is really how to create a seamless experience. In terms of going forward, I wouldn't be comfortable sharing our exact plans because, obviously, that will share -- tell our customers -- our competitors, excuse me, what we're planning to do. And the customer behavior was consistent with what we expected. They were happy and the results since then have been consistent with what we expected as well. And overall, I think it's always important to remember what we're really trying to do is build up a seamless experience. And what we find is the better job we do on creating that seamless experience creates a deeper and deeper loyalty strategy. In terms of pharmacy expectations and fuel, Gary, I'll let you answer both of those. Gary Millerchip : Sure. Thanks, Rodney. Thanks for the question, Robbie. So yes, as you think about the model for 2020, I'll maybe refer back a little bit to some of the things that we talked about at Investor Day. We very much look at the overall customer ecosystem across our food and grocery business, retail pharmacy business and also the fuel business as an overall how do we manage those multifaceted parts of the model. And I think if you look at our performance in 2019, as I've said in some of the prepared comments, we feel like it's a really good demonstration of how we're managing that model where, really, the pharmacy headwinds that we saw in 2019 were fully offset by the fuel benefits that we saw. And then the sort of foundational food and grocery business was pretty stable within that environment. I would say that as we look towards 2020, we'll be managing the business in a very similar way. When you think about our overall guidance for 2020, we're essentially expecting that ecosystem to be relatively stable overall, and alternative profit will drive us towards the operating profit growth that we've shared for the full year. Within that guidance, we do expect that pharmacy will continue to have some headwinds, nothing to the extent that we saw in 2019. We think the gross margin structural challenges will continue in 2020. But the team has done a great job in continuing to look for opportunities to take out costs where they don't add value for the customer, our associates and looking for ways to improve our cost of goods where we have control over those items. And so we would expect to see less of a headwind, albeit still somewhat of a headwind from pharmacy in 2020. We would also expect fuel, obviously, to start to normalize. And so probably something of a headwind there within the overall model. And really, the way that we cycle those will be through the strength of continuing to improve our ID sales in the core and the $1 billion of cost savings that I talked about overall within the model. So overall, we think about it very much as all those moving parts creating a relatively stable core business from an operating profit point of view in 2020 and alternative profits driving the growth in the year. W. McMullen: Yes. Gary's last point on the incremental profit from alternative profit is an important part, I think, to remember as well. And we -- as we shared in our guidance, we expect it to range somewhere between $125 million and $150 million. Operator : Next question is from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Kenneth Goldman : Two for me. First, I wanted to -- I know it's way too early to -- for you guys to sort of quantify the coronavirus impact, but that won't stop me from trying to ask. And I appreciate -- I would appreciate any help you can give. Can you at least directionally talk about whether it's been a benefit so far in the last couple of weeks? I mean Campbell's Soup yesterday talked about how they are experiencing better orders in the last week or so from some of their customers. We've certainly read about stock-outs of water and so forth. At least directionally, do you think it's been somewhat of a help so far? Or is it really just way too early to say for sure? W. McMullen: Personally, and I'll let Gary if he disagrees, I just think it's way too early to say for sure. And the key thing is we -- as I mentioned before, is we want to make sure we're there for our communities, our customers and our associates. And the comments that Campbell's and others have said, certainly, we would see an increase in volume in certain categories. And if you think about a lot of the basics and things that people would need to be able to keep and maintain their health and those things, but it's so early in the process in the United States. And the only pattern that we would have any idea on how to look at it would be China because that is the most -- first developed in terms of going through the impacts. And our -- all of our teams, our stores, our supply chain team, our procurement folks are incredibly focused on making sure that we stay in stock on those critical items in partnering with CPGs and our own supply chain to replenish that. I don't know, Gary, anything you'd want to add to that? Gary Millerchip : Yes. I would completely agree with your comment, Rodney, as I think it's really too early for us to really have a sense of how customers' overall behavior will change and what the impact will be as the situation obviously evolves in the U.S. market. I guess just to build on a couple of points, Ken, with the data points that we do see today. As I mentioned in the prepared comments, February was generally in line with what we've expected for the period of the first month, if you like, around new year. So we didn't see anything dramatically different from what we would've expected during that time period. Certainly, the trend has improved over -- slightly over what we saw in Q3 and November and December. So we will have to see that after January was a month that we knew would be a tough one to cycle. And as Rodney mentioned, in the last few days, I think you've seen more in response to the media activity and some of the advice out there in the market of customers starting to spend more on things like water and hand sanitizer, hand soap, paper and then some of the -- maybe the box dinners and soups that you might expect just based on the guidance that's been given to consumers in the market. So there's certainly been heightened activity in that regard. But how that plays out and how it impacts the overall shape of the way customers behave and shop, I think it's really that should be. And I think in the last few days that I would say there's anything different than we would have seen versus what we expected. And how that plays out over a longer period of time is really, I think, impossible to tell. Kenneth Goldman : Totally understand. I appreciate that. Can I ask a very quick follow-up? Depreciation and amortization seem to be a little bit higher than most people were looking for this quarter. Gary, can you help us understand or think about how to model that for 2020? What numbers do you have in your internal models? Gary Millerchip : Yes. Sure. And thank you for the question. Yes, it's -- it is an area, Ken, where we saw some lumpiness during the year. Part of that is to do with the fact that as we've been dynamically changing our capital allocation, the average life of some of the investments that we make in technology look different from some of the traditional investments that we would've made in a traditional store remodel or a new store opening. We're still investing in those areas, but the mix is certainly changing over time. As that normalizes out, we would be looking at a range of 3% to 5% as a sort of an annualized increase in depreciation to kind of give you more of a big picture perspective on how to think about 2020, if that's helpful. Operator : The next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : I want to go back to the comments, Rodney, you made about Ocado and the flexibility to just -- to not just assume large facilities. If you can just talk more about the flexibility you guys have to, I guess, have different facility sites and just how you guys are thinking about that flexibility going forward. W. McMullen: Yes. As we've talked about before, we really do believe it'll end up being a combination of our physical stores, sheds that are small, medium and large-sized. The ones that we've announced so far have been all large sized. But over time, Ocado continues to spend significant money in R&D and continues to push. So we would expect it'll be a combination of store-based model, smaller-type facilities and bigger-type regional facilities, and Ocado will be a critical partner in that overall ecosystem. And by having those combined, it will also allow us to have the best cost of goods coming into the various sheds and using the total assets that we have today. So we feel really good about the pieces of the puzzle that we're putting together. And we really think the -- and it will support the ability to do both same day and next day. And what we find is, in some cases, customers like same day, some things they like next day. But -- and we're excited. We're really looking forward to the facility in Monroe opening and the second facility in Florida will open soon after that. Rupesh Parikh : Great. And then just one follow-up question. So you -- I guess, you announced the closing of 35 stores. Is this the right way to think about the cadence going forward? Or just maybe just walk us through, I guess, the rationale for these store closures? Gary Millerchip : Sure. Thanks for the question. It's -- I think I've talked a little bit about it at the Investor Day and then in the prepared comments. What we're really focused on is taking a step back and making sure as we think about how the overall portfolio of assets are performing, how do we make sure we're really setting ourselves, that we're making the right investments to accelerate and grow the business but also looking where we have opportunities to optimize the portfolio and to drive, obviously, ROIC over a period of time. I would say that this is very much a sort of a stand-alone review that we've taken a step back and said -- look at stores where -- and the average -- to give you some context around it, the average store age is about 28 years old. So these are, in many cases, older stores. They're geographically spread across the countries. There aren't sort of particular markets that it's focused on. It's very much more about looking at our portfolio and really making sure that we see where the customer is going, where we invest our dollars to really drive and support our customers and how we continue to evolve the whole ecosystem that Rodney referred to in his opening comments, just making sure that we're really being disciplined in investing where we see the future growth in the business. And so it's one of those things that just as part of as we manage the business and look for ways to continue to improve and optimize, we're looking to be very deliberate in making those decisions. Operator : The next question is from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Kelly Bania : Wanted to just talk about just alternative profits and really where trade promotion dollars ended up for the year. And with -- in your conversations with CPG, just curious if you're finding that there is not any cannibalization or plans for cannibalization as this matures? And just updated thoughts there. W. McMullen: Yes. I'll talk broadly, and then I'll let Gary get into the specifics. It's one of the reasons that we partner on the media side of the CPGs and one of the things that we have a very open and transparent relationship going both ways. So we don't want to spend money on Media if the CPG isn't getting a return for it. And that was the reason why we thought it was so important to get the Platinum Certification from the Trustworthy Accountability Group, is that we want to make sure that when we invest the CPG money, that we're able to show that they get a return for it. And by making sure that people are getting a return, that's the best protection, to make sure that they're just not moving trade dollars over. And we tell the CPGs it doesn't do us any good if you just move the trade dollars over. What we're trying to do is provide something that you can't get in the marketplace from a media standpoint. We're getting great feedback from the CPGs. We have incredibly high retention rate, and many CPGs continue to expand the amount of money they spend with us. Gary, I'll let you get a little bit more into some of the details. Gary Millerchip : Sure. Thanks, Rodney. And obviously, I would agree with everything you shared there. I think one of the key things that the team is focused on is really working collaboratively across Stuart Aitken's team, that leads the Media group, and then Joe Grieshaber's team, that leads our merchandising capabilities, to make sure that we really are managing all the moving pieces together. And I would say we feel very good around how those relationships are working to make sure that we're capturing the dollars and really helping support our CPG partners to grow their business effectively through the work that we do in the merchandising group and also through the alternative profit streams with the Media business. I wouldn't say that we see anything that's causing us to believe that as the way this is being managed, that they are very much discrete buckets that are generally being allocated to particular activities. We feel very positive about the progress that we're making there on how we see -- I would probably characterize it as how we see a shock in cost of goods and how it flows through to the gross margin. I would say it's one of the reasons that we called it out in the quarter earnings release of -- we certainly continue to invest in price and personalization for our customers. But the combination of cost of goods benefits and alternative profit streams fully offset that in terms of the impact on gross margin and part of the reason why we were able to see a solid performance on gross margin during the quarter. Kelly Bania : Okay. That's very helpful. And maybe just since we were on gross margin a little bit, maybe just another question on pharmacy. So it sounds like the headwind there should moderate a little bit from last year as we look into 2020. But what is the -- what is your long-term expectation there? Does this ever go away? Or is this kind of the new norm? Gary Millerchip : I think certainly, our assumption in the model is that we expect -- continue to see pressure in certain parts of the way the pharmacy business is structured. Our focus is on really making sure that we're continuing to improve our operation in a way that ensures that, in addition to all the great things that our pharmacy business do for us today around driving overall customer loyalty and delivering a great experience in the store for customers, that we continue to evolve the way we think about the business model. I mentioned some of the things in one of the earlier comments around how we're taking costs out of the model where that makes sense and doesn't create value for our associates working in that part of the business or for our customers. We've launched a number of new services, like the Kroger's pharmacy program that allows us to be able to deliver more value for the customer, but also to be able to influence more of the dynamics of how the profitability works in the marketplace and to really deliver more value for customers through that program. And then I think the third piece that we talked a little bit about, I think, on a previous call is we truly believe that the power of our data and the overall relationship that we have with the customer potentially opens up opportunities to develop new revenue streams in connecting food to how we deliver our health and wellness services in the store, so thinking about the trend towards food as medicine and how can we connect those relationships even more clearly to help our customers live and eat more healthily when they want to do that, but also to connect into the health care system and helping to take out some of the cost and complexity in that model and generate new revenue streams. W. McMullen: We are actively testing where food is actually written under a prescription and helping people live healthier. And when you look at all of that together, we continue to have a great scripts count growth as well. And we really think it's our pharmacy teams and their connections with the patients that's creating that deeper relationship. And as Gary mentioned, when you look at the overall ecosystem, half of health care costs can be affected by the way people eat, and we really believe, with our data, we have the right to help people eat better. Operator : The next question is from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Edward Kelly : My question around -- my real question for you is if -- Rodney, if we take a step back and just assess the last year and the evolution of the state of the business, your business, your stock's going from $30 to $20 back to $30. This quarter -- it was in the quarter, right, FIFO EBIT, even if you back out the onetime -- the benefits of onetime laps was up, right, despite a tough fuel lap, but you had some tough quarters in core grocery. I guess have you finally turned the corner here? What level of confidence do you have? I'm just kind of curious as to your big picture thoughts on sort of like the last year how things have evolved and your confidence level on the business and where it is right now. W. McMullen: Thanks, Ed. If you look at overall, as we mentioned before, if you look at the momentum during the year, we felt really good about the progress and momentum during the year, and that's in terms of identical sales and if you look at the operational execution. I think Mike and the whole team really have done a great job on those areas. We're really taking care of the customer. We continue to aggressively invest in the seamless experience. And if you look at the alternative profit, it continues to come as we expect it would. So that's -- when you look at all those things together is what gave us confidence to continue to support the guidance we gave in November on EPS of $2.30 to $2.40. We expect the business to continue to generate good cash, strong free cash flow while, at the same time, continuing to aggressively invest capital in a seamless experience. So when you look at all those things together, as you know, the last 2 or 3 years, we've been working hard on transforming our fundamental business model, and we feel like we've made significant progress on that and continue to invest in the future from a digital experience. So we're excited about where we are. We're even more excited about where we're headed. Edward Kelly : Okay. And I just wanted to ask you a question about share repo and expectations for 2020, especially Q1. I mean Q1's a big cash flow quarter. It seems like share repo is back on. Historically, you bought a lot of stock in Q1. Just thoughts on how we should be thinking about that in the coming years for modeling? Gary Millerchip : Yes. Thanks for the question, Ed. So obviously, I mentioned a little bit around this in the prepared comments. We committed that as we continue to see strong free cash flow generation, which is a core part of our total shareholder return model, we are committed to continuing to buy back stock as part of the model. As you know, we had a $1 billion authorization from the Board. And as long as we continue to deliver on the performance of the business that we expect and generate the strong free cash flow that we've guided to during the year while also maintaining our debt-to-EBITDA ratio within that target range to support our commitment to our investment-grade rating, we would expect to be continuing to buy back stock within the overall authorization that we have. I would say that the way that we're approaching it is very much in a structured way. We're not specifically trying to time the market in some way. It's much more based on a grid approach to how we determine and look at the intrinsic value of the stock. And then we'll put a grid in place to make sure that, over time, if there are opportunities to buy back, we will certainly be executing on that plan throughout the year. Operator : The next question is from Christopher Mandeville with Jefferies. Chris  Mandeville: I guess as it relates to some of the expense control measures found within Restock, can you flesh those out a little bit more specifically? How much of this is related to possibly some head count reductions at the store level or even some reductions in store hours for that matter? Reason why I bring it up is because we have been hearing certain regions have seen some layoffs at the assistant store manager level, and there's been some reductions in hours of operations. So maybe you could just kind of talk about that a little bit and then to what extent maybe some of those reductions are being offset by wage increases that you're putting forward to your associates. Gary Millerchip : Sure. Thanks, Chris. Yes. So as we mentioned in some of the prepared comments, that the quarter 4 result obviously did include some cycling of increased investment that we made in Q4 2018. And so some of that is certainly expected, and I know we guided to that as part of what we shared in the EPS expectations when we shared what we thought the cadence would look like throughout 2019. We're really seeing the improvements across a broad wave of activity across Restock Kroger. I listed out many of them in the prepared comments, whether it's -- some of the biggest areas would be in goods not for resale as example, where we're sourcing products better and we're managing to really make sure that we're finding opportunities to be more efficient in the way that we're buying and joining the dots across all the different pieces of procurement across the organization. Certainly, we're leveraging technology and automation to make sure that we're taking work away where it doesn't add value for the customer. A good example of that might be in cleaning, where it's something that can be done more efficiently and allow our associates to really focus on serving the customer and doing work that the customer really values. And then of course, we did announce last quarter that we did make some structural changes to really simplify the work in our divisional offices to make sure that we're, again, putting our associates and talent closer to the customer in these key store management roles and, at the same time, reducing duplication in work so they can make decisions more quickly and respond and serve the customer more effectively. So I think we feel very good about it. It's a good balance across the way that we're managing the cost base. Certainly, as we look at the performance of our stores, one of the things that -- building on maybe Rodney's comment to the last question that was asked around confidence in the model, we're very excited about as we see our stores continue to execute at a higher level and continuing to deliver improvements in the fresh experience, the friendly experience and our in-stock position and how we're delivering on Kroger pickup. So we're very focused on making sure our stores are in a good place to be able to deliver on the experience that we know our customers are looking for. And some of those are the reasons why we feel confident as we're guiding to higher ID sales in 2020, because of the great work our store associates are doing in delivering for our customers. Chris  Mandeville: Okay. And then just my follow-up, it's maybe a little bit too early. But in the areas where we've seen some of the natural organics, not named Lucky's shutter and then with Ahold Delhaize pulling Peapod out of the Midwest, have you realized any benefits already? Or maybe you could just talk about how you're planning to be positioned to capitalize on the share being up for grabs? W. McMullen: Yes. Thanks, Christopher. If you look at natural and organic, it continues to be one of the highest growing areas. And we really think it's something that, over the years, our teams have done a great job on continuing to make sure we have the most recent product things on trend. The example that I talked about in the prepared remarks in Simple Truth and plant-based. So for us, we're incredibly excited about natural organic. It's grown above the company average for several years, and we would expect it to continue to do that. Anytime market share becomes available, we're going to fight for making sure that we get our fair share plus some. And we certainly feel good about what we're getting, and we'll continue to focus on taking care of our customers. Because when our associates are able to take care of the customers, it turns out really well. Operator : The next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : Rodney, you mentioned on the free pickup that you were pleased with some of the customer satisfaction, I think. Can you tell us, was it a reasonable assumption? Or did you assume that your business would accelerate offering that feature? And was that the case? Did your overall business grow because of it? W. McMullen: Yes. It did pick up. And as I mentioned, we did get some new customers. Overall, it was kind of what we expected it to be, and we did it so we can continue to learn. And I think the thing that's important is at any point in time, we'll probably have 20 or 30 different types of tests going on. And the key will be identifying those tests, when you put them together, that create something that's not easily that a competitor can duplicate and it really creates something new for the customer. One of the things that's always our strength is our incredible strength on fresh product. And our customers tell us that relative to our big traditional competitors, we score very well. And we think things like that and the service that our associates provide is equally as important. Simeon Gutman : Yes. And I guess just checking on some websites, it looks like it's still being offered. I think you may have mentioned you're not going to divulge if that's your strategy. And just tied to it, Ocado, broadly. And I guess, it's early but you still haven't opened the first facility yet. But do you think in this world of click and collect and delivery, that this Ocado model, you could be able to offer these services for free as a -- as table stakes and still have pretty good economics on doing those type of fulfillments? W. McMullen: Yes. When you look at Ocado and the combination of our physical -- existing physical stores, we think we'll be able to offer the customer an incredible customer experience and convenience based on what they want. The fee part won't be -- isn't the major driver of making the economics of that work or not. And whether we charge a fee or not will really depend on what's the market opportunity. But Ocado is incredibly efficient. Operator : And our final question today is from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : Rodney, if you think about the $1 billion of cost saves, right, and the core business ex alternative profit being flat, so that -- you think about that $1 billion going to cover normal inflation in OG&A and then investments in the business, would you think that would be a 50-50 split in terms of how that $1 billion get spent? And then do you think there's another $1 billion more or less in 2021? W. McMullen: Yes. The -- I'd say -- I'm trying to do the math in my head as you were asking the question. If you look, we would certainly believe there's opportunities in 2021. We really haven't done the in-depth analysis for -- to be able to say what do I think the specific number is. One of the things that I think is interesting on cost saves and process changes, the more we learn how to do it, the more that we find. So we would be very excited about continuing to identify opportunities to simplify our business and take complication out, which every time we do, it saves money. In terms of -- we would -- I don't know that we would say 50-50. I guess what we're looking to do is making sure that we deliver the TSR that we outlined in November at our investor meeting. And the cost saves, along with our -- and continued improvement from our seamless customer experience, in terms of that becoming a bigger tailwind, all of that together is what allows us to be confident and make the commitments we did on TSR. I don't know, Gary, any specifics that you would want to add? Gary Millerchip : No. I would agree with your points, Rodney. I think in terms of the cost savings, as you mentioned it, for me, many of the opportunities that we still see out there are around how we can continue to use technology more effectively and really simplify the design of the work to make it easier for our associates to be successful in the role. And that often means, as you know, John, is we're often reinvesting them in other areas of the store experience and the digital experience. So that net-net, it doesn't necessarily translate through to a total saving in cost because what we're often doing is redeploying those savings into new ways to either improve the experience or to meet the customer where they're at. So it is -- back to Rodney's comment on the what's inflation versus what's incremental is a little bit more difficult as the world's get blurrier around what are the minimum expectations of the customer and where things like average wage going in the marketplace. John Heinbockel : And then just lastly, maybe just talk to how the Walgreen partnership is ramping up on the procurement side. And does that become a much bigger driver of part of that $1 billion later this year and even bigger next year? Gary Millerchip : Yes. Thanks for the question, John. It's -- yes, that's a good call. Actually, that would be very true in the way you characterized it. So we've really just then got off the ground with that part of the partnership. As you know, the retail test that we have in market have now been going for some time, and we've been pleased with the progress there. And we continue to develop our thinking around how to connect more detail with the customer and fulfill on that convenient shopping experience. The group purchasing organization part of it is very much in its infancy stage. We've just started to work on where the opportunities are there, and that would certainly be part of the tailwinds into 2020 and beyond in driving more efficiency and cost savings. W. McMullen: Thanks, John. As always, before we end today's call, I'd like to share a few final comments directed to our associates and how we live our purpose every day. To our associates, thank you for everything that you do for our customers, communities and each other every single day, every single hour of every day. You truly make a difference. This difference makes people's lives better, and this was obviously incredibly evident earlier this week when the devastating tornado touched down in Nashville. I'm always amazed and proud to hear stories of our associates pulling together in the aftermath of events like this. One story that was shared with me is some customers that didn't have protection came to our store to seek shelter inside of our dairy case when the tornado hit, and that's just one example. And the thing that's even, to me, more impressive is what our associates do, what you do when your own families are personally impacted and to all the work that you do to ensure our stores are open and serving our communities. As I mentioned earlier on the call in regard to the threat of the coronavirus, always being there for our communities is part of our heritage. This is Kroger at our best, when we come together and uplift our customers, communities and each other. Thank you for what you do for everyone every day, and thank you for joining our call today. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Rebekah Manis, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Rebekah Manis : Thank you, Gary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I'm joined by Rodney McMullen, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Gary Millerchip, Chief Financial Officer, and they will be providing an update on the business and discussing first quarter results. This is obviously an unprecedented time, and we are taking the additional step of providing more details on current business trends this quarter, so our prepared remarks may run a little longer than normal. But before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings, so Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our first quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Rodney McMullen. W. McMullen: Thank you, Rebekah, and good morning, everyone. A lot has happened in our world since the last earnings call. We've had to adapt quickly to a new way of life. The COVID-19 pandemic and the most recent instances of racial injustice have changed our country in unmistakable ways, most profoundly the devastating loss of life and livelihood that has affected so many Americans. During the crisis, Kroger has been guided by our purpose and our values. I am proud of our associates who stepped up when we were called to be there for our customers, communities and each other. We are proud of the heroic and dedicated associates who are on the frontline, serving our customers when they need us most. As America enters the next phase of the pandemic, we know that our associates will continue to rise to the challenge, delivering Fresh for Everyone and helping our customers, communities and America emerge even stronger. I am proud of the measures that we've taken across our business to safeguard and support associates, customers and our communities. During the pandemic, our priority has been to provide a safe environment for our associates and customers with open stores, e-commerce solutions and an efficiently operating supply chain so that our communities have access to fresh, affordable food and essentials. Since March, the company has invested more than $830 million to do just that. This includes the $150 million Thank You Pay for our frontline grocery, supply chain, manufacturing, pharmacy and call center associates, which are providing -- which we are providing to acknowledge their hard work and dedication to maintaining safe, clean and stock stores. We are pleased that our associates will share in the company's success with today's second installment of Thank You Pay. We continue to invest in, support and protect our associates. We are providing emergency leave to associates. We are offering free COVID-19 testing to our associates. We have increased the contribution to our Helping Hands Fund to $15 million to provide additional financial support to associates experiencing hardship due to the virus. Our work to safeguard associates will continue as long as the pandemic threat exists, and we are proud that Kroger was named in Forbes Magazine as leading 1 of the top 10 employer responses to the pandemic. As part of Kroger's commitment to help America reopen safely, our Kroger Health team stepped up to help expand access to testing as a partner in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Public-Private Testing Partnership. Through this initiative, we have tested more than 82,000 patients in 15 states. We also offered free check cashing for stimulus, unemployment and social security checks. Since launching this service, we've cashed more than 229,000 checks, totaling $244 million. Kroger has learned and continues to learn a lot while keeping our stores and supply chain open and serving America during the pandemic. The company's total COVID-19 incident rate is tracking meaningfully below the markets where we operate, and our overall accident rate is the lowest we've ever recorded. I'm incredibly proud of how our associates have worked together to practice creating a safer environment for our customers, communities and each other. We've been able to share our loans with other businesses and communities to help as they begun to safely reopen through a resource guide we created called Sharing What We' ve Learned : A Blueprint for Businesses. Our blueprint includes actionable recommendations and learnings that we've applied as well as what we've learned through regular interaction with governments, health departments and with business leaders in other countries, including Italy, Singapore and China, all of which were ahead of the U.S. in terms of the pandemic cycling through their countries. Under Restock Kroger, we have made significant strategic choices over the last several years to transform our business model and to redefine the customer shopping experience, partner for customer value, develop talent and live our purpose. We've invested aggressively in technology to establish a seamless digital ecosystem, and we've made incremental investments in fresh, our brands and personalization. These investments in our competitive motes helped Kroger build business momentum in the second half of 2015, which continued through the start of our first quarter, even before the first phase of the pandemic began in our operating markets in earnest in March. The benefits of the changes that we've been making to our business model were accelerated by COVID-19. For example, our heavy investments in technology enabled us to reliably sustain the incredible almost overnight increase in demand for our pickup and delivery services. Here are other examples of how the pandemic accelerated Kroger's transformation. As you know, we introduced Kroger's brand transformation campaign, Fresh for Everyone, late in 2019. We believe that no matter who you are, where you're from, how you shop or what you like to eat, everyone deserves to have access to fresh, affordable food. This has proven to be even more important during these times. In the initial stock-up phase of the pandemic, customers purchased a lot of paper, cleaning products and center store nonperishable items to fill their pantries. As the first new normal phase began to set in, marked by preparing for extended time at home and often with children, our fresh departments took an even greater relevance as more and more customers turn to fresh produce and proteins as staples of home-cooked meals. Fresh will continue to be an important driver of sales for Kroger as demonstrated by our fresh departments, including meat, seafood and produce, generating strong identical sales in the quarter. Our brands had a great quarter as well and grew 21.1% driven by significant growth across our 3 largest brands. Having identified plant-based foods as a key trend well before 2019, the Simple Truth Plant Based platform continues to deliver strong growth, growing over 32% in the first quarter. In this way, by consistently delivering both value and innovation, our brands will remain one of our most powerful competitive advantages. Because of the continued economic anxiety, we are still offering our customers value through personalization and promotions, leveraging our mailers, mobile app, website and weekly ads. We continue to offer promotions throughout the quarter with a focus on single-item purchases. Kroger began investing in digital several years ago to build a seamless ecosystem that would deliver anything, anytime, anywhere. As a result, we have over 2,000 pickup locations and 2,400 delivery locations, reaching 97% of our customers with a seamless customer experience that combines the best of our physical stores with digital. These investments were especially timely as customer adoption of pickup and delivery grew significantly during the pandemic. And because of our existing ecosystem, we were able to respond quickly to further expand and enhance our e-commerce services. We were able to quickly offer and promote in demand no-contact delivery and low contact pickup services. We expanded and improved contact-free payment solutions like Scan, Bag and Go and Kroger Pay. We took several steps to support the higher volume of pickup orders, including hiring additional e-commerce associates, adding more order pickup slots and increasing the frequency of communications with customers. We also began testing a grocery pickup-only location in Cincinnati. All of this contributed to a 92% sales growth in digital channels in the first quarter. In April and May, the sales grew in the top triple digits. We continue to invest in and constantly improve our e-commerce capabilities. Our partnership with Ocado remains an essential part of our evolving seamless ecosystem. Our customer fulfillment centers will accelerate our ability to serve customers seamlessly and in a more cost-effective way. Earlier in June, we identified 3 new regions : the Great Lakes, the Pacific Northwest and the West for placement of our high-tech sheds. When operationally, these facilities will collectively create more than 1,000 new jobs with the potential for hundreds of additional career opportunities. As we've shared previously, we believe Ocado's value as a partner is not just its current capabilities but also in how quickly the company is able to innovate and rapidly -- sort of rapidly changing consumer markets. We are designing a flexible distribution network, combining disaggregated demand and proximity of our stores, medium-sized facilities and large-sized facilities. You can see this strategy taking shape in the new automated CFCs which will span a range of sizes. The new facility in the West will measure 300,000 square feet. The new facility in the Pacific Northwest will measure 200,000 square feet, and the facility in the Great Lakes region will measure 150,000 square feet. The varying sizes demonstrate the flexibility of the Ocado fulfillment ecosystem to best serve the respective markets. Our network will flex as demand matures and the optionality will allow us to fulfill same day or next day, delivery or pick up and customer or store replenishment. Kroger has been investing to raise wages for our frontline associates for the last several years. As part of Restock Kroger announced in 2017, Kroger is increasing associate wages incrementally by approximately $800 million per year through the end of 2020, and this is $300 million more than the original plan. As a result of this continuing investment, Kroger has increased its average hourly rate to over $15 per hour. And with comprehensive benefits factored in, our average hourly rate is over $20 per hour, benefits that many of our competitors don't offer. Because of these investments our -- and our established human capital management processes, we were able to expediate our hiring processes in early March to shorten the time between application and employment. Onboarding new hires an average of 72 hours and focusing onboarding on culture and safety, we were able to not only generally protect associate jobs in the face of record unemployment, we also created new jobs and new career opportunities for more than 100,000 workers nationwide. Our expediated hiring and onboarding processes also enabled us to focus on associate and customer safety. We were able to direct immediate support to the expansion of Kroger pickup availability as well as an enhanced cleaning and sanitation practices in our stores and facilities where we needed the help the most. Many of those new roles were bridge jobs providing laid-off workers with a stable job opportunity while furloughed from their previous jobs, many of whom are now returning -- starting to return. Additionally, I'm pleased to note an extension of our human capital commitments. We contributed an additional $236 million to multiemployer pension plans in the first quarter. This investment will help stabilize future associate benefits. We work extremely hard to ensure that we have the right talent, teams and structure and the right focus areas in our core supermarket business and our alternative profit businesses. Our focus is on developing, training, promoting internal talent while simultaneously hiring seasoned food industry executives to drive our retail supermarket business. Kroger remains committed to diversity, equity and inclusion with our workforce. We are creating more opportunities for our associates to openly share their thoughts, feelings and experiences with discrimination and for our company and leaders to more deeply and deliberately listen. We will continue to educate and show our leaders and associates how to be more empathetic, supportive and aware of our own unconscious biases so that, together, we can build a better and more inclusive Kroger. COVID-19 also accelerated our commitment to integrated ESG or sustainability practices. What we are seeing in our communities during the pandemic confirms that our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste mission is more relevant than ever. During the pandemic, more than 80 million people in the U.S. lost their jobs and applied for unemployment benefits and/or food assistance. Many more families are struggling to put food on the table today. Kroger is using our philanthropic dollars and foundations to support our food banks and other key partners. Additionally, we are now accepting SNAP/EBT benefits as payment for our pickup service, allowing more customers to access fresh, affordable food through e-commerce. We also implemented a dairy rescue support program for farmers. Many farmers and producers did not have a market for their products as foodservice, hospitality and restaurants remain closed. We operate 17 dairies around the country and are uniquely positioned to offer our processing capabilities. Manufacturing and dairy procurement teams rapidly scaled a program to rescue surplus milk donated by Kroger's dairy cooperative suppliers and processed by Kroger-operated dairies and directed it to food banks and families in need. Kroger is a trusted brand, and our #1 priority is to be there for our customers, associates and communities. We understand the transition to a new normal will not happen uniformly across the country. As America enters the next phase, we're using our own customer insights and monitoring the impact of affected global markets to help us continue meet customer needs. And now I'll turn it over to Gary for more detail into the quarter financials. Gary? Gary Millerchip : Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Before discussing results for the quarter, I also want to thank our associates for their dedication and all they are doing to serve our customers and communities during this time. The pandemic brought unprecedented challenges, and I'm extremely proud of how our teams responded as America relied on Kroger as a trusted resource for their food and essential needs. As a result of the pandemic, we have seen elevated demand across our physical stores and digital channels. Our data insights show customers continue to value the convenience of our physical locations and the ease of our seamless ecosystem. As many of you know, we outlined our Restock Kroger transformation plan in 2017. And as part of that plan, we made the strategic decision to invest in digital. These investments allowed us to quickly add much needed capacity to serve our customers by scaling the foundational capabilities we have built and continue to develop. The outcome of these efforts has been a meaningful uplift in sales across all digital modalities : Kroger pickup, delivery and ship. We made significant investments of more than $830 million in the quarter to reward associates and safeguard associates, customers and communities during the pandemic. We also contribute to $236 million to multiemployer pension plans to help stabilize future associate benefits. Even with these significant investments and accelerated digital growth, we were pleased to achieve an improvement in FIFO operating margin, excluding fuel and adjustment items. We firmly believe that our ongoing investments will help Kroger emerge stronger, and it's clear from our recent customer data insights that our competitive modes, fresh, our brands, personalization and a seamless ecosystem, are even more important as a new normal begins to emerge in food retail. Now I'd like to discuss our quarterly results in more detail. We delivered an adjusted EPS of $1.22 per diluted share. Kroger reported identical sales without fuel of 19% during the first quarter. Unprecedented demand for products across grocery and fresh departments led to these strong results. Sales were broadly based across all retail divisions and remained heightened throughout the quarter as customers adjusted to the new restrictions and started preparing and eating more meals at home. Leading into the pandemic, our sales were strong, building momentum from the second half of 2019, February identical supermarket sales, without fuel, were ahead of our internal expectations. During the last few days of February, we started to see a shift in customer behavior as shoppers started stockpiling, and that trend accelerated into March with identical sales of approximately 30%. Sales remained elevated in April and May, both up approximately 20% as customers continue to eat more at home. In the first few weeks of the second quarter, we are starting to see some changes in demand with sales growth becoming more balanced across the store as state restrictions have started to ease. Customers remain focused on health and safety and are still stocking up but to a lesser degree than during the shutdowns. We are also starting to see a return to some splurge and impulse buying. Customers are still cooking more at home, even with the easing restrictions and identical sales, so far in the second quarter, are trending in the mid-teens. We do expect sales to continue to taper as the quarter progresses. Digital sales grew 92% and contributed slightly over 3% to identical sales without fuel. New customer engagement with our pickup and delivery services spiked significantly during the quarter, and we have been encouraged by early customer repeat usage. Digital sales in the second quarter remain elevated, up triple digits in the first 3 weeks. We continue to invest in digital and offered a fee-free pickup promotion to provide more value for our customers in ways that are most relevant at this time. We were also excited to announce several new enhancements to our digital customer experience, including the launch of our check-in on arrival option for pickup customers and the launch of contactless doorstep delivery. Adjusted FIFO operating profit for the first quarter was $1.45 billion compared to $957 million in the first quarter of 2019. Gross margin was 24.3% of sales for the first quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased 44 basis points due to sales leverage related to shrink, transportation, warehousing and advertising costs. Our associates continue to do an impressive job managing shrink, which saw significant improvement in the first quarter compared to last year. The OG&A rate increased 51 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items. No adjustment was made to this number for COVID-19-related costs. As previously mentioned, during the quarter, Kroger made the decision to contribute an incremental $236 million to multiemployer pension plans. Excluding the incremental pension contribution, fuel and adjustment items, the OG&A rate improved 10 basis points. Rent and depreciation, excluding fuel, decreased 37 basis points due to sales leverage. We do expect some COVID-related costs to continue beyond the first quarter as we continue to invest in associate and customer safety as well as support heightened digital demand. We also made the decision to delay certain Restock Kroger cost-saving initiatives to allow our associates to focus on our most important priorities : safety and stocking shelves. We have now started to reintroduce the delayed initiatives while also maintaining our commitment to associate and customer safety. We still expect to achieve the vast majority of the targeted $1 billion of savings in 2020. Fuel remains an important part of our strategy to drive customer loyalty. We saw a significant decline in gallons during the quarter as with the national trend. We remain well positioned within our markets due to our fuel procurement practices and market-leading reward program. The average retail price of fuel was $2.13 this quarter versus $2.62 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin in the first quarter was $0.48 compared to $0.23 in the same quarter last year. And as a result, fuel profitability was a major tailwind in the quarter. For the remainder of 2020, we expect fuel profitability to be a headwind compared to prior year as we cycle margins from 2019, and gallons continue to be impacted by COVID-19. Kroger's alternative profit model is built from a platform of leveraging supermarket traffic and data and is expected to achieve profit growth in 2020. During the first quarter, Kroger Personal Finance experienced lower transactions as customers purchase less gift cards, money services and lottery. Customer activity has started to improve since April as states have reopened. And while we would expect this trend to continue, KPF profit is expected to be lower than our original expectations for 2020. Media experienced a slowdown in late March and April as campaigns were paused to refocus messaging on store and employee safety and certain in-store programs were impacted by stay-at-home orders. Our Media business rebounded strongly in May, and the strength of our digital sales growth has created significant momentum for Kroger Precision Marketing, which is now on track to achieve 50% growth in 2020. We remain confident in the significant potential of alternative profits, especially given the continued growth in traffic across our store and digital ecosystem. Despite short-term headwinds due to COVID-19, we continue to expect alternative profit to be a major accelerator of our model in the future. As Rodney mentioned, we continue to invest in our associates as a key part of Restock Kroger in a variety of ways, including investments in wages, training and development. We ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW covering associates in Food 4 Less California and South Carolina during the first quarter. We are currently negotiating with the UFCW for contracts covering store associates in Las Vegas, Roanoke, Little Rock and Houston, as well as Dallas meat clocks.  Looking ahead, we have several major negotiations later in the year, including contracts with the UFCW for store associates in Charleston, West Virginia and Fry's associates in Arizona. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality, affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We strive to make our overall benefit package relevant to today's associates. Our financial results continue to be pressured by health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions which represent many of our associates on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way which will help create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. Kroger's financial model has proven to be resilient throughout the economic cycle. We continue to generate strong free cash flow and maintain strong liquidity. We are committed to investing in the business to drive profitable growth, maintaining our current investment-grade debt rating and returning excess free cash to investors via share repurchases and a growing dividend over time. We are being disciplined in how we deploy capital, and all aspects of our capital plan are being evaluated to make sure that our investments position Kroger for long-term success post COVID-19. We still expect total capital expenditure of between $3.2 billion and $3.4 billion in 2020. Kroger's net total debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio is 1.81 compared to 2.54 a year ago. This is below our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Kroger held temporary cash investments of approximately $2.3 billion as of the end of the quarter, reflecting improvements in operating performance and significant improvements in working capital. We expect working capital to improve for the year, although not to the level experienced in the first quarter, which was inflated by the extraordinary sales growth due to COVID-19. Given the uncertainties that remain related to COVID-19 and the outlook for the remainder of 2020, we believe it's prudent to maintain financial flexibility in the short term. We remain committed to our dividend and share repurchase program. And in the coming months, we will also be evaluating the optimal use of any excess free cash flow, consistent with our previously stated capital allocation strategy. Turning now to guidance for 2020. The COVID pandemic has dramatically changed the outlook for food retail, and we continue to monitor, evaluate and adjust our plans to address the impact to our business. There are still many unknown factors related to the long-term impact of COVID-19 that could influence our financial results for the remainder of 2020, such as continued investments to help our customers and associates; uncertainty surrounding consumer behavior, restrictions and what will be the new normal; and potential long-term shift in customers eating more food at home. In recognition of these factors, it's difficult to predict specific outcomes. And as such, Kroger is not reaffirming or providing new 2020 guidance. While we do expect to exceed the outlook shared in our April 1 business update for identical sales without fuel, adjusted FIFO operating profit, adjusted EPS and adjusted free cash flow, the company is not able to forecast the extent of such upside for the reasons mentioned. As we continue to proactively adjust our plans in response to the pandemic, we remain committed to investing to ensure a safe environment for our associates and customers, and we will also continue to use our customer insights to invest in delivering greater value for customers in ways they value most and that build loyalty. Kroger's financial model has proven to be resilient throughout the economic cycle. We remain confident in our business model as well as our ability to generate strong free cash flow and achieve sustainable and attractive total shareholder returns. In the second quarter, we expect identical sales, excluding fuel, to continue at elevated levels, although tapering from the trends we've experienced so far in the quarter. We expect EPS growth in the second quarter to be in the mid- to high single-digit range with tailwinds in the supermarket sales, partially offset by continued investments and fuel headwinds. As the longer-term impact of COVID-19 becomes clearer, we are committed to providing more clarity on our expectations for the remainder of the year. I'll now turn it back to Rodney. W. McMullen: Thanks, Gary. I am so proud and deeply grateful for our 0.5 million associates who step forward to be there for our customers and communities when they need us the most. In true Kroger spirit, they have risen to the occasion to each challenge presented with a strong spirit of agility, determination and service to meet the needs of our customers, and these are the exact skills that will ensure the company will remain relevant to our customers in the future. As I shared when we first began this call, we quickly had to adapt to a new way of life. We continue to make progress on the underlying business, even with the recent customer demand tailwinds. We are confident that Restock Kroger has allowed us to reposition our business and to create value for all our stakeholders prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Now we look forward to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : Gary, I just want to go back to your -- I guess your -- what you just said about Q2 EPS growth, mid- to high single digit. I think you said mid- to high single-digit EPS growth. Can you just help us understand more some of the headwinds there getting to that level of growth? Gary Millerchip : Yes. I think the biggest factor, Rupesh, would be that -- I mentioned it earlier, but just to maybe to give a bit more color on fuel for quarter 1 and how we see quarter 2 potentially shaping up because that would be the -- I think the biggest factor in the numbers. Overall, as I mentioned earlier, when we think about the supermarket business, we're expecting continued strong sales momentum, and we feel good about the ability to manage the margin and the investments that we'll continue to make as a result of COVID-19. I think the biggest factor and the difference between the 2 quarters as we look at the guidance for the second quarter, in the first quarter, fuel has been a significant tailwind for us overall despite the fact that gallons were significantly lower through COVID. As we start to look at Q2, and we'll be cycling margins from Q2 last year, and even though the fuel trend in gallons has continued to gradually get better every week, we're still seeing a decline in year-over-year gallons. And the current trend would be in the sort of mid-teens range of negative growth in gallons, which is consistent with what's being seen in the market. So as we look at the fuel performance in Q2 and what we see today, we're thinking that could be a headwind of anywhere between $50 million to $100 million. So it would be important to think about that as you're thinking about the guidance that we shared for Q2 because that would be the -- I think the primary factor that would despite the continued growth and improvement in performance that we'd expect over the original budget in the supermarket business. Hope that helped. Rupesh Parikh : That's great. And then -- okay. That's really helpful. And then just one follow-up question. So just on e-commerce. So as you guys look at -- obviously, you have the partnership with Ocado. How does what you've seen recently change your, I guess, your e-commerce plans or investments going forward? W. McMullen: I love the question. And if you look at the strategic decisions we've made over the last several years, it highlighted those decisions really paid off in the current environment. Our digital and delivery and pickup business in the last 2 months grew triple digits and continues to grow at that. And to have the ability to grow at that kind of level that quickly, just so proud of the whole team in terms of the foundations that were already in place but also the stores and all the other parts and supply chain on being able to supply and hire people and support that. So we fundamentally believe the long-term trend will continue where people will continually depend more on e-commerce. We certainly have seen that be accelerated. We don't think it will stay at the higher level where it is today permanently, but we do think, fundamentally, the growth has been accelerated and will be higher than where it started before COVID-19 and then grow from there. One of the things that's incredibly important is all the pieces tied together, including Ocado, will allow us to continue to grow and improve our profitability of that part of the business. As you know, when a customer first switches to online, it typically takes 3 or 4 years before that customer's profitability is the same as when they shop in the store. But what we find is we get a significantly higher share of that customer's total household spend. And there isn't anything that we've seen that wouldn't cause us to believe that the new e-commerce shopper doesn't feel that way, and a lot of those customers are telling us they intend to continue to shop more e-commerce than before, and we would expect to get a higher share of their business. We've also seen a lot of customers new to Kroger come and use our delivery and pickup business, and we're seeing nice repeat purchases from those customers. So all those things cause us to feel good about the things we have in place and feel even better about Ocado and the other pieces that we're working on going forward. Operator : The next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : I was going to ask something different, but I wanted to ask you, Rodney. You just made the comment, it takes about 3 to 4 years to achieve the same profits. Do you mean that on an ongoing basis? Or is that lifetime value because over 3 to 4 years, I've purchased enough through the digital channel. And therefore the -- I guess the profit becomes equal? Or on a go-forward basis after year 3 or 4, the variable cost or the actual basket economics of each become even? W. McMullen: It's each customer's household. So if you look, obviously, when they first switched to e-commerce, we're spending the labor to pick their order, where before that, the customer spent that labor. What we find is, over time, we continue to get more efficient with our picking operations on picking an order, and the customer spends more money with us, so their total spend increases. So what we find is every -- you'd have to look at every single customer separately. So the customers that first started shopping e-commerce 3 years ago, they're to the point now where their profitability is the same as before they went to e-commerce, but we're getting a higher percentage of their spend. And looking forward, we believe we'll be able to continue to reduce the cost to serve that customer. A new customer starts day 1, so you have that headwind until we are able to earn more of their total household spend. And what we find is we're able to do that. Simeon Gutman : Yes. That's helpful. And my follow-up is on the 92% growth in the first quarter. Did you say the mix? Or are you surprised by anything about the mix between delivery and pickup? And then anything you can share on how it impacted gross margins or margins broadly? It sounds like if you picked up a lot of new customers, it would be in a pretty dilutive position for that lifetime of the customer, but anything you can share on it, please. W. McMullen: Yes. If you look, delivery was a higher growth than pickup, especially during the peak of the COVID cases. As areas have reopened and companies have reopened their offices and things like that, the growths are starting to get more similar. Gary, on the growth, I'll let you answer the growth and the changes there. Gary Millerchip : Sure, yes. Thanks for the question. I would say that the way that we see the digital customer behavior flow through in the P&L, it's not a meaningfully different mix in terms of overall pass-through in gross margin rates. Rodney's point earlier, generally, we see customers increase their spend. The basket size increases, and the mix is pretty consistent. The area that would have impacted gross margin would have been more in the fact that we run the fee waiver promotion. So that would have certainly been a headwind in the gross margin category. Really, where we see the bigger impact on digital is Rodney's earlier response around the incremental labor that's involved in picking the order. So if you think about the pass-through rate that we might see on a traditional sale through the store, which we've talked about historically being the 15% plus range, it would be significantly lower than that on the equivalent basis because you've got the incremental labor associated with those sales. So it would be more of an impact in the OG&A rate than it would be in gross margin when you think about the quarter. Operator : The next question is from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Edward Kelly : Yes. Just, first, a follow-up and then a real question. As we think about Q2, could you just help us out? What are you assuming for IDs in the quarter? What are you thinking about from a continued COVID cost perspective? And how do we think about gross margin relative to what we just saw in Q1? Gary Millerchip : Yes. Thanks for the question, Ed. There's a couple of parts for that, obviously. I think in terms of sales, as we shared in our brief prepared comments on sales, we're obviously watching the trends very closely. Part of the challenge is it's very hard to know obviously exactly how we expect the customer behavior to return back to whatever a new normal becomes. We certainly expect as states have reopened to start to see a gradual return to some level of lower food eaten at home, but we do think that's going to be more gradual than a specific stair step-down. We're starting to see some change in Q2, as we mentioned during the prepared comments, and -- but it's not really sort of a specific step-down when states have reopened. It's much more of a gradual process as you start to see customers returning to some level of normal behavior. I would also say it's not very consistent. It's not as though states that reopened first are seeing the bigger step-down. It's relatively more tied to when states first experienced a major outbreak of COVID from what we can see and also depending on how aggressive the spike in sales were in that market when the outbreak first happened. That's tending to more correlate with the gradual change in shopping behavior. So we're watching it very closely. We are starting to see visit frequency pick up a bit. We're seeing more of the departments that might be more splurge I mentioned earlier growing like daily baker and specialty cheese and floral, but it really is a gradual process. And I think we still say it's too early at the moment, only a few weeks in to know. So we're expecting it to be a gradual step-down from where we ended Q1 and the trend that we shared so far in Q2. And obviously, we're watching it very closely and maintaining flexibility to make sure we're winning every dollar from a customer perspective around how we make sure we're continuing to grow market share and grow share of wallet. From a gross margin perspective, obviously, we haven't gone into a specific guidance around what we would expect to see there. We continue to invest in promotions, as Rodney shared, and we certainly expect that to become more and more normal as we go through the year now that the supply chain is starting to normalize, but there are still going to be some areas where it will be more difficult to promote where there are still some overhangs of supply issues in certain categories. On the COVID-related costs, it really -- if you think about breaking down the total OG&A expense in Q1, it's really 3 buckets I would kind of categorize it into. The first would be the COVID-specific costs around the $830 million that we talked about, obviously, in the press release and the prepared comments. The majority of that was around rewarding our associates and making sure that they shared in the success of the quarter. And then there were also some costs associated with incremental labor for cleaning and PPE equipment. We'd certainly be expecting some of those costs to continue as we go through the year with safety being the top priority. We're also obviously investing in labor in supporting our digital growth, and we'd expect that labor to continue as we continue to win that customer and make sure that we're winning their overall loyalty. And the third major cost in OG&A, obviously, with the pension contribution, which we wouldn't be expecting to repeat. So I think it's really in OG&A. The cost that will flow through are going to be the safety and cleaning costs that we'd expect to continue to be investing in and the incremental labor associated with supporting digital growth going forward. W. McMullen: One other comment, Ed, on the first part of your question, and it's hard to assign specific numbers and specific numbers just for the second quarter versus third quarter, fourth quarter and even 2021. But when we talk to customers, we -- our customers still tell us they plan to eat more meals at home than before. When talking to customers about when their children return to schools, we still have a significantly higher percentage of families telling us they plan to make breakfast for the kids to take to school and lunch for the kids to take to school. All of those things in terms of what customers are telling us, we would expect there'll be more meals eaten at home or prepared at home that obviously will help support growth as well. Edward Kelly : I understand the reluctance to really give ID guidance. But the only thing that I would say is that it does matter if it's mid- to high single-digit EPS growth on a double-digit ID versus a single-digit ID from an investment perspective. So to the extent that you can help out with that, that I think would matter to how people are looking at your story. The other thing that I needed to ask about is the pension contribution because I think people are getting kind of hung up here. The $200-plus million contribution that you made this quarter, I believe that relates to that group of 4 meat plants that you essentially kind of control and take in-house. Is that right? Gary Millerchip : That's right. So think of it as it's a green status plan. It's over 80% funded, so there's not an obligation for us to make that payment. But obviously, it's something that we're committed to making sure that, long term, we're securing that future liquidity of the plant. And especially during times like this when there's market volatility, sometimes there could be pressure on those plans to have to liquidate assets to be able to make contributions, and we wanted to make sure that the plans were not put in that risk. So we decided to basically invest those dollars now to protect the future. And obviously, over time, that will derisk the need for us to have to invest, but it wasn't a requirement to make those payments. Edward Kelly : Okay. So it sounds like that's pretty funded at this point, so maybe we don't see that type of contribution going forward. The other plans that you have is you have a -- you're obviously in the traditional map, right, with other grocers, which is negotiated, and there's no real reason for you to make one-off contributions like this into those plans. Isn't that right? Gary Millerchip : That's correct. Yes. The only way that we would approach those examples would be if we identified an opportunity to be able to pull away from the multiemployer plans and bring them into the same way that we run that UFCW plan if there was a -- if it made sense for us to do that from an investor and associate perspective because we could derisk the future liabilities and be able to take more control of that potential exposure in the future But we have no obligation on those, unless we were to make -- take that action like we did with the plan you described earlier. Edward Kelly : Right. And your defined benefit plan, the corporate one, is frozen now, right? Gary Millerchip : That's right. Exactly, yes. That's fully funded. Operator : The next question is from Karen Short with Barclays. Karen Short : Just following up on that. So the actual -- can you give us an update on what the actual liability is on the multi-employer pension in dollars pretax? And then with this contribution that you just made, is there -- do we adjust -- and I know you haven't given the annual P&L and cash impact of the multiemployer pension contribution for many years. But -- are we think -- like when we think about modeling it, beginning 2Q, does that actual expense dollar amount come down based on the contribution you just made? And then I had a totally separate question. Gary Millerchip : Yes. So it depends on which piece of the plan, just to clarify, Karen, you're talking about. So as Ed mentioned a moment ago, we have a multiemployer plans that we separated and we now manage internally. And as I mentioned earlier, they would be in the green status, so there'd be no obligation for us to be making those payments, but we're obviously looking to get them over time a fully funded status and to minimize the risk to associates. So think about that as it's minimizing. If returns weren't where they needed to be, it minimizes the risk as of us having to make contributions in the future and ensures those pension plans are in a strong position for our associates. The multiemployer plans that we're a participant in but we don't have a current obligation to fund beyond the annual contributions that we're making through our negotiated contracts with the unions, that would be an exposure as of the end of last year and as we reported in the 10-K, $2.3 billion or $1.8 million after tax. And they're ones where, over time, we would certainly look at if there are options to figure out different ways to structure our arrangements so that we can address those liabilities, but they would be very specifically defined and ring-fenced transactions that we would obviously share publicly in the future, if we were to decide that was the right thing to do. Karen Short : But as we think about the actual expense on the P&L beginning in 2Q, I know, again, you don't guide to that anymore, but how should we think about that? Gary Millerchip : Expense related to what, I'm sorry, Karen, I'm not sure I'm following. Karen Short : Well, the multiemployer expense. Gary Millerchip : Yes. So we -- as I mentioned, we would have pension expense related to our multiemployer plans that we pay into as part of the negotiated contracts with the unions. And obviously, where we need to continue to fund the plan that's internal, we'll make those contributions when we need to. But we -- obviously, that can vary significantly. But most of the most of the pull -- if I call it, pull forward may be a potential liability in the future, it doesn't relate to what we would do in 2020. Karen Short : Okay. Got it. And then just looking at digital, in terms of your overall digital, would you just be able to give us what your actual percent of sales in digital was in 1Q? And then what the split was between -- I guess, click-and-collect and third party, which I would say is mostly Instacart? And then the last question I had was just on your cash balance of the $2 billion, just thoughts on that. W. McMullen: Well, if you look in terms of overall, digital would have been, I don't know, probably 6.5% or 7% of the total company. It would have been predominantly pickup versus delivery in terms of the mix, but the percentage growth was higher on delivery. So -- and if you look at -- the other thing on delivery, a lot is delivered directly to people's homes, either through FedEx or UPS. And that's basically the similar number is what is delivered via Instacart and other services. On the other piece, Gary, I'll let you answer Karen's other. Gary Millerchip : Yes. Thanks, Rodney. Sorry, we were all looking to get the digital number for you there, Karen. Can you repeat the second part of the question? Karen Short : Oh, just on the cash balance. I mean you guys haven't had a cash balance like that for a while. So thoughts on where you're at in terms of deployment of that? Gary Millerchip : Yes. So as I mentioned a little bit in the prepared remarks, we -- certainly, we're thrilled with the cash balance that we generated during the quarter. Part of that does reflect the improved operating performance. Part of it was a significant improvement in working capital. We want to make sure that, obviously, we maintain maximum flexibility in the short term, just with some of the uncertainty that still exists in the market. And we also want to make sure we understand how much of the working capital benefit will continue because we do believe we've made strong progress on working capital over the last really 12 months to 18 months as we've continued to look at ways to free up cash flow, but some elements of that will be inflated, just because of the higher sales in the first quarter and the way our working capital cycle works. And some of it is also related to the CARES Act, where there's a delay in certain tax payments as part of the way that the CARES Act was structured. So we would expect as a result of all of that still to generate incremental free cash flow this year. As we go through the next couple of months, we're really going to focus on what do we think is the optimal way to use that cash flow consistent with our overall capital allocation strategy that we shared with you in our Investor Day in November. So think about is we'll look at are there opportunities where we could continue to invest in the business to drive longer-term growth. We'll certainly be looking at are there any reasons to restructure any of the pension future MEPP liabilities that would allow us to take that potential liability and risk off the table longer term. And then, of course, we'll also be looking at how might we redeploy that cash to our shareholders consistent with our strategy of continuing to grow our dividend over time but also looking at buybacks to shareholders as well. Operator : The next question is from Judah Frommer with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Judah Frommer : One, a little bit more long term. You guys probably have some of the best data analytics on your customer base in the industry. So when Rodney mentioned kind of the habits of newer customers and specifically new e-com customers, right, how could you see the opportunity to further monetize or kind of gain further loyalty from new and existing customers kind of beyond the pandemic, right? If you assume that people are going to eat a little bit more at home and that you have the ability to kind of incentivize your customers to do a little bit more than that, how does maybe next year look for you relative to where you may have thought it would be before the pandemic? W. McMullen: Yes. We love the question, and it's something that we're spending a ton of resources. We had as many new customers come to us in a couple of weeks as what we did all of last year, and we continue to have a lot of new customers. So we're using all the things that we would normally do on welcoming new customers in but doing it in a much more aggressive way. Obviously, one of the things that we want to make sure is they have a great experience. So if you look at our supply chain team working with our merchants, we're getting the stores inventories back up to pre-COVID levels. So the in-stock position improves. The continued focus on fresh and continuing to even -- fresh was a priority already, but making sure that the products that customers get stays fresh and then with a friendly smile or an incredibly easy digital experience. So your question, we love, it's the opportunity that we have in front of us. So far, we've been able to gain good market share during the pandemic. And obviously, we're going to continue to focus on making sure we take care of those customers and keep them and continue to build their basket in terms of what they spend with us versus other places. Gary Millerchip : Judah, the only thing I would add is that, to your point around data, we spent a lot of time looking at the data that we have and also the data that's available in the marketplace over the last 20 years from whether it's government data, more broad market data, along with our own shopping information, and really looking at what are the scenarios around where we see the customer going over, to your point, not really the next sort of month or 2 but the rest of the year and into next year and maybe even further out. We do feel from everything that we see that we're putting ourselves in a strong position based on the investments that we're making as part of Restock Kroger to come out the other side of this in a stronger place. And everything that we see, while this obviously no one knows and it's hard to predict, would say that based on the -- less around maybe the pandemic but just on generally when customers are in more of an economically challenged situation and combining that with these restrictions, we do think there'll be some level of a -- I won't call it a permanent shift but a multiple-year shift to food eaten at home versus food away from home, and that's been very much the case in our data and the external data when you look at the last couple of recessions. So our focus is very much on how do we make sure we're using personalization and tools and our strategy around creating value to really make sure that as we look out 12, 18 months, we come out of this in a stronger position, both in customers consuming more food at home but also Kroger's market share, so that it allows us to accelerate our overall long-term model around Restock Kroger but also delivering shareholder value. And we feel very positive about the way in which we believe we can deliver that over longer term. I think it's easier to look at the longer term in some ways than it is probably for the next 6 months and how exactly the trends will play out. Judah Frommer : Okay. That's helpful. And if I could just follow up on kind of 2 items that maybe we could clean up a little bit. Just first on the pension. In terms of go-forward expense that's hitting the income statement, that hasn't changed at all. Just what's running through the income statement is what you're required to contribute to those external net plans? Is that right? And then second, for the gross margin in Q2, is there still a headwind from alternative profits being a little bit slower than they would be? And is there also some benefit from promotions not being fully back to where you'd expect them to be? Gary Millerchip : Sure. On the pension side, yes, so the payment that we're making in Q2 is a discrete payment that we -- sorry, in Q1, I'm sorry, that we deliberately took the decision as we were in a strong position from a performance perspective and a cash flow perspective. We have no obligation to make that payment. It doesn't cause us to have to make payments later in the year or that we are obligated to some additional commitments later in the year. It was very much a decision that we made to take advantage of the strong performance and essentially protect that future risk and make sure that our associates' pension plans are in a strong position. So it's very much more of a forward-looking view of saying let's make sure we're putting ourselves and putting our associates in a position where we're protecting the future when we have the opportunity to do so. From a gross margin perspective, yes, certainly, I think on the alternative profit side, I mentioned it earlier. On the Media business, we're seeing a tremendous pickup in growth. So I wouldn't believe that we would see any headwinds from media. That's continuing to bounce back very strongly from a very temporary delay that we experienced in the first quarter, really during the lockdown period and as things were reset. Kroger Personal Finance is the biggest element of alternative profit from a profit contribution perspective, and that is sort of more, I guess, dependent on some of the broader recovery in the market when you think about gift card sales, restaurants are an important part of that category. And when you think about credit card spend, those elements are all tied to continued improvement in the economic situation. So while we are still able to tap into opportunity in KPF because we have low penetration of our customer base, we would expect that to continue to be a headwind in terms of impacting gross margin and performance for the year. But media, certainly, we wouldn't have that same view there. W. McMullen: And we would expect to continue to do promotions. And one of the things when you look at the details behind first quarter, almost basically all the gross margin improvement was driven by leverages and marketing expense from the higher sales, warehouse and transportation and shrink, and our team had incredible strong quarter on shrink. So it's really those leverage, and we would expect continue to have some of those leverage benefits at the higher sales that we're expecting. Operator : The next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : Recognizing that it takes several years for a digital customer to become as profitable as an in-store customer, what will be the margin impact over the next 3 years if your digital penetration remains where it is today? W. McMullen: It's a great question. And I can tell you before COVID-19, our digital business has become a tailwind in terms of the incremental improvement from where it was before. And as we look forward, we would expect as customers mature that, that would still be the case. And that's going to be a combination of customer spending -- and I'm talking about in total, not just the new customers by themselves. In total, as that customer continues to give us more of their total share of spend for a household and as our teams continue to take costs out in terms of serving that customer and as our Ocado sheds begin to take -- come online and some of the other facilities to supply our customers, we would expect that digital will be a tailwind for us as we move forward, and it's really just the fact that the business basically doubled overnight. Michael Lasser : And you mentioned that you're building all different types of Ocado shed. The first one are large ones in different parts of the country. What has the learnings from this experience influence -- how it influenced the sheds that you're going to create moving forward? W. McMullen: It's really if you look -- as we've been working on it in total, and Ocado has done a lot of work to be able to get the economics viable for a smaller shed, over time, that will allow us to go into smaller markets with those -- with sheds as well. So it's part of the overall supply chain design, and it's playing out as we expected. And Ocado is continuing to up their game as well. So it's really the experience. We're looking forward to Ocado's sheds opening up in Canada and France, and that will provide an additional set of learnings as well. Michael Lasser : And if I could add one last one. I know this is hard to tease out from the data, but you have a lot of really good information. What have you been able to discern about different meal occasions that are now being eaten at home? So as consumers return to work and eat more of their meals at restaurants around where they work, to what degree is that going to result in the slowdown in the IDs that you're experiencing? Similarly, maybe you can tease out how soups and salads are doing versus something you might eat at dinner, where dinner could also slow as we go to those families more. W. McMullen: Yes. The -- overall, we're still seeing people shop at fewer stores and, as Gary mentioned, a large spend per basket. If you look at the department, that's probably the easiest directly to talk about is our deli department. And our deli department, the trends over the last 4 or 5 weeks have been significantly improved from where it was in the height of the lockdowns. We would expect a lot of those meals are things where people are preparing at home and taking to work. Our customers tell us they're still minimizing the different places they go and minimizing their exposure. So that's something that we want to make sure that we're there for the customer. Operator : The next question is from Greg Badishkanian with Wolfe Research. Spencer Hanus : This is Spencer on for Greg. I understand that the situation still remains pretty fluid. But can you just provide some additional color on what you think the new normal looks like for food retail? And do you think COVID has accelerated a structural shift towards sort of eating at home channel? W. McMullen: Yes. The -- first of all, if you look at things that we think, for sure, is the digital channel and people eating via that accelerated the trends that we're already on. If you look at like our Home Chef business, they had an incredible quarter with picking up new customers as well. The thing that I get most hopeful about is when we talk to customers, customers tell us they like eating at home as a family and eating together and having meals together at home. And one of our responsibilities is to help them keep it fresh and innovative and new ideas, and we continue to work on that. But everything that we can see, the customer likes that, and they like learning how to cook and cook as a family. So that trend is something that we focus on a lot and try to make sure we're supportive of it. Spencer Hanus : That's helpful. And then we've seen promotions tick down across the industry throughout this crisis. Has COVID changed your philosophy on price investments at all? And then would you expect an acceleration in promotions in the back half of the year? W. McMullen: Yes. One of the things that I'm super proud of our teams is we've had an ad and promoted every week during the pandemic to try to help our customers' budget go as far as possible. The only change that we made was we stopped doing the buy 10 for 10s and things like that, that incentivized multiple purchases on items that we're in short supply because we wanted to support as many customers as possible, getting those. We would continue to use our data to understand what's important to the customer and some customers are in different financial situations, whether they lost their jobs or they were able to work from home. And we're supporting both of those customer segments with promotions, loyalty mailings and other offers that are 1 :1, in addition to what you can see in an ad, and we think that's an important component to continue to support. Gary Millerchip : I think the other thing I would add, Rodney, is that we mentioned earlier around the pickup fee being an investment in price with the promotion there. But also, we did adapt our plan around making sure we're giving value to customers where product was more available. And so the team did a really nice job in promoting on HBC and general merchandise products. And while it's very true to say that grocery and fresh led the way, we saw significant double-digit growth in both of those categories and would have seen some lower gross margin in those 2 categories because we were more promotional in making sure that as being a business that was opened through the pandemic that we were delivering value for customers. I think that's been -- the team did a really nice job of making sure we were creating value there and delivering value there. Operator : The next question is from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Kenneth Goldman : I'll just ask 1 because I know we're late. You talked about some of the trends in states that reopened first. Maybe too early, but what are you seeing in states where there are headlines about a second wave or cases increasing? Have you seen any upticks there? Or again, is it just too early to say for sure? W. McMullen: I think it's too early to tell for sure, and those were states where people were more comfortable going out, anyway, even during lockdowns. So it's really early to -- but we're really not seeing massive shift changes. One last question. Operator : And that question comes from Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Michael Montani : Just want to see if -- can you hear me? W. McMullen: Yes. Michael Montani : Okay. Great. Sorry about that. So the question I have was 2 parts. The first was on traffic and ticket. I know you don't typically disclose that, but if you could give some incremental color around the 19% ID sales on that line? And then secondly, related to that was just if there's a sense of what percentage of that comp is being generated by existing loyal households versus the new households. Obviously, you had mentioned, Rodney, there was some strong growth in new customer acquisition. W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at -- on the ticket growth, we had significant double-digit increases in the average basket size. And we're finding that customers are going into the store less frequently, and so well over 100% of the growth is driven by basket size. If you look at new customers and existing customers, it's a meaningful number, but it's maybe 1/4 or 1/3 of the total when you look at all the pieces because we also have a lot of new customers to pick up and where we've launched where customers can pay a SNAP at pickup and things like that, new customers there as well. Michael Montani : Okay. And then I guess the other one I had was a lot of the questions I've been getting relate to how you all would be positioned to cycle this kind of comp in a year from now. And so I was just wondering if you could provide some incremental color around the Ocado partnership and I guess, in particular, as it relates to some of the c-store fulfillments and also like center store potential efficiencies that you could gain and reinvest back into competitive positioning. W. McMullen: Yes. The -- that's a question, obviously, we're spending a lot of time internally talking through and trying to understand as well. The thing that, Gary talked about it a little bit, but if you look at -- we would expect '21 to be better than what the trend would have been for '21 before COVID, and Gary mentioned that briefly in answering one of the other questions. So everything that we can see, we believe there are certainly meaningful shifts in the way people eat. I won't say permanent but certainly multiyear and that we would expect '21 to be better than what '21 would have been before COVID. To give more specifics than that, I think it's hard to say. As we get to next year, one of the things that we would expect is, certainly, in-stock positions will be better, which will be helpful, but people will be going back to a normal life more so as well. So we're going to do everything we can to make sure we're taking care of the customers we have and getting more of their share in the new customers. And the easiest point of context is just we would expect '21 to be better than what '21 would have been pre-COVID. Thanks, Michael. Appreciate it. I think the last question was a great question to end on. If you look at Restock Kroger and the work from Restock Kroger certainly position the Kroger well to deal, and we had good growth before COVID, and COVID certainly accelerated the infrastructure and foundations we had in place. And as we look to 2021, we would expect that to be better than what it was before COVID. The other comment that I want to make is, as you know, we always like to share a few final comments directed toward our associates and how we live our purpose every day. The senseless killings of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and so many more, too many more across our country have shaken me to the core. We share in everyone's feelings of sadness and outrage for the victims and their families. I am compelled to use Kroger's voice to express that we're against racism and the injustice toward the Black community. To become a greater part of the solution, we believe the most important next step is to listen. Recently, I was proud to be invited by Dr. Bernice King of The King Center to listen, learn and participate in open dialogue about how companies like ours can drive real tangible change. We also held the first of several listening sessions to hear directly from our associates about how we can better support them. Informed by deliberate listening, we intend to take more action. As the first step, our company is establishing a $5 million fund to support the advancement of racial equality and justice. This new investment will be earmarked within The Kroger Foundation for improving diversity, equity and inclusion. We know there's more work to be done, and we will continue to share our progress. Thank you for all you have done and will do for each other and our customers and communities. And to all on the call, thank you for joining our call today. Thank you very much. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Rebekah Manis, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Rebekah Manis : Thank you, Gary. Good morning and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information.  Our second quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. This is obviously an unprecedented time, and we are taking the additional step of providing more details on current business trends this quarter, so our prepared remarks may run a little longer than normal. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] Please mark October 27 on your calendar for a brief business update from Rodney McMullen and Gary Millerchip on our performance against Restock Kroger goals and how the pandemic is shaping our business model. Given the travel restrictions that are still in place, this meeting will be conducted virtually, and we plan to host a full Investor Day in spring 2021, hopefully in person, to share more on the business outlook and key drivers of our long-term growth model. Further details will be shared soon, and we hope you will join us. I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. W. McMullen: Thank you, Rebekah. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me today to review Kroger's second quarter 2020 results is Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip. Each day, I'm inspired by the work our incredible associates do to bring to life our purpose, to feed the human spirit. I am proud of our dedicated associates who are serving our customers when they need us most. Our top priority is to provide a safe environment for associates and customers, and as the pandemic continues, we know that Kroger will continue to rise to meet the challenge. Six months into the pandemic, while there is still much we cannot predict, we still -- we have a greater clarity in many areas across the business. Since March, we have invested more than $1 billion to both reward our associates and to safeguard them and our customers through implementation of dozens of safety measures. The company's total COVID-19 incident rate continues to track meaningfully below the rate in surrounding communities where we operate. We have learned and continue to learn a lot while keeping our stores and supply chain open and serving America during the pandemic.  We continue to play a key role in addressing the critical need to expand COVID-19 testing. The Kroger Health team facilitated more than 150,000 COVID-19 tests at walk-up and drive-thru locations across the country. Recently, Kroger Health announced the expansion of COVID-19 testing offerings at more than [ 220 clinic ] locations.  As the nation prepares to enter the flu season, testing will become even more critical to help diagnose COVID-19 amidst potential similar symptoms. We announced earlier this week a comprehensive flu shot program designed to help Americans get their recommended vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Despite the pandemic-related challenges, we delivered extremely strong results in the second quarter. Customers are at the center of everything we do, and as a result, we are growing market share. Kroger's strong digital business is a key contributor to this growth as the investments made to expand our digital ecosystem are resonating with customers.  Our results continue to show that Kroger is a trusted brand, and our customers choose to shop with us because they value the product quality and freshness, convenience and digital offerings that we provide. While we delayed certain cost-saving initiatives in the first quarter, as of the close of the second quarter, we are back on pace to achieve them.  I continue to be proud of the way our associates have adapted and adopted to the new ways of working during the pandemic to continue to achieve strong results. We are more certain than ever that the strategic choices and investments made through Restock Kroger to execute against our competitive moats, fresh, our brand, personalization and seamless, have positioned us to meet the moment. We are also positioned to deliver 2020 and beyond for our customers, associates and shareholders as we believe a number of impacts of COVID will be structural and lasting.  Our data insights show customers are rediscovering their passion for cooking at home and have an aspiration to eat more healthy foods as a result of COVID. When we talk to our customers, they tell us they plan to continue to prepare and eat more meals at home. As children return to school, many families are telling us they plan to make breakfast in the morning and prepare lunch for their children to take school. As we talk to other companies across America, we believe return to work will look very different with many employees working part of the week from home. And finally, while the full economic impact of COVID-19 is yet understood, our data shows that during the periods of lower economic activity, we see a structural shift from food consumed away from home to food consumed at home. All of these factors combined lead us to believe there will be more meals eaten at home or prepared at home for the foreseeable future.  Now I'd like to walk you through some examples of how our competitive moats have positioned us for growth in the short and long term. Even before the pandemic, our digital business had become a tailwind. The pandemic certainly has accelerated customer preference for seamless offerings. Our customers are increasingly turning to our e-commerce solutions for their grocery and household essential needs. Many of our customers are ordering groceries online for the first time as a result of COVID-19, and the majority of them tell us they plan to continue to do so in the future.  Kroger began investing in digital several years ago to build a seamless ecosystem that would deliver anything, anytime, anywhere. As a result, we have over 2,100 pickup locations and 2,400 delivery locations, reaching 98% of our customers with a seamless customer experience that combines the best of our physical stores with digital. Kroger was the first to integrate pickup and delivery into one seamless experience. These investments were especially timely as customer adoption of pickup and delivery has grown significantly during the pandemic.  Kroger's digital ecosystem continues to expand and customers are increasingly engaging with us. For example, Home Chef is growing incredibly fast, no doubt accelerated by the food at home trend that we believe is a structural change. We also announced that Kroger Ship will expand to offer an extended ship-to-home assortment through a marketplace offering of third-party sellers. We will continue to expand our ecosystem over time.  The Kroger technology and digital team continues to create innovative experiences that are changing the way we serve customers across America and was recognized for the third consecutive year as the best place to work in IT by Computerworld. This recognition is awarded to companies that have innovative industry-leading workspaces offering a great customer associate experience.  As a result of the pandemic, we continue to see a slow return to normal from the shutdown period, resulting in fewer customer visits but increased basket size. Customers across the country are still staying home and cooking at home that is now part of their new routine. This makes our leadership position in fresh an even more important sales driver for Kroger. Customers rank our fresh departments higher than all of our big box competitors, and our fresh departments generated strong identical sales in the second quarter and gained market share.  Our brands is also a key competitive moat for Kroger. We continue to meet the diverse needs of our customers with significant growth across the 3 largest brands. Our customers are eating more at home and we are seeing some customer segments trade up to the larger pack sizes as well as more premium quality foods and natural and organic foods. Our larger-sized big pack platform is up well over 50%. Private Selection is up over 17% and Simple Truth is up over 20% in the second quarter. Our brands continues to tap into emerging trends and evolving customer needs, delivering new flavors and innovative new items like the new plant-based Emerge grinds and patties, which launched in late 2019.  A recent third-party industry study reconfirmed that Simple Truth is the most-loved natural and organic brand in the U.S. Simple Truth significantly outperformed competitors on strength of brand, which is a combination of awareness, willingness to recommend and strength as the driver of store selection. In continuing to exceed our customers' expectations of value and quality while also consistently delivering innovative new items our customers love, our brands remain one of our most powerful competitive advantages.  Finally, personalization and data remains one of Kroger's key and core competitive moats. We use our data to understand what is most important to our customers and continued to offer promotions throughout the quarter. And we think it is an important component to continue to support as the pandemic continues and government stimulus benefits have expired.  Many of our customers are experiencing some form of financial hardship that we expect to impact discretionary purchases and eating out. This is one of the unique capabilities of the Kroger ecosystem we can deliver for both customers on a budget and customers who are trading up to premium products and/or larger sizes.  Turning now to partnerships. While COVID-19 has not necessarily changed how we think about our approach to e-commerce, it has accelerated our thinking about how our full evolution of seamless strategy, inclusive of Ocado. Ocado is a strategic partner of choice, delivering innovation and best-in-class experience and economic advantage through efficient fulfillment. We are confident the future of our ecosystem will incorporate a mix of capabilities and facilities ranging in sizes, and our network will flex as demand matures and the optionality will allow us to fulfill same-day or next-day delivery or pickup and customers or store replenishment. Ocado's model incorporates state-of-the-art automation and AI to expand Kroger's products to a larger footprint. And our model to deliver to customers is significantly less costly than our existing model. We are on track to open the first 2 sites in the spring of 2021.  Developed talent is a driver of Restock Kroger, and we work extremely hard to ensure that we have the right talent, teams and structure and the right focus areas in our core supermarket business and our alternative profit businesses. We are focused on both developing, training and promoting internal talent and hiring external executives, both food industry and technology, which together drives our retail supermarket business and all of our businesses. Kroger has been investing to raise wages of our frontline associates for the last several years. As part of Restock Kroger announced in 2017, over the period of 2018 to 2020, Kroger will have invested an incremental $800 million in associate wage increases, and that is $300 million more than the original plan. As a result of this continuing investment, Kroger has increased its average hourly rate to over $15 per hour. And with our comprehensive and best-in-class benefits, including health care, paid time-off and retirement plans, our average hourly rate is over $20.  As the largest traditional grocery retailer in America, Kroger is committed to being a force of good in the communities we serve. Our purpose to feed the human spirit continues to guide how we operate our business, care for our communities and deliver value to all of our stakeholders. Last month, we released our 2020 ESG report, highlighting progress toward our sustainability goals. We are committed to continuing to integrate ESG metrics into our business strategy, driving shared value for our associates, customers, communities and company.  We recently made the decision to contribute an additional $20 million split evenly between The Kroger Co. Foundation and the Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Foundation. We also added $5 million to a fund created to support the advancement of racial equity and justice. We believe that it is vitally important to get resources to our communities as they continue to face hardships related to the pandemic, the economic downturn and racial injustice.  Under Restock Kroger, we have made significant investments to establish a seamless digital ecosystem, strengthen our brands and our personalization capabilities and to enhance product freshness and quality. These investments, combined with how our associates have responded to the pandemic and customers eating more meals at home, give us confidence that Kroger's performance in both 2020 and 2021 will be even stronger than previously anticipated.  I will now turn it over to Gary for more details into the quarter financials. Gary? Gary Millerchip : Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Before getting into our business results, I wanted to echo Rodney's comments from earlier and say how extremely proud I am of our associates for continuing to serve our customers and communities throughout the pandemic. We remain committed to investing to ensure a safe environment for our associates and customers, and we will also continue to use our customer insights to invest in delivering greater value for customers in ways that are most relevant today and that build future loyalty.  Results for the second quarter were strong and reinforce the strategic investments we have made over the last several years as part of Restock Kroger. The quarter turned out much better than we previously expected. This was due to several factors, including stronger sales results and disciplined balance between cost savings and investments while also managing cost inflation volatility in key fresh categories. Additionally, fuel performed better than predicted, and we were very pleased with our alternative profit results, which rebounded from COVID-19 impacts more quickly than anticipated.  Now I'd like to provide further detail on second quarter performance. We delivered an adjusted EPS of $0.73 per diluted share, up 66% compared to the same quarter last year. Kroger reported identical sales without fuel of 14.6% during the second quarter. Sales momentum continued from the first quarter with identical sales without fuel in June and July trending in the mid-teens. During our final period of the quarter, which runs from mid-July to mid-August, identical sales without fuel were 12.5% as we saw reduced government stimulus and SNAP funding and lower back-to-school activity.  Digital sales grew 127% and contributing 4.4% to identical sales without fuel. New customer engagement and with our pickup and delivery services continued to grow and we continue to invest in the customer experience. This included offering fee-free pickup to provide more value for our customers in ways that are most relevant at this time. Our digital sales growth was profitable on an incremental basis, and we were pleased with the progress we made to improve profitability by reducing the cost to fulfill a pickup order during the quarter. We see a clear path to further improve digital profitability by leveraging our personalization tools to improve sales mix, continuing to reduce cost to fulfill an order via process improvements and automation and accelerating growth in media revenue generated from digital sales.  Adjusted FIFO operating profit for the second quarter was $894 million, up 43% compared to the second quarter of 2019. We were pleased with the overall pass-through rate achieved from the elevated sales in the quarter, which, including the impact of digital growth and incremental costs associated with COVID-19, was approximately 10%. COVID-related cost investments in associate depreciation, cleaning, safety and supply chain totaled approximately $250 million in the quarter. Gross margin was 22.8% of sales for the second quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased 5 basis points, primarily driven by sourcing efficiencies, sales leverage related to shrink, transportation and advertising costs plus growth in alternative profit streams. This was partially offset by price investments as we continued to invest in delivering greater value for customers and mix changes from lower relative sales in higher gross margin categories such as deli bakery.  The OG&A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items, decreased 61 basis points due to sales leverage and execution of Restock Kroger initiatives, partially offset by ongoing COVID-19 related costs mentioned earlier to protect the health and safety of our customers and associates. Rent and depreciation, excluding fuel, decreased 27 basis points due to sales leverage. We were very pleased with the progress on our Restock Kroger savings initiatives in the quarter and now expect to achieve the targeted $1 billion of savings in 2020.  Fuel remains an important part of our strategy to drive customer loyalty. Compared to the first quarter and consistent with market trends, the decline in gallons slowed to around 15% in the second quarter. We remain well positioned with our markets due to our fuel procurement practices and market-leading reward program.  The average retail price of fuel was $2.14 this quarter versus $2.71 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin in the second quarter was $0.37 compared to $0.35 in the same quarter last year. While fuel operating profit was $30 million lower than the same quarter last year, this was better than expected. For the remainder of 2020, we expect fuel profitability will continue to be a headwind compared to prior year as we cycle margins from 2019 and gallons continue to be impacted by COVID.  Kroger's alternative profit model is built on a platform of leveraging supermarket traffic and data, with media and Kroger Personal Finance representing the largest contributors to growth in 2020. Thanks to our team's responsiveness to the challenges COVID has presented to our alternative profits portfolio, these businesses rebounded strongly in the second quarter, and we now expect growth approaching $100 million for the fiscal year 2020. We continue to believe alternative profit will be a major accelerator of our model in the future, and COVID-19 has not changed the long-term profit expectations previously shared as part of Restock Kroger.  Kroger precision marketing drove tremendous acceleration in our media business in the second quarter. On the strength of growth in digital sales, digital customer engagement and new inventory, revenue growth doubled compared to the first quarter. In-store media also bounced back as stay-at-home orders were lifted in many of the communities we serve.  Kroger Personal Finance experienced higher transactions in the second quarter compared to the first quarter as customer activity improved in gift cards, lottery and money services. While trends at KPF are improving, we continue to expect KPF profit will be lower than our original expectations for 2020 due to COVID-19.  We continue to invest in our associates as a key part of Restock Kroger in a variety of ways, including investments in wages, training and development. As you know, for the last decade or more, Kroger has sought opportunities to address the funding challenges facing the pension plans in which our associates participate. We believe challenges related to pension funding can be mitigated if plans are reviewed and addressed over time.  Consistent with this effort, last month, we announced a tentative agreement to improve security of future retirement benefits of over 33,000 Kroger family of company associates across 20 local UFCW unions with an investment of nearly $1 billion. Ratification of this agreement is still expected to occur in the third quarter of 2020.  We ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW covering associates in [ Roadie ] during the second quarter. We are currently negotiating with the UFCW for contracts covering store associates in Las Vegas, Little Rock, Houston, Dallas and Charleston, West Virginia. Looking ahead, towards the end of this year, we will be negotiating with the UFCW for Fry's stores associates in Arizona. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good-quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We strive to make our overall benefit package relevant to today's associates.  Our financial results continue to be pressured by health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions, which represent many of our associates on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us to create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates.  Turning now to financial strategy. Kroger's financial model has proven to be resilient throughout the economic cycle. We continue to generate strong free cash flow and maintain strong liquidity. We are committed to investing in the business to drive profitable growth, maintaining our investment-grade debt rating and returning excess free cash to investors via share repurchases and a growing dividend over time. We remain confident in our business model and our ability to achieve consistently attractive total shareholder returns. We will provide more color on our future approach to capital allocation and the use of excess cash during our March 2021 Investor Day.  In 2020, we are being disciplined in how we deploy capital, and all aspects of our capital plan are being evaluated to make sure that our investments will deliver strong returns and position Kroger for long-term success post COVID-19. We now expect total capital expenditure to range between $3 billion and $3.4 billion in 2020. We have widened the range of our guidance due to the uncertainty on timing of when spend will occur because of COVID-19.  Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 1.7 compared to 2.46 a year ago. This is below our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Kroger held temporary cash investments of approximately $2.4 billion as of the end of the quarter, reflecting improvements in operating performance, significant improvements in working capital and delayed tax payments as a result of the CARES Act. We expect working capital to improve for the year although not to the level experienced year-to-date, which is inflated by sales growth due to COVID-19.  During the quarter, Kroger repurchased $211 million of shares under its $1 billion Board authorization announced on November 5, 2019. On September 11, 2020, the Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program, replacing the prior authorization. In June, Kroger increased the dividend by 13%, marking the 14th consecutive year of dividend increases.  Turning now to guidance for the remainder of 2020. As we shared last quarter, the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the outlook for food retail, and we continued to monitor, evaluate and adjust our plans to address the impact to our business. While there are clearly still many unknowns, as Rodney shared in his opening comments, we now have greater clarity in many areas of our business and the drivers of food at home consumption.  As a result of our strong performance in the first half of the year, the expectation of sustained trends in food-at-home consumption and confidence in our ability to execute against the Restock Kroger strategy, we are updating our full year 2020 guidance. For the full year 2020, we expect total identical sales without fuel to exceed 13%, and we expect to achieve adjusted EPS growth of approximately 45% to 50%. We are providing a wider range on guidance than we would normally provide at this point in the year to account for the variety of outcomes that could materialize as a result of the pandemic. In the second half of 2020, we expect identical sales, excluding fuel, to continue at elevated levels, although tapering from the level we've experienced so far this year. Our guidance contemplates continued investments in the customer and ongoing COVID-19 related costs to protect the safety of our customers and associates, balanced with continued execution of cost-saving initiatives and growth in alternative profits. We expect fuel profitability will be a headwind for the remainder of 2020.  Finally, relative to delivering on our total shareholder return growth targets, as shared at our November 2019 Investor Day, these factors also lead us to believe that our 2021 business results will be higher than we would have expected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. As the operating environment continues to evolve, we will be transparent and communicate any important changes that could impact our outlook. I'll now turn it back to Rodney. W. McMullen: Thanks, Gary. We provided specific guidance to help you understand how we see the business today. While there are still a lot of uncertainties, we are confident in our team's ability to navigate through this. We are laser-focused on winning with the customer, and our true measure of success internally will be growing market share sustainably over time.  As Rebekah said earlier, we have scheduled a call on October 27. We will provide a business update relative to our November 2019 business commitments as well as our overall ESG commitments. We value the impact of an in-person meeting with you and have made the decision to reschedule the timing of our traditional Investor Day to spring of 2021.  We remain incredibly confident in both our business model and TSR model and believe that not only 2020 will be strong, but as Gary mentioned, 2021 will be even stronger than we previously anticipated. Now we look forward to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Greg Badishkanian with Wolfe Research. Spencer Hanus : This is actually Spencer Hanus on for Greg. My first question is just, can you talk about the comp trends that you guys are seeing quarter-to-date? And then we've seen ticket growth outpacing traffic growth as consumers combined trips. When do you think ticket and traffic trends get more normalized? W. McMullen: The -- in terms of where we are quarter-to-date, we would still be slightly ahead of double digits. And if you look at -- when traffic returns to normal, it's kind of fascinating. As you look at markets where COVID incident rates are lower or less severe, what we find are people start visiting the store more often but they don't spend as much. But if you look at overall, the trends are pretty similar.  That's probably really the only insight that we have at this point. We do find everything that we can tell, people are enjoying cooking at home, enjoying eating as a family. And those are things that we believe will last past COVID. I don't know, Gary, anything you'd want to add to that? Gary Millerchip : No. I think you covered it well, Rodney. I think we are seeing some gradual sort of, I guess, this return to patterns that customers get comfortable with in a COVID environment as -- continue to see large basket sizes and fewer trips, but we've been encouraged certainly in the second quarter by, well, categories like deli, bakery would be significantly lower than the heightened levels of sales we'd have seen in the last quarter or so from categories like grocery and meat and produce. Deli, bakery is positive again, which I think shows that customers are starting to at least return to some of those behaviors and certainly in areas like specialty cheese and floral. It's really encouraging to see those categories turning to sort of low to mid-single-digit ID sales as well. Spencer Hanus : That's really helpful. And then in your prepared remarks, I think you mentioned that digital sales were profitable on an incremental basis. Can you provide some more color on that comment? And then how do you expect the launch of a marketplace with Kroger Ship to impact the profitability of the online business? Gary Millerchip : Yes. Thanks for the question. So the way we think about digital profitability is -- I know we've shared some of this color before, but essentially, we track very closely how a power customer behaves and when they engage digitally, and we see a significant level of incremental sales overall in the customer relationship. Obviously, you have to offset that against the incremental costs that we incur in filling the order for the customer.  And in addition to that, then, of course, we're now seeing tremendous growth in digital media revenue that's generated off of a customer spending dollars with us digitally because we can then truly personalize the communication to the customer, and we can close the loop for a CPG partner in understanding whether that advertising led to a sale with the customer themselves.  So when we look at the overall impact of the incremental sales, the cost to fill the order and the media revenue, we see a profitability pass-through, if you like, in terms of the transaction from a digital perspective. It's obviously at a much lower level than you would see in the store channel, but we are seeing that profitability flow through on an incremental basis.  We believe that there's significant opportunities, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, to continue to improve that profitability. The first would be improving sales mix, and we believe there's a lot of opportunity using our personalization tools to do that. Marketplace would be a good example that -- well, also opportunity to do that as well. So that would be a part of that component where we think continuing to improve the basket size and the type of products the customer has in the basket is definitely going to be a driver of bridging any gap between store and digital profitability. Beyond that, we also believe there's significant opportunity to improve profitability by continuing to reduce the cost to fill an order through automation and process improvement and continuing to grow those digital media dollars. In the short term, we have plans on those areas today. And then, of course, as Rodney shared on the call earlier, Ocado would also be a significant accelerator of those drivers by further improving the customer experience to improve mix and continuing to take more cost out of the model through automation and AI. W. McMullen: Just to add a little bit, and everybody's heard me say this before, but when you look at digital overall, we've always viewed our first job is to make sure we don't lose the customer. And obviously, with our teams, they've done a fantastic job of supporting amazing growth, and that's our technology team, our digital team, our store teams and warehouse.  We can now see a clear path to profitability of that. And one of the insights that Gary just shared in terms of the incremental is one piece of that path to profitability. Obviously, all the things that we're working on together, what we're expecting of ourselves is we will get to the point where we're indifferent if a customer connects with us digitally or a physical store. And everything that we can see, the customer actually will do both. And we made great progress on reducing cost to serve on a per customer basis. And then if you look at some of the other pieces of our digital offering like Home Chef, Home Chef had an incredible quarter, both sales growth and profitability as well. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : So Rodney, you mentioned you took share in fresh. How do you think your share in other categories trended? And can you give us more detail behind your decision to reengage in price investments during the period? I think that was something that -- or at least promotions were put on hold in the prior period. It sounds like the overall environment has gotten a bit more competitive in the most recent period. Is that fair? W. McMullen: No. I would say a little differently. We've promoted throughout the pandemic. Now we did change what we promoted because obviously, you want to promote what you have, so we would have not promoted paper towels and toilet paper and certain meat items and things like that because just the availability of supply. But we've had promotions throughout the pandemic and it's really on the things that matter.  We continue to invest in price, and we think it's really important that we think customers will look at it reflectively that we've been there to support them throughout to help them stretch their budgets. So the -- as Gary mentioned, waiving the pickup fee, continuing to invest in promotions, continuing to invest in price, all of those are things that we believe will pay off. Our customers will reward us for what we're doing over time. On market share, I specifically talked about fresh, but we continue to gain share in the center store, fresh and all areas of the store, and our own brands continue to gain share as well. Michael Lasser : Okay. And so you mentioned the final period of the quarter was -- IDs were up about 12%. It sounds like it slowed a little bit in the most recent period. Would you attribute that to some of the change in unemployment benefits in staff and continued pressure from back to school? And how does that back-to-school pressure manifest? W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at the back to school, there's a lot of moving parts and we think that's part of it. We also think if you look at the holidays, people celebrate holidays differently. If you look at some of the sporting events, people are celebrating those differently. So there's a lot of moving parts, so I think it's hard to say the specifics. I don't know, Gary, anything you'd want to add to that? Gary Millerchip : Yes. I think it's an interesting time right now, to Rodney's point, because we look at the trend in markets where we try and correlate results to higher levels of COVID cases, and it's become a lot more difficult to really track those trends. There's certainly a small level of correlation, it seems like, between the higher markets with COVID cases and the differentiation where you've got states and markets that have smaller levels of cases. But that being said, it seems like, to Rodney's point, I think more of the trends are being as customers are now adapting to some level of a new normal. And so as you mentioned, Michael, things like back to school certainly impacts for a period of time. I think the government's [ now followed ] in the market. We would say we saw a change there in the final period of the prior quarter and a little bit in this quarter.  But then it's like what's the next trigger. So as now we're coming through the back-to-school campaign, what will happen in the final part of the year as maybe customers are less willing to eat out at restaurants in the cold and if capacity is still constrained in restaurants. I share that just because I think there's going to be almost different triggers that it's less, in some ways, what we're seeing in the trends around what's happening with COVID cases, but more about how our customers are adapting to what's the new theme and the new event that causes them to change shopping behavior. I think there's multiple different factors that are going on with the customer. And I think that the combination of all those of what led to, I think, the slightly different trajectory compared to the first 2 parts of quarter 2. Operator : The next question is from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Kenneth Goldman : Two for me. First, I wanted to see if you've seen any notable changes in your product sales mix since the stimulus checks have run out. At least in the scanner data that we can see, store brands are still losing a lot of share within the measured grocery channel. But I'm not sure if that sort of corresponds with exactly what you're seeing. I might have expected store brands to do a little bit better right now overall. But I'm just curious if maybe you're seeing anything that's changing in there more recently. W. McMullen: Ken, I wouldn't say that we're seeing anything that's massive type trends. If you look at during the quarter, we would have seen better sales growth in CPG brands than own brands. But if you look at own brands overall, they continue to gain share relative to the market. The -- you continue to see behavior changes based on what's going on in people's lives, but you still see people aggressively -- alcohol sales are very strong, beer and wine is very strong. If you look at big pack, sales are strong. If you look at premium products, sales are strong. So you continue to see people trading up in places where they want to. If you look at, as Gary mentioned, deli, bakery, continue to make progress. So it's -- I love the question, but I think it's still hard to give a specific answer. Kenneth Goldman : No, I understand. And then my follow-up, your FIFO gross margin ex fuel in the first quarter was up, I think, 46 basis points year-on-year. It was up still this quarter, but to your point, it was up less, I think, 5 was the number. Gary, I think you were very clear highlighting price investments as one of the reasons for that deceleration.  I just would love to get a sense of what you're looking at for that number going ahead, whether we should be sort of thinking about in our models something closer to the first quarter or something closer to the second in terms of year-on-year. And I know there's all sorts of puts and takes and that's a very difficult one to answer. I'm just trying to sort of poke around a bit and see what you might think about that. Gary Millerchip : Yes. I think -- thanks for the question, Ken. I think as we've shared kind of consistently, our goal is really to be balanced in the business model and continue to balance the investments we'll be making in supporting the customer, which is certainly our continued intent with the savings that we achieved through sourcing benefits and then, of course, alternative profit being accelerator of gross margin as well.  In the quarter itself, where a lot of the focus for us was, as Rodney mentioned, the fee-free pickup is an important part of value for the customer. And we believe our digital sales relative to the more traditional grocery sector is pretty high. And so that's a bigger influence in our numbers, and we believe we gained market share in digital as well during the quarter. So that, I think, influences the level of investment, for one thing.  I think the second part is fresh department's inflation was pretty volatile during the quarter, and we saw certainly a [ mean time ] inflation and in meat, produce and deli, bakery, cost inflation would have been higher than retail as we were investing in supporting the customer through the volatility in price and making sure we were building long-term loyalty.  So I think we continue to be expecting to invest where it makes sense for the customer, but we feel very confident in our ability to balance those investments with cost savings through Restock Kroger, sourcing benefits and continuing to see leverage in things like shrink, warehouse and transportation and advertising. So I think the key message from us would be balanced and very consistent with the long-term growth model that we shared. Operator : The next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : So I want to start off, I guess, with just your capacity on click-and-collect. I was just curious where you guys are today from meeting all the demand out there for click-and-collect. And then related to that, I was also curious whether you think the removal of the pickup -- or the temporary removal of pickup for you is contributing to some of the share gains you're seeing? W. McMullen: Yes. In terms of capacity, we're constantly adjusting the capacity during the day because as people get used to the new normal, the times they want pickup slots constantly change. It's one area where I've been super proud of our teams, both stores and our data and technology and operations team in that constant adjusting and incrementally hiring people. There are stores now where we're aggressively investing a little bit of capital to be able to expand what's available within that store, and when we do that, that will allow us to add slots as well. So I would say the constraints on slots would be a slight opportunity, but I think the teams have done a great job of continuing to expand. The removal of the fee for a pickup, the temporary removal, is we look at it more in terms of trying to help a customer stretch their budget and try to be helpful in this environment. Customers still tell us the reason they like our pickup experience is really the freshness of our products and the quality of that and the assortment that we offer. So it probably helps, but I think it's more driven by the experience in the fresh side than waiving the fee. Rupesh Parikh : Great. And then I guess one quick follow-up for Gary. What's the right way to think about COVID expenses in the back half of the year? Gary Millerchip : Yes. I think we wouldn't get into specific numbers, but obviously, we did give you some color on the expense that we saw in Q2. Certainly, we would expect to be able to continue to optimize our operating plan, so we'd expect to provide continued efficiency in some of those plans that we execute on, and certainly, that was the case if you think about our investment in Q1 to Q2 as we're transitioning through the year and learning more and able to optimize our approach.  That being said, one of the reasons that cost would have been probably a little bit higher than we originally thought in Q2 was that during the quarter, if you recall, many states, if not all the states we now operate in, are mandating masks, and we decided to adopt that proactively before it happened in many states to really reinforce the importance of safety in our stores and providing the inventory for masks to make sure that during that transition, all of our customers were able to have access to a mask as a new cost, if you like, that we incurred.  So we're being very dynamic in the way we're managing those costs to make sure that we're, first and foremost, maintaining safety, and then secondly, obviously, being as efficient as we can be. But we feel very confident in our ability to manage and balance those costs with the incremental cost savings that we're achieving in our original model.  And as I shared in the prepared comments, we've been -- the team has done a phenomenal job in really adapting and adjusting our cost saving plans in light of COVID. And whereas in Q1, we announced that we may have some headwinds on the original $1 billion. We feel confident now we can achieve those. So overall, there'll certainly be those ongoing investments, but we feel confident in our ability to be able to manage them. Operator : The next question is from Karen Short with Barclays. Karen Short : Just actually on the gross margin, I had one quick follow-up and then I had a bigger question. Can you just give a little color on selling gross margins? I know that's not a topic that we've -- you've talked about on a consistent basis, but I think it would just help from the context of -- you said it drives customer loyalty to continue to promote during this time period and a lot of your competitors are not promoting. So I was wondering if you could give a little color on selling gross margins this quarter versus the first quarter. Gary Millerchip : Well, certainly, Karen, thanks for the question. It would have been an investment. As you are aware from what we shared in the first quarter, we saw significant benefit in expensing gross sales leverage across warehouse and transportation, across shrink and also across advertising. And while sales obviously tapered in Q2 versus Q1, we would continue to have seen selling -- expecting growth, I'm sorry, leverage on our overall sales results. So to be at 5 percent -- basis point improvement overall on gross margin, that would reflect the fact we invested in our selling growth rate during the quarter.  In the areas that I mentioned around continued acceleration of digital pickup, particularly in the fresh categories to make sure we're delivering value for our customers. And then there would also be, I think, an element that's important to mention, mix and the fact that with deli, bakery being a lower factor in the overall sales growth would also have brought down the selling growth rate somewhat as well. Karen Short : Okay. And then I wanted to just shift gears to digital for a second. So it looks -- I mean you can kind of back into e-com being around the 7%-ish of sales range now. So first, is that accurate? And then I was wondering if you could provide a little bit of a split or a split between what pickup is and versus delivery within that. And then I was wondering if you could give a little more color in terms of basket on each of the different like in-store versus pickup versus delivery. And then last portion of that is just any color on the new customers that you're gaining with respect to digital. W. McMullen: If you look at -- our percent of sales would be a little bit higher than your estimate. If you look at mix between pickup and delivery, it's still predominantly pickup. And we find customers find pickup incredibly flexible on their schedule, much more so than delivery, and that's the reason why they continue to like pickup in a good way. If you look at basket size, basket size would be significantly bigger on pickup versus in-store and pickup and delivery would be pretty similar.  On new customers, we're finding -- we're getting a lot of new customers, both in-store and digital both and probably the biggest change for both of those groups. We -- in the past, a new customer would have to earn their right to start getting loyal customer mailings and digital offers and things like that. During this, we've started treating customers as loyal shoppers immediately rather than waiting for them to engage with us for a period of time. And what we're finding is we're having success on retaining those customers and repeat purchases as well. Gary Millerchip : Maybe I can help you with that, Karen, on the comment about pickup and delivery. As Rodney mentioned, pickup is a significantly larger portion of the overall volume. I would say both of them are growing triple digits, so we are seeing very strong growth in both, but there isn't like a major change in the mix, if you like. Both have continued to grow significantly in the COVID period. Operator : Your next question is from Robby Ohmes with Bank of America Global Research. Robert Ohmes : Rodney, I was hoping, as a follow-up to Karen's question, can you give us more color kind of on what you're doing with Ocado versus the original plan? And maybe a little more color on kind of signposts we should be looking for in the back half and into next year on Ocado? And then just a separate question. Can you guys just give us color on what happened Labor Day weekend for you guys and how that was or was not similar to last year, et cetera? W. McMullen: Yes. I'll answer Ocado, and Gary, I'll let you talk about the Labor Day weekend. When we have our investor meeting in March, we'll get into a lot more details on Ocado. If you look at, obviously, the first initial part of the 2 first sheds that we'll open in Monroe, Ohio and in Florida, we'll be just scaling it and the assortment that customers have a desire for in that offering versus some other offerings. Those are 2 key parts.  We will get into specific signposts in terms of how to hold us accountable. We're using the learnings from Ocado in terms of what they have in the U.K., obviously in Canada and France. And it will be taking all of those learnings and then making sure we manage the cost of the start-up as well. So we're excited. We can't wait and we wish they would have opened a year ago. Gary Millerchip : And then Robby, on your second question, I would say, probably the broader comment I would make is Rodney shared, we're still trending in double-digit sales in the early part of the current quarter. It's a pretty difficult period to read, actually. It's probably the most important point, I would say, because the Labor Day weekend changed by a week, but we're also cycling weather from last year and then having some weather in this year. So it's been a really interesting, I would say, ride for the first 4 weeks of the new quarter and trying to interpret what's going on.  If we look at the cycling and adjusting for the weeks, I wouldn't say we really saw anything materially unusual out of Labor Day, except for some of the weather events in certain markets adding some complexity to the data. But overall, as we're coming out the other side of that, as Rodney mentioned, trending in the low double digit early part of the quarter. Robert Ohmes : That's helpful. And then one quick just follow-up on digital in those markets where people are coming back into stores. Is it -- do you see a significant falloff in digital? And would it be coming more from delivery or more from pickup? W. McMullen: The mix between pickup and delivery is more driven by available slots. We do not -- the growth, it's still triple-digit growth but it would be a little bit slower growth, but it's still meaningful growth. Operator : The next question is from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Edward Kelly : Good quarter, by the way. I feel for you guys on the gross margin, by the way, and I wanted to follow up on this because I think there's been some criticism in the market that your gross margin was not up as much as the sell side was modeling. But you're probably doing what you should with this windfall, right? You're investing in price, still delivered a large EPS beat. Others are not investing.  So I'm kind of curious, what are you seeing from a price gap standpoint in the marketplace currently, both versus like bigger discount players like Walmart but also your conventional players who maybe seem to be taking advantage of the current environment. Gary Millerchip : Yes. Thanks for the question, Ed. I think you summarized it well. From our perspective, we believe it's very important that we continue to deliver value for customers and we're staying very true to that plan. And when we look at prices, as we've shared a couple of examples on the call, for us, it's not just about everyday low price but it's about the promotional plan, it's about the investment in digital. And we feel like we're on a very clear path to deliver value for the customer that will drive long-term loyalty.  The way that our customers, when we talk to them and how we look at our data and measure value, we feel very good about the position that we're in, and our customers tell us we're delivering strong value to them. And we believe really kind of linked a little bit, I think to Rodney's comment, about how we think about setting up 2021 and making sure that we're winning long-term market share and growing our business so that the -- as things cycle through the pandemic, we end in a stronger position than we would have done prior to COVID-19 is really the journey that we believe we're on to make sure that we continue to connect more deeper with customers and drive value. We feel good about the journey and the results that we're achieving. We feel it's setting us up for the ability to be able to sustain that long-term growth in the future and as [ Rodney mentioned ]. Edward Kelly : Can I just follow up, Gary, by the way? When you look at the gross margin, we have heard from one of your peers that the end of May, June period was tougher because there was inflation in some of your categories, particularly protein. Was there anything about the cadence of the gross margin this quarter that was notable? Was it softer earlier on? Gary Millerchip : It certainly -- there's been a lot of dynamic changes in some of those fresh categories as I mentioned earlier ahead that we have to manage through. And I think the team did a phenomenal job in doing that and making sure that we help our customers navigate through that. So certainly, the -- we would just experience some of those same elements to manage during the early part of the quarter, which would have impacted at that point. But I think your initial question is the more important one of how we are thinking about balancing and investing in the business to make sure that we're delivering long-term growth. I wouldn't say that it affects how we think about how we're managing the business for the future. W. McMullen: To me, overall, Gary's last point is the critical one. We really are looking at everything in terms of what will connect us with the customer and position us best for sustainable growth over time and continue to gain market share. And we're -- and that's what we're doing. Obviously, we were able to continue to manage expenses very well as well, which gave us the capacity to invest as well. Rebekah Manis : And we have time for one last question. Operator : And that question will come from Kelly Bania with BMO Capital Markets. Kelly Bania : Was curious if we could talk a little bit about just price inflation mix and tonnage. I know there's been a lot of comments about traffic and basket. But I think the way that you guys tend to look at it is more tonnage. And so just curious if you can help us understand how that's played out in the quarter and what you're thinking about into the back half as you think about that kind of high single-digit ID outlook there between price inflation and tonnage. W. McMullen: We -- tonnage would continue to be strong. We have -- we're still continuing to -- if you look at our supply chain, our team has done a nice job of identifying other sources of capacity. And we are -- have access to warehouses both that we manage on a temporary basis and others that continue to support and manage the tonnage.  For me, the thing I find exciting about the tonnage is it's across the whole store. So tonnage growth is strong in center store, it's strong in produce, it's strong in meat, in all areas. So -- and obviously, in terms of the guidance that Gary gave for the rest of the year, we would expect that to continue.  We continue to expect cost inflation will be a little bit more than retail inflation. And those are categories where it's more driven by short-term things. If you look at meat, we would expect meat inflation to be more normalized, and as it more normalizes, then you would see our balance between the 2 very close. Gary Millerchip : Just maybe add to Rodney's comments on tonnage, it ties a little bit back to Rodney's comments on market share as well that we're certainly focused on, as Rodney mentioned, our most important measure of success on sales growth is obviously growing market share. And we look at that very closely through tonnage and units as much as we do through dollars because of the -- again, making sure that we're investing in the customer, and we're certainly pleased with our tonnage market share growth as well as the dollar market share growth during the quarter.  And then, as Rodney mentioned, Kelly, we've -- I think you've heard us say this before, but we generally build our model off of the 0.5% to 1% inflation. We'd certainly be running a bit ahead of that when you think about cost inflation, as Rodney mentioned earlier, with meat in particular being high but grocery would be probably a little bit north of 2% as well right now based on some of the trends that we're seeing. Kelly Bania : Okay, that's very helpful. And then if I can just ask 2 quick follow-up ones related to digital. I think I heard you mention regarding the pickup fee that, that was a temporary removal. And I guess I was just curious under what circumstances or time frame would you consider bringing that back? Or is that a market-by-market specific thought process? And also, maybe just thoughts on membership. Obviously, a lot of competitive developments with membership and in terms of digital, whether pickup or delivery. So just curious if you're in any way thinking of evolving into something like a membership program over time. W. McMullen: Yes. On the digital fee, it really -- at the moment, we put it in place just trying to help our customers and especially customers on a budget to help them stretch their weekly spending. And what we would do over time, we -- at this point, we really haven't decided, but it's part of the overall value equation that we're providing to customers.  On membership, as you know, we continually and have been, for a while, testing various types of membership programs. And when we find a membership program that really works, you'll see us continuing to be more aggressive with it. As everybody on the call knows, we've had a membership program in terms of fuel rewards for years. Now customers don't have to pay for that, and they get the rewards incrementally for free, obviously, and that's something that's been very successful and very successful on sharing value with customers and creating additional customer loyalty, which is something that we've done for several years. So thanks, Kelly, for your questions, and thanks to everyone for your questions. Before we close today, I'd like to start with just a moment of silence and remembrance of the lives lost during the tragic events that occurred on September 11, 2001.  Thank you. As you know, I usually take time before we end our call to share a few final comments directed toward our associates. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to challenge and change our country, not the least of which is the loss of lives in America and around the world. I appreciate our associates for doing their part to keep our customers and each other safe, especially for leading by example by consistently wearing masks.  We are incredibly confident in terms of the future and the things that we do to take care of our associates and customers. And together, we will get through COVID-19. Thank you for your time today, and have a great weekend. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Rebekah Manis, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Rebekah Manis : Thank you, Gary. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussion will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger assumes no obligation to update that information. Both our third quarter press release and our prepared remarks from this conference call will be available on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question, if necessary.  I will now turn the call over to Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen. W. McMullen: Thank you, Rebekah. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. With me today to review Kroger's third quarter 2020 results is Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip. When restrictions were set in place to address the spread of COVID-19 in mid-March, many underestimated the length of time that it would last and the number of families and communities that would be impacted. Many of the stories from the last 9 months have been upsetting, to say the least. Out of this grief, we've also seen the best parts of human nature. From our store teams to our warehouse associates and drivers and our digital teams, plants and offices, our Kroger family of associates have been nothing short of incredible during this period. I am proud of our dedicated associates who have continued to diligently execute our Restock Kroger transformation while serving our customers when they need us most.  We delivered strong results in the third quarter. Customers are at the center of everything we do and sales remain elevated, and we continue to grow market share as we enhance our competitive moats, Fresh, Our Brands, Data & Personalization and Seamless. I want to highlight that Kroger's digital sales are incrementally profitable today, partly supported by our rapidly growing digital media business and partially fueled by our constant improvement in operational efficiency. This is true as an incremental pass-through rate of sales, and we have a clear path to continue improving digital profitability. Gary will touch on this more in a few minutes, but I wanted to call this out as well because it demonstrates the strength of not only our Seamless offering, but the overall Kroger ecosystem and how the components parts fit together to deliver value to our customers and our shareholders.  We are more certain than ever that the strategic choices and investments made over the last 3 years have positioned us to meet the moment. And as a result of our strong performance and consistent market share gains, we are raising our guidance for the remainder of the year. We are also positioned to deliver beyond 2020 for our customers, associates and shareholders as we believe a number of the impacts of COVID-19 will be structural and lasting.  As a result of the pandemic, we continue to see increased basket sizes and fewer customer visits. Customers across the country are still staying home and cooking at home is now part of the new routine. We are fulfilling our customers' growing demand for premium products as they seek joy and elevated experiences. We're merchandising in new ways to both meet that demand and inspire our customers to trade up to items like premium jumbo blueberries, and by the way, they're delicious, and larger-sized packages of strawberries, raspberries and grapes. Home Chef's culinary innovation is inspiring customers with new oven-ready entr\u00e9es and sides, flat bread, pizzas, salads and sandwiches. In the Fresh soup category, we have introduced new flavorful and delicious Simple Truth and Home Chef varieties. Our efforts are also driving strong market share gain in -- growth in packaged produce, fresh prepared foods and specialty cheese.  This is also where our brands really shine. Our multi-tiered brand portfolio positions us well to deliver against our customers' diverse needs and desires. Our Brand grew at 8.6% in the third quarter, and we grew market share. Private Selection grew over 17% and Simple Truth grew nearly 15%. These are incredible numbers and demonstrate that while many competitors offer private label products, Kroger's unique approach to Our Brands is a differentiator in a competitive moat. By leveraging our unique data and customer insights, we continue to be at the forefront of product innovation and new product development. During the third quarter, we launched 250 new items, the most ever in a single quarter. New items for the quarter included launches in trending focus areas such as fresh produce, frozen grocery and expansion of our Simple Truth plant-based collection, unveiling more than 50 new fresh and flavorful plant-based foods at affordable prices.  Moving now to our third competitive moat, Data & Personalization. Many retailers have transactional data, but no one has the customer data and the insights that Kroger has. The quality of our data is a massive advantage because it allows us to develop a significant alternative profit business that generates income from the traffic while benefiting our customers. Our personalization efforts motivate our customers to continue to show interest in Kroger's communications, where nearly 80% have asked to receive relevant information and offers from us. Our customer e-mail open rate is nearly 18% higher than the industry average, which illustrates our ability to offer relevant content and offers to our customers. We continue to advance our personalization technology. About 95% of customer interactions with product on our website and app are enabled by personalization, driving a significantly higher level of engagement in our offers and nearly doubling the likelihood of adding an item to a cart.  Our store's competitive moat is Seamless. Kroger began investing in digital several years ago to build a seamless ecosystem that would deliver anything, anytime, anywhere. As part of our journey, we have been evolving our fulfillment network. First, taking advantage of our existing assets, our physical stores, providing flexibility and proximity to our customers with broad and relevant assortment to meet their needs. Second, expanding our network of assets and capabilities with a portfolio of various-sized facilities optimized based on volume, demand profile and density, leveraging scale and automation to meet the rapidly changing customer needs.  Our early investments lay the foundation, including over 2,200 pickup locations and over 2,450 delivery locations, which allowed us to capture the increased customer demand for e-commerce offerings during the pandemic we have today, reaching 98% of our customers with a seamless customer experience around in-store shopping, pickup, delivery and ship-to-home modalities. We are innovating and building out a flexible network of fulfillment options and working with key solutions providers. As we recently announced, we continue to progress on our Ocado facilities program with plans to build customer fulfillment centers in Michigan and in the south region of the country. The upcoming opening of our first 2 fulfillment centers in early 2021 in Monroe, Ohio and Groveland, Florida in collaboration to leverage some of their in-store fulfillment capabilities. We work extremely hard to ensure that we have the right talent, teams and structure in the right focus areas in our core supermarket business and our alternative profit businesses. We are focused on both developing, training and promoting internal talent and hiring external industry executives, which together drives our retail supermarket business as well as our other businesses. Kroger has been investing to raise the wages of our frontline associates for the last several years. As part of Restock Kroger announced in 2017, over the period of 2018 to 2020, Kroger will have invested an incremental $800 million per year in associate wage increases. As we've noted before, this is $300 million more than the original planned investment. As a result of our continued focus on growing associate wages, Kroger has increased its average wage rate to over $20 per hour with our comprehensive and best-in-class benefits, including health care, paid time off and retirement included. As the largest grocery retailer in America, Kroger is committed to being a force for good in the communities we serve. Our purpose to feed the human spirit continues to guide how we operate our business, care for our communities and deliver value to all of our stakeholders. Since launching our ambitious Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social impact plan in 2017, we achieved our goal to donate more than 1 billion meals to feed hungry families in our communities by 2020. We also continue to increase Kroger's diversion of waste from landfill, reaching 80% diversion last year on our path to achieve 90% diversion or Zero Waste. This year, Kroger outlined several new long-term environmental commitments and they can be found in our annual environmental, social and governance report. Last month, we were proud to be included among the world's sustainability leaders, recognized by our inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for the eighth year in a row. We are committed to continuing to integrate ESG metrics into our business strategy, driving shared value for our associates, customers, communities and shareholders. Since March, we have invested nearly $1.3 billion to both reward our associates and to protect our associates and customers through the implementation of dozens of safety measures like installing protective partitions and physical distancing floor decals. We continue to require masks and limit the number of people in our stores to allow for physical distancing and ensure frequent and proper cleaning procedures are followed. We also promote additional ways to shop using pickup or no-contact delivery. Our total COVID-19 incident rate continues to track below the rate in the surrounding communities where we operate. Our supply chain remains strong and healthy, and we are replenishing our stores daily so that the supplies and products our customers need are readily available. To ensure our customers have access to what they need, we have proactively secured an additional 5,000 truckloads of inventory and increased distribution capacity reserves by 20% within our supply chain to get ahead and avoid potential supply disruptions.  Furthermore, we have flexed our national footprint by dynamically shifting volume from constrained facilities and regions to facilities and regions with available capacity to accommodate. As America's grocer, we continue to see the unique opportunity to be part of our customers' healthy journey in addition to being their grocer of choice. Throughout the pandemic, we have remained committed to helping people live healthier lives by offering in-clinic and at-home COVID-19 testing solutions, supported by our team of experienced health care professionals. The size and scale of our health care footprint with over 2,200 pharmacies and 220 clinics in 35 states provide us the unique ability to efficiently facilitate COVID-19 testing and immunize a large portion of the U.S. population once vaccines become available. Kroger Health has conducted over 250,000 COVID-19 tests since April and has recently launched rapid antibody tests, which are now available across our family of pharmacies and clinics. We are also partners in the federal -- with the federal government effort to deliver hundreds of millions of potentially life-saving vaccines to our communities. We have also partnered with dozens of state health departments in preparation for the other early administration of vaccines to priority populations. Once an FDA-authorized vaccine is available, we're committed to making it accessible in accordance with the federal rollout plan. All our pharmacies and clinics are staffed with professionals, licensed pharmacists, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and technicians. Health and wellness is a critical part of our customer value proposition. Pharmacy customers are more loyal, spending 3x more per customer. We have approached pharmacy from an omnichannel perspective for quite some time, allowing customers to choose the most appropriate channel in which to connect with us, whether that be in-store, on the phone or online. For all channels, our strategy is consistent : simplify health care by creating solutions that combine health, wellness and nutrition. I continue to be proud of the work that our associates do to serve each other, our customers and our communities. Stories of their accomplishments and selflessness inspire me every day. The investments we have made to enhance our competitive moats are paying off and as a result, we are growing market share.  I will now turn it over to Gary for more details into the quarter financials. Gary? Gary Millerchip : Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. The Kroger team delivered strong results in the third quarter and provided a further proof point of the value creation model we shared at our Investor Day last year. We grew market share and, consistent with our value creation model, were disciplined in balancing significant investments in our customers and our associates with improved productivity and accelerated growth in our alternative profit businesses. The investments we are making in our business are allowing us to deliver strong results today and, importantly, are also setting us up to deliver sustained growth in the future. I'll now provide more color on our third quarter results. We delivered an adjusted EPS of $0.71 per diluted share, up 51% compared to the same quarter last year. Kroger reported identical sales without fuel of 10.9% during the third quarter and continued to gain market share. Our identical sales growth increase was broad-based and all departments, excluding fuel, achieved positive growth over the prior year. Meat and produce departments led the way, continuing to underscore the importance of Fresh and how we differentiate in quality and assortment for our customers. Digital sales grew 108% in the third quarter and contributed approximately 4.6% to identical sales without fuel. Customer engagement with our digital solutions is driving overall loyalty. When customers engage with both our physical stores and digital channels, they visit more frequently and, on average, spend twice as much as those who shop in store only. The vast majority of our digital customers are shopping in-store as well as online. We are, therefore, confident that the seamless experience we are building across our store and digital ecosystem position us well for continued growth in a post-COVID world.  At the same time, digital sales growth in the quarter was profitable on an incremental basis, and we continue to improve digital profitability by lowering the cost to fulfill a pickup order and accelerating digital advertising revenue. As Rodney noted, we see a clear path to further improve digital profitability by leveraging our personalization tools to increase basket size and improve sales mix, further reduce the cost to fulfill an order via process improvements and automation, and continue to grow digital media revenue. We are also excited about the value our merger with Home Chef has brought to our digital capabilities, both in terms of the extended meal solutions offered for our customers and the significant sales growth and profitability improvements the business is achieving. Adjusted FIFO operating profit for the third quarter was $871 million, up 33% compared to the third quarter of 2019. We were pleased with our ability to consistently pass-through the benefits of elevated sales in the quarter, which was in line with our expectations and guidance previously shared.  Gross margin was 23% of sales in the third quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased 2 basis points compared to the same period last year. We achieved improvements in gross margin during the quarter through sourcing efficiencies, sales leverage and growth in alternative profit streams. These tailwinds were offset by changes in the sales mix as a result of COVID-19 and continued investments to deliver greater value for our customers, ensuring we sustain long-term customer loyalty and position the business for success in 2021 and beyond. The OG&A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items, decreased 30 basis points. This reflects sales leverage and strong cost control through execution of Restock Kroger initiatives, which more than offset continued COVID-19-related investments to protect the health and safety of our associates, customers and communities and increased incentive costs. We were pleased with progress on our Restock Kroger cost-saving initiatives in the quarter and continue to be on track to achieve the targeted $1 billion of savings in 2020. As an example, through the implementation of multiple process and technology improvements this year, we have been able to reduce the cost to fulfill a pickup order in-store by double digits compared to the same period last year, while at the same time improving the customer experience by significantly reducing customer wait times. Fuel remains an important part of our strategy to drive customer loyalty. Consistent with market trends, our decline in gallons in the third quarter slowed to around 13%. We remain well positioned within our markets due to our fuel procurement practices and our market-leading reward program. The average retail price of fuel was $2.15 this quarter versus $2.62 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin in the third quarter was $0.37 compared to $0.30 in the same quarter last year. Kroger's alternative profit businesses are built on a platform that leverages our supermarket traffic and data. Our alternative profit businesses had a very strong third quarter, led by tremendous growth in our digital media business, Kroger Precision Marketing. On the strength of growth in digital sales, digital customer engagement and new inventory, KPM achieved revenue growth of over 190%. Over 1,200 brands are now engaging with KPM as a better way to invest marketing dollars that were previously being spent with advertising platforms and digital media companies. CPG brands continue to leverage our audience intelligence for more effective brand building activations that are achieving better return on ad spend. Thanks to our team's nimbleness and responding to the challenges presented by COVID, our alternative profit businesses are performing well, and we now expect profit growth to exceed $100 million for the fiscal year 2020.  We continue to believe alternative profit will be a major accelerator of our model in the future and COVID-19 has not changed the long-term profit expectations previously shared as part of Restock Kroger. We continue to invest in our associates as a key part of Restock Kroger in a variety of ways, including investments in wages, training and development. As you know, for the last decade or more, Kroger has sought opportunities to address the funding challenges facing the multi-employer pension plans in which many of our associates participate. We believe charges related to pension funding can be mitigated if plans are reviewed and addressed over time. In July, we announced a tentative agreement to improve security for future retirement benefits of over 33,000 Kroger family of company associates across 20 local UFCW unions with a pretax investment of nearly $1 billion that will be satisfied by installment payments over the next 3 years. I'm pleased to say that, that agreement is now being ratified by participating union locals and Kroger will incur a charge to net earnings during the fourth quarter of approximately $0.98 per diluted share on a GAAP basis. This does not affect adjusted net earnings per diluted share results for 2020, which are provided on a basis that excludes adjustment items such as this contribution. We ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW covering associates in Las Vegas and Dallas during the third quarter. Last week, we ratified a new labor agreement with the UFCW covering associates in West Virginia, and we are currently negotiating with the UFCW for contracts covering store associates in Little Rock, Houston and Arizona. Our objective in every negotiation is to find a fair and reasonable balance between competitive costs and compensation packages that provide solid wages, good quality affordable health care and retirement benefits for our associates. We strive to make our overall benefit package relevant to today's associates. Our financial results continue to be pressured by health care and pension costs, which some of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local unions and the international unions, which represent many of our associates, on the importance of growing our business in a profitable way which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhanced job security for our associates. Turning now to financial strategy. We continue to generate strong free cash flow and remain committed to our previously communicated capital allocation framework. We are continuing to invest in the business to drive profitable growth while also maintaining our current investment-grade debt rating and returning excess free cash to investors via share repurchases and the growing dividend over time. We now expect total capital expenditures to range between $2.8 billion and $3.2 billion in 2020. This lower range is primarily due to the expected delay in when spend will occur as a result of COVID-19. We are being disciplined in how we deploy capital to ensure that our investments will deliver strong returns, and we continue to see many opportunities to invest in the business to support sustainable long-term revenue and profit growth consistent with our CSR goals. Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 1.74 compared to 2.5 a year ago. This is below our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Our strong liquidity reflects our elevated operating performance and significant improvements in working capital. This improvement in working capital includes the impact of temporary increase in warehousing and buildup of inventory during the third quarter that Rodney referenced earlier, which we implemented to minimize supply disruptions as a result of higher COVID cases forecast over the winter months. During the quarter, Kroger repurchased $304 million of shares under its $1 billion board authorization announced on September 11, 2020. Year-to-date, Kroger has now repurchased $989 million of shares. In June, Kroger increased the dividend by 13%, marking the 14th consecutive year of dividend increases.  Finally, I'd like to provide additional color on our guidance for the remainder of 2020. As we shared previously, the COVID-19 pandemic has changed the outlook for food retail, and we continue to monitor, evaluate and adjust our plans to address the impact to our business. As a result of our continued strong sales and market share performance and the expectation of sustained trends in food at home consumption for the remainder of our fiscal year, we are raising our full year 2020 guidance. For the full year 2020, we now expect total identical sales without fuel to be around 14%. We expect to achieve adjusted EPS growth of approximately 50% to 53%, and adjusted free cash flow of $2.8 billion to $3.1 billion. Our guidance contemplates continued investments in the customer and ongoing COVID-19-related costs to protect the safety of our customers and associates, balanced with continued execution of cost-saving initiatives and growth in alternative profits.  Looking towards 2021, we believe that our performance will be stronger than we would have expected prior to the pandemic when viewed as a 2-year stacked result for identical sales without fuel growth and as a compounded growth rate over 2020 and 2021 for adjusted earnings per share growth. We remain confident in our business model and our ability to achieve consistently attractive total shareholder returns. We look forward to providing detailed guidance for 2021 and updating you on our road map to deliver long-term growth in March next year. And now I'll turn it back to Rodney. W. McMullen: Thank you, Gary. We are executing against our strategy even during the pandemic and continue to grow market share. The strong underlying momentum in our core supermarket business and acceleration in the growth of our alternative profit business demonstrates that we are successfully transforming our business model to deliver consistently strong and attractive total shareholder return in 2020 and beyond. Now we look forward to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : I wanted to ask around e-commerce. It doesn't look like it's getting an explicit call out as a headwind, even though it's sort of doubled in terms of sales. So can I ask you where it's showing up in the P&L? And then a bigger question, presumably sales will normalize a bit in '21, but we think -- or I don't know if you think digital will still be elevated, so how does that manifest itself in the P&L for next year? W. McMullen: Yes. Thanks, Simeon, for the question. If you look at e-commerce, as Gary and I both mentioned, incrementally, it is profitable this quarter on the incremental growth, and it was driven by the continued improvement in reducing the costs to serve our digital customer and the incremental growth in media. And as both of us mentioned, we would expect to continue to make progress on both of those fronts. As you look to 2021, we expect -- obviously, the digital growth won't be as much as it was in 2020, but we would expect for the customer to continue to expect and want digital service. But the thing that, to me, is inspiring and great to see is customers that are digital shoppers generally still continue to come into the store to use -- to have an in-store experience when they want to. And that customer basically spends double what they spend if they don't.  So we really like the overall Seamless omnichannel experience that we're delivering and creating for the customer. And we would expect, as we continue going forward, that we'll continue to make progress on the profitability of that digital shopper. And then obviously, once you get past the start-up cost of Ocado and some of the micro fulfillment centers, things like that, that is significantly even lower cost than serving the customer in the store. So when we really look at all the pieces together, we love the progress we're making and we're excited about the continued progress we expect to make. We -- everything we can see, we think the pandemic has accelerated the growth or transition to digital probably by 3 years or so. It wouldn't surprise me if it dropped off a smidgen, but I think it will continue to grow from that because it is a long-term trend where a customer really expects to be able to get something in-store, pickup or delivery, and they expect to be able to bounce back and forth based on what's easy for them. I don't know, Gary, anything you want to add? Gary Millerchip : Well, I agree completely, Rodney, with your overall comments. Maybe a couple of specifics, I mean, into 2020 and 2021, just to build on some of Rodney's comments. First of all, as you think about 2020, we talked about the pass-through rates, obviously being lower on digital although being incrementally positive. So the way it would show up in our P&L is where typically on the sales growth that we're seeing this year. We might have normally seen a pass-through rate of north of 15% on a traditional brick-and-mortar sale. The blended rate between digital and store and having in the COVID cost may be coming in around 10% versus that 15% or higher. So a combination of lower pass-through rate on digital and the incremental COVID cost will be bringing down that overall blended rate. Interestingly, though, on a specific example, as you know, we took away the fee on a promotional basis during the quarter. So that would be a headwind to gross margin. But actually, the value that we're creating through media revenue is really offsetting that. So we've been able to invest in the customer while still being able to replace that revenue by offering personalized digital communications to customers that drive new revenue streams to offset that promotional activity. As you think about 2021, just one sort of -- I guess, an unusual phenomenon just to think through it, but the more improvements we make now on our digital business as we're continuing to improve digital profitability, so as we take cost out of the cost fulfillment order, as we grow the average order value through personalization, as we grow media revenue, that -- those tailwinds will be -- if we achieve them in Q3 this year, we'll get the full benefit on the whole volume next year. So actually on the same level of business, digital would be a tailwind in next year's financial model. Now obviously, as digital continues to grow, it will create some additional investment next year. But on the base level of business that we're generating in 2020 as you create the full benefit from those cost savings from media revenue, it will become a tailwind on that base level business next year in terms of improving profitability of digital. Simeon Gutman : Maybe just one follow-up, and I think Rodney mentioned also micro fulfillment will help over time. Just to clarify, the pickup that you're doing for click-and-collect or pick-up orders, all the pickup is being done by in-house employees and I think that's pressure in the SG&A line. The Instacart and the third-party partnerships, where does that show up in the P&L? Do any of your employees actually pick for Instacart? And then, big picture, the economics with some of these third parties, I guess, where is the pricing power? Is there pricing power with you with some of those partners? Gary Millerchip : Yes. Simeon, you'd be correct in the way in which our core pickup business would show up in our P&L as a lower pass-through rate is the labor associated with picking the product in the store. That's what drives the mid-single-digit pass-through rate versus the sort of high-teen rate, if you like, on a traditional brick-and-mortar sale. We have a fairly unique model, I think, with Instacart. They are our predominant partner. We do use other partners as well in terms of delivery. So part of that business of Instacart is still delivered through the Kroger ecosystem. So the customer would come on to kroger.com or the Kroger app and would order a grocery delivery. Instacart would pick that product for us, but we're managing it through the Kroger ecosystem. So a significant part of our volume would flow through there. And then, of course, we're compensating Instacart or another third-party for that service. And that would also appear in OG&A. So it would be a similar area of the P&L. The part of the business where Instacart is using their own digital assets and the customers going through the digital ecosystem of Instacart, that would flow through more as a traditional sale and wouldn't have the same level of impact on the P&L. We are a big partner of Instacart. And obviously, we work very closely with them to make sure we're maximizing the efficiency of the model and continue to work on where we can improve the pass-through profitability on all those modalities. W. McMullen: And we would look constantly at people to partner with to help accelerate our experiences for our customers. So the example Gary gave is just one of many different partners and some are larger companies, some are smaller companies, but it's really how do we make sure we get -- deliver for the customer the way they want it delivered for them. Operator : The next question is from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Erica Eiler : This is actually Erica Eiler on for Rupesh. So I'm not sure how much color you can provide here, but we're trying to assess what benefits you've seen on the gross margin line in recent quarters that might go away in 2021. So as we look towards next year, with the potential for some of the recent grocery boom to reverse, should we be thinking about greater gross margin pressure than a typical year as the benefits from that sales leverage reverses? And is there anything positive or negative you can call out for us next year on the gross margin line as we think about comparisons and 2021 in general? Gary Millerchip : Yes. Thanks for the question, Erica. We wouldn't, at this point, get into specifics around 2021 detailed guidance as we plan to share more color on our overall outlook for next year at our Investor Day in March and through our Q4 update when we get to that. What I would say is, in general terms, I think it's important to remember that as we talk about the investments that we're making in gross margin today, many of those are in areas that matter most to the customer around personalized promotions and value offers that really resonate with the customer in the areas that we believe will drive loyalty long term, are in the most important categories for the customer around Fresh because that's what primarily drives their decision to shop with a food retailer.  We continue to invest in advertising to grow our marketing effectiveness and share of voice. So these are the kind of investments that we've been making this year because everything we see in our data and insights says that for -- to ensure that we come out at the end of the COVID environment in a stronger position than we went in and winning market share, we believe those investments that we're making are critical to that, and they're creating increased separation from some of our traditional peers as we come towards that lapsing that time period with COVID. Many of those investments are answered at everyday low prices. So I wouldn't necessarily think of all of them as having to be incremental in 2021 versus 2020, because as we cycle those, we'll obviously be layering on new promotions next year, but they are new, and it's not one on top of the other. It's the new calendar of investments that we make. So I wouldn't necessarily think of the investments that we're making having to be dramatically different. There are certainly going to be some unique factors in the model next year when you start to see deleverage in some of the sales measures that they create some headwinds in the model that you cycle, but with the continued improvements that we're driving in sourcing, the continued improvements that we expect to drive within media revenue, within alternative profits, which went into gross margin, we still feel very good about the balance model that we've shared with you and the investment community around continuing to be able to balance investments with growing customer loyalty and driving overall earnings growth. W. McMullen: Gary just briefly mentioned it, and we'll get into more detail in March, but when you look at overall, we do see meaningful opportunities to continue through process change and take costs out both in goods not for resale, cost of goods and operating costs itself. And we'll get into more detail in March. But Gary mentioned, this year, we're on track to take over $1 billion out, and we still see opportunity in 2021 to take additional costs out while not affecting the customers' experience. Erica Eiler : Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then just -- I mean given some recently -- some recent industry developments on the online pharmacy side, can you just remind us where Kroger is at right now with its efforts on online pharmacy side? What opportunities do you see going forward here? And also, just curious what you're seeing from the consumer adoption of your existing offerings? W. McMullen: Yes. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, pharmacy customer typically spends 3x more in our stores. And the pharmacy customer, for us, we've been working hard, our whole teams have, by treating food as medicine. And we're increasingly learning how to help customers eat healthier and live healthier. And for us, it's really the 2 working together is how we help customers stay healthy. If you look at some of the different cards in terms of discount offerings, those are things that we've been offering for several years. We have partnerships with GoodRx as an example and then others. And for us, we think it's part of the overall ecosystem. We really like the fact that we're able to help customers eat healthier and tie-in food. And it appears that about half of health care costs are driven by the way people eat, and we're helping people eat healthier. And it's a partnership that we think will work well. And one of the things that we find is customers still appreciate -- they appreciate online at times, delivery at times, but they also really appreciate having a health care professional that they can talk to one-on-one to answer their questions, and that's what we're able to offer, either in-person or on telehealth. Operator : The next question is from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Kenneth Goldman : There's a decent amount of inflation up the supply chain from you, everything from corn to freight. Your net pricing, I think it's safe to say, it's already risen, thanks to reduced discounting, even if maybe you didn't pull back as much as your peers did. But I'm curious to what extent some of your vendors are asking you now to accept list price increases on their end because of inflation, and what your appetite is to take these increases and pass them on to consumers, especially as we think about the next few months. And I get it, right, you want to be competitive on price, but an argument can be made, you do have a chance to push some prices higher in a low elasticity environment, too. So I'm just curious for your thoughts there. W. McMullen: When you look at -- and I'll let Gary get into some of the details. But when you look at overall, a little bit of inflation always [ makes this ] a little easier. And we don't have [ anything ] when we have a little inflation. But as you know, we've built a business model that is strong, whether inflation is high or low or anything in between. If you look at the third quarter, inflation was a little bit lower in the third quarter than the second quarter, and that was primarily driven in the meat commodity, which was consistent with what we expected. You're going to always work with CPGs initially to try to find ways to take costs out of the system so that our customers don't have to have inflation. And it's something that every CPG, that partnership, is a different approach in terms of trying to figure out a way to minimize the impact on customers. I don't know, Gary, anything you want to add or some of the specifics on Ken's question? Gary Millerchip : Sure. Thanks, Rodney. Ken, I would say that overall, we're seeing, as Rodney mentioned, and you've probably heard us say before, we build our model based on sort of 0.5% to 1% inflation, aligned with Rodney's initial comment. We've been seeing inflation running more in the sort of 2% range, I would say, and slightly up or down, as Rodney mentioned, but generally speaking, in that kind of range. From our perspective, it's obviously hard to predict exactly where inflation goes. We don't see anything in the overall supply chain when you think about food in the system that would cause us to be dramatically different. But there are also risks, obviously, with COVID and what happened in the first quarter around meat, as Rodney also mentioned a moment ago, and there are certainly some produce categories but because of the season have had some supply shortages, too. But nothing that I would say that would take us dramatically today as we look forward outside of that sort of 2%, give or take, range. I think from that perspective, as Rodney said, we always look for ways to mitigate that wherever we can. Where it's justified and makes sense, then, of course, we look at how would that be passed on to the customer. And really, we try and disconnect between inflation and what makes sense to pass on and then our pricing investments, which are more focused on where do we believe customer is looking for the most value and what's going to drive long-term loyalty. So we really try and make sure that if it makes sense to pass to them, we'll do that. But we're always looking to identify ways in which we can really connect more deeply with the customer and build loyalty at the same time. Kenneth Goldman : That's helpful. For my quick follow-up. We are hearing some indications and seeing some indications of consumers pantry loading a little bit over the last couple of weeks as COVID has unfortunately worsened. Can you help us with what you're seeing there? And maybe what that means for the quarter-to-date trend so far in terms of your numbers? W. McMullen: Ken, you said a word and [ Todd ] is trying to help me understand what you... Unknown Executive : Pantry load. W. McMullen: Pantry load. The -- we did put in limits on certain categories early in the quarter, and it was really -- the reason we did that was because of learnings from early. And we are -- as we mentioned, we've seen people shop fewer times, but buying more when they shop. The other thing on the holidays, obviously, on Christmas, time will tell, but -- and New Year's, but people obviously celebrated the holidays in a much smaller family gatherings than what they would have in the past year.  So it's a little of all of the above that's going on. And one of the things that our supply chain team did was go and get access to additional warehouse space and then our procurement was able to buy some of the hard-to-find inventory, so that we will be there for our customers. So I would say, overall, it's pretty limited. It's a little stronger in the West than the Midwest just because of where different parts of the country are with COVID and their approach to COVID. But overall, not as much as what we saw early in the year, but some. Gary Millerchip : Ken, the only thing I would add to the second part of your question. So when you look at the cadence of sales, last quarter I would say relatively consistent throughout the quarter, give or take a percent within the -- where we landed at the 10.9%, as Rodney mentioned. We certainly saw some variability by West versus Midwest. The West being more elevated, I think, because of some of the greater restrictions that were in place. As we look at the trend in the current quarter, it will be very similar in -- quarter-to-date in Q4 versus where we ended in Q3. What would be interesting there would be, though, is -- and Rodney alluded to this, was in the first couple of weeks of the quarter, we'd have seen more of that elevated spend in the weaker Thanksgiving, while in any normal environment the week would have been an outstanding week. It wouldn't have been at the same level as sort of a COVID typical week that we've seen. And so the blend of those 3 weeks gets you to looking very similar to where we were in Q3. And I think to Rodney's point, one of the things that the reason that we've left the guidance range out there is, clearly, we're expecting continued tailwind from executing our strategy and seeing COVID trends continuing food-at-home. But understanding how exactly the holidays play out when you've got 2 more holidays, a bit like Thanksgiving with Christmas and New Year still to come, and then Super Bowl actually fall into our fiscal year this year, whereas it did in the fiscal Q4 last year, and that has a fairly significant impact on sales as well. So how our customers spend holiday gatherings and how big their basket sizes are and how that behavior plays out is still something that will be, I think, interesting to see and evolve over the coming weeks and months. Operator : The next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. Mark Carden : It's Mark Carden on for Michael today. So you noted that you're continuing to take market share. Assuming this is relative to other retailers, where do you think it's coming from? Is it largely from small traditional players? Mass merchants? Another channel? A little more color here would be helpful. W. McMullen: Yes. As you know, we never really looked at market share in terms of where it's coming from. And we do everything we can to expand the market and then how are we doing within that market. So we think the market share is pretty broad-based. We're getting it by our existing customers spending more with us. Some of that is driven by our digital offerings in the seamlessness of the digital offer. Some of it's driven because we are getting new customers into our ecosystem, both digitally and in-store. So it's really very broad-based in terms of where it's coming from. Mark Carden : Okay. And then as a follow-up, any update on the Walgreens initiative and whether you're looking to accelerate expansion there? W. McMullen: I would say we continue to learn. We really aren't yet in a position where we would decide whether to expand or whatever. It continues -- the customers react positively, but we are continuing to learn how to better and deeper connect with the customers. So happy, but still early on. Operator : The next question is from Greg Badishkanian with Wolfe Research. Spencer Hanus : This is Spencer Hanus on for Greg. My first question is, can you talk about how you think price investments are driving share shifts in this operating environment today? And are you seeing promotions becoming more important today than they were 3 or 6 months ago? And sort of how you're thinking about that as we head into 2021? W. McMullen: Yes. If you look overall, and I'll let Gary get into more on some of the specifics, we just think it's important. Obviously, there are some customers whose financial situation continues to be very strong and growing, but there's other customers that their financial situation's been more pressed, especially as they've been affected in COVID in different ways, on losing jobs and things like that. We just believe, when you look at long-term, that it's important for customers to understand we did not take advantage of them during COVID. And we continue to invest both in everyday pricing and promotional pricing, and as Gary mentioned, like waiving fees for pickup, things like that, to try to help customers' budget to go further because we just think it's one of those things where the customer is going to appreciate everything that we've done during COVID, when we get out of COVID.  The other thing, and I mentioned it in my prepared remarks that I'm so proud of the Kroger team is if you look at -- we've continued to make good progress on our Fresh dimensions, our Friendly dimensions relative to our competitors. And when you look at all of those things together between a seamless experience where a customer can go online, in-store, incredible Fresh experience that's better than they can get with our competition. And with great pricing and incredible promotions, we just really see no reason that customers would shop anywhere else. Gary Millerchip : Yes. I think you covered it well, Rodney. The only point I would add, and you said it a moment ago, but as we look at the data over a longer period of time, and obviously, none of us have been through something like a pandemic like this before, but we look at periods where customers go through different economic conditions and different environments, whether that be through short-term, natural disasters that we manage or through a longer-term economic cycle. And our learnings over time are that it's really important to stay true to your values, and it's really important to continue to deliver what the customer expects consistently because over the longer term, it really does show through. And we think that's going to be very important to deliver on that expectation that we have to come out of COVID-19 stronger. Spencer Hanus : Great. That's really helpful. And then switching to online. Can you just give us an update on the basket size for online orders and how that compares to in-store orders? And would you expect that gap to widen over time? And then just an update on the incrementality, how incremental are online orders today? W. McMullen: If you look at the basket size, it's significantly higher. Over time, I've always assumed that it will get smaller as the customer gets more comfortable with shopping multiple channels. But I would say, take 10 of us, what average our average guests together, and that will probably be the closest that -- Gary, do you want to answer the last? Gary Millerchip : Yes. I would say, on incrementality, we're seeing -- and I mentioned some of this in my prepared remarks, but we're seeing very similar consistent patterns in incrementality. It would still be north of 50% in terms of when we look at what customers are buying, when they engage with us digitally. And then we look at it for a longer period of time and look at the categories and the products they were buying from us before engaging in digital, and you combine the total purchasing behavior between store and digital for that customer, we're seeing new categories and new products, and there's a -- on the basket that Rodney mentioned, it was significantly higher. The north of 50% of that basket is incremental when we look at the customers' shopping behavior over a longer period of time. Operator : The next question is from Karen Short with Barclays. Renato Basanta : This is Renato Basanta on for Karen. So I wanted to follow up on next year, pretty high level, with respect to how you're thinking about the P&L. And appreciating sort of some of the color you've given already. If IDs are down mid-single digits next year, our math implies something like 200 basis points of margin deleverage. I mean you presumably lose some COVID costs and you had some cost savings flowing through. But I'm not totally sure that, that makes up for the deleverage. So just wondering if you could help us think about the P&L in that scenario? Specifically, what sticks in terms of COVID costs next year? And then any color on any other P&L levers you have to pull? Gary Millerchip : Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. I think overall, we think about -- I wouldn't get into specifics on the sales numbers because we're going to talk about those, as we mentioned, in our Investor Day. But we do believe when we look at customer behavior and how it's changing and some of the structural changes we're seeing and when we look at in previous economic downturns, which we think they'll still be, as Rodney mentioned, some customers that are going to continue to feel the economic impact of COVID for some time to come. That we would expect our 2-year stack sales to be above the traditional level that our model is built on because of how we're connecting with customers, how we're growing market share and some of those external factors. As you think specifically around the puts and takes in the model for next year, the areas where I think it would be important to be thinking about, and we'll be sharing more again in March when we provide that additional color, we would be expecting a significant amount of nonrecurring costs into next year, if you think about things like rewards and incentive plans, paying out based on performance in the business. If you think about some of the onetime costs we would have incurred in the early part of COVID. Even if you look at the run rate costs that we're incurring now versus the earlier part of the year, they would be significantly lower as we've optimized our plans and adjusted and by the back half of the year, I'm sure we're all hoping that a vaccine will be in place that starts to change the environment somewhat as well. So we would absolutely expect certain costs not to flow through into next year. We would expect our profit to continue to be growing. We -- that's not a business area where we expect to see a slowdown in momentum. We continue to see tremendous opportunity for growth. As you know, we've shared, I think, through Restock Kroger on cost savings, we'll deliver $1 billion this year. We delivered $1 billion in 2019 and 2018. They're all incremental on top of each other, and we wouldn't expect that to be the end of the story on cost savings either. So we would be expecting to share additional plans in next year for how we're going to drive continued cost out of the business. And in the health and wellness space, Rodney mentioned it, but COVID vaccines is certainly an opportunity. But even just more broadly, the pharmacy business, while we've continued to grow our business successfully, it has definitely had some impacts of customers visiting the doctor less frequently and therefore, new scripts being added as would be a headwind versus what potentially becomes a tailwind next year. To your point, we would still expect and contemplate some COVID cost to carry over into next year. We would expect to be continuing to invest in the business, as we always do, to drive loyalty and drive long-term market share gains. We would think fuel will be a headwind likely next year, too, just because of some of the unique circumstances in Q1 this year when you think about the Russia, Saudi Arabia incident that caused prices to get completely in an odd position that drove margins at a level that we're unlikely to repeat.  So I think there's a lot of moving parts in next year, and that's why we think it's important that we provide you with a much fuller picture in March when we feel like we've got clarity on what the full picture looks like for next year. But overall, we feel very confident in our ability to -- on a 2-year basis, the earnings per share growth on a compounded rate and ID sales growth, though, to be ahead of where we would have expected our TSR model we shared in November last year. Renato Basanta : Okay. That's great color. And then just wanted to get your perspective with respect to labor costs. You mentioned you're all-in average wages. But can you give some color on what your actual entry-level wages and how many associates are actually at that level. And presumably, the federal minimum wage could go to $15 an hour. So wondering how you're thinking about managing that possibility for next year? W. McMullen: Yes. We have very few of our associates at minimum wage, and about 90% of those are younger than 18 years old or 18 years and younger. So it's people who -- it's their first job. And as you know, we have a ton of people that come to work for us as a job and then make it a career. And we want to make sure that we're providing great career opportunities for people's income can continue to improve. We are -- whatever the federal minimum wage is, we're comfortable with that. We don't take a position on that because as long as our competitors have the same costs as we do, we're very comfortable on operating on an even ground. We -- it's always not good when we have a cost they don't have. So we don't take a position on federal minimum wage, and we view that, that's the politicians' responsibility. As I mentioned, and as you know, as part of Restock Kroger, we originally included $500 million for incremental pay increases. And so far, we've actually done $800 million of incremental pay increases for our associates in addition to providing great benefits for paid time off, sick vacation and other things. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Rodney McMullen for any closing remarks. W. McMullen: Thank you for your questions today. I wish all of you and your friends and family happy holidays, Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year and encourage you to stay safe. At Kroger, our purpose is to feed the human spirit, which means that we are called to do more and help make the lives of those around us better. When we see our associates, customers and neighbors affected by systematic racism, discrimination and injustice, we are called to speak out and act in accordance with our values. Over the past several months, we've listened closely to our 0.5 million associates in countless communities across the nation to learn what we can do better to accelerate and promote greater change and equity in our workplace and the communities we serve. We recently shared our framework for action, diversity, equity and inclusion plan. This plan is just the beginning. We are approaching this effort with humility, knowing that we can't do it alone and don't and won't have all the answers. But we are committed. I am committed to continuing to listen, to speak out and to take action.  That concludes our call for today. Thanks again for your questions, and thanks for your time. Goodbye. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Rob Quast, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Rob Quast : Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen; and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Co. assumes no obligation to update that information. Our press release and supplemental information regarding the quarter can be found on our website at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] I would also like to announce that we will be hosting a business update on March 4, 2022, in Florida with an opportunity to tour our recently opened Kroger delivery customer fulfillment center. We hope that you are able to join us. I will now turn the call over to Rodney. W. McMullen: Thank you for joining us today. We often say the holidays are our time to shine. And as we move through the holiday season, we feel great about our ability to deliver. I would like to say a huge thank you to our associates who remain engaged, energized and focused on taking care of our customers. We are incredibly proud of our third quarter results and the underlying momentum in our business. We returned to positive identical sales without fuel for the quarter. We saw triple-digit digital sales growth on a 2-year stack, and we've increased our full year 2021 guidance. Our agility and the commitment from our amazing associates is allowing us to navigate current labor and supply chain conditions and provide the freshest food at affordable prices across our seamless ecosystem. Customers are demonstrating more back-to-normal behaviors, and at the same time, are eating more food at home because it's more affordable, convenient and healthier than other options, plus you can do it as a family. This was evidenced by our Thanksgiving holiday shopping behavior. Customers engaged in larger celebrations with friends and family compared to last year. We also saw them continuing to cook at home, leading up to and during the holiday, and select more premium products to elevate the food experience. These are all reasons why we believe the food at home change is structural and not temporary. With most people consuming meals at home and grocery stores continuing to capture the majority share of stomach, it is more important than ever that we provide customers with flexibility on how they choose to shop with us. We have the right seamless ecosystem in place to meet our customers' evolving needs. Leading into Thanksgiving, 70% of consumers said that they would be doing more of their holiday shopping in the store this year. At the same time, 84% of consumers said that they will continue to shop online the same amount or more in the future. These seemingly contradictory behaviors are exactly what Kroger's seamless ecosystem was designed to accommodate. We know that inflation is having an impact on customers as well. 82% of consumers polled across the country are feeling the impact of inflation, and 1 in 4 consumers are not confident in their finances right now. We are leveraging our data and personalization to enable our customers to stretch their food dollars. We deliver value when customers need it the most with personalized promotions, big packs and dynamic holiday offerings. Our brands also offer our customers flexibility within their spending without compromising, thanks to the wide variety of incredibly high-quality and innovative products at various price points. And while price continues to be top of mind, customers continue to desire the freshest food options, and we're there for them, leading with fresh. We grew sales in Natural & Organics as customers continue to gravitate toward better-for-you options. Our fresh departments outpaced total company identical sales without fuel during the quarter as well. We had a record quarter in our alternative farming offerings, which includes new approaches to growing produce, including vertical and indoor farm operations. These offerings expand customers' access to produce picked at the peak of freshness. We are very proud to share that Home Chef became a $1 billion brand on an annualized basis in the third quarter as mealtime shortcuts and solutions, as well as new product innovations, have clearly resonated with our customers. Kroger is focused on delivering a customer-centric, seamless experience that requires 0 compromise no matter how customers choose to engage with us. We launched 3 new offerings during the quarter that support the plan to double digital sales and digital profitability by 2023. First, Boost by Kroger builds on our industry-leading loyalty program to deliver additional savings and personalized offers to our members. We are encouraged by the initial engagement in the program which is ahead of internal expectations. Second, we launched Kroger Delivery Now in partnership with Instacart. This unique convenience and immediacy offering positions us to win more trips with current customers and to bring new customers to the Kroger ecosystem by offering the largest selection of quality fresh products at affordable prices in 30 minutes. Here's what's so special about this offering. It was profitable on day 1, contributing to our goal to double digital profitability by 2023 that was announced during our 2021 Investor Day. And third, we announced a strategic collaboration with Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy Baby that will expand our current marketplace offering and provide Kroger shoppers easy access to essential home and baby products. This exclusive offering will be available through both Kroger.com and on a small-scale physical store pilot at select stores beginning in 2022. We continue to be pleased with the rollout of our customer fulfillment centers in Groveland, Florida; and Monroe, Ohio, which are exceeding internal expectations, and we are especially proud of our Net Promoter Scores, driven by our teams, delivering a world-class experience for our customers, and we're really looking forward to hosting you in Groveland early next year. Turning now to our supply chain. We feel great about our ability to serve customer needs through the holidays and beyond. This is because our teams have done such a good job, planning well ahead to maintain a full, fresh and friendly customer experience. In fact, our customers took action to prepare for today's supply chain constraints back in the spring. And a great example of leveraging learnings from operating during the pandemic, we kept the additional warehouses originally brought on to support business through COVID to ensure we were able to provide for customers throughout the holiday season as well. Because of our team's agility, we are better in stock today than we were a year ago, and we were able to serve customers through the Thanksgiving holiday with items they needed for their celebrations. In fact, we increased our year-over-year pickup fill rate by over 130 basis points during the week of Thanksgiving. We chose to incur significant costs in our supply chain during 2021, which has allowed us to provide our customers today and into 2022. We continue to deploy a wide array of tools, including our owned and operated fleet, and we're working closely with suppliers to mitigate pain points for the customer. We are eager to welcome thousands of new associates to our organization as we began an incredible holiday season. Our hybrid hiring event last month contributed to the hiring of over 64,000 new associates during the quarter. We continue to invest in our associates by expanding our industry-leading benefits, including continuing education and tuition reimbursement, training and development, health and wellness and continued investments in associate wages. As we reflect on the 1-year anniversary of our Framework for Action in response to racial injustice across the country and in the communities we serve, we are pleased to share our progress with you. Over 405,000 associates have completed diversity and inclusion training. We've increased our strategic hiring partnerships with Historically Black Colleges & Universities and Hispanic-serving institutions from 6 to 17. The Kroger Co. Foundation has awarded more than $3 million in grants to support innovative organizations focused on building more equitable and inclusive communities, and we increased Kroger's diverse supplier spend by 21% to $4.1 billion last year alone and remain on track toward our long-term goal to spend $10 billion annually with diverse suppliers by 2030. While we know that there is more work to be done, we are energized and look forward to keeping our stakeholders updated on our progress. One of Kroger's greatest strengths is our ability to manage our business successfully in every operating environment. We remain customer obsessed and focused on operational excellence to deliver for our customers, associates, communities and shareholders. With that, I would like to turn it over to Gary to take you through our third quarter financials. Gary? Gary Millerchip : Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. As Rodney shared this morning, Kroger delivered strong results in the third quarter, highlighting the flexibility of our business model in a dynamic operating environment. Our focus on execution, combined with our disciplined approach to balancing investments in our associates and customers with strong cost management and growth in our alternative profit business, is positioning us well for the future. Over time, our model has proven to be resilient during different economic scenarios, and this was true again during the third quarter as we grew the top and bottom lines while navigating higher product cost inflation, a tight labor market and supply chain constraints. Our identical sales without fuel in the quarter returned to positive, growing 3.1% as we delivered for our customers across our seamless ecosystem, and customers, again, signaled higher food-at-home consumption is here to stay. Adjusted FIFO operating profit and adjusted EPS both increased year-over-year and grew by compounded annual growth rates of 22% and 29%, respectively, versus 2019. Third quarter EPS was impacted by 2 unusual items that were excluded from our adjusted EPS result. First, we engaged in an annuity buyout and lump sum distribution transaction related to the company's consolidated retirement benefit plan which will reduce future administrative costs. This triggered a write-off of deferred losses and a nonrecurring noncash charge of $87 million on a pretax basis. This company pension plan is currently 100% funded as a result of previous action taken to freeze the plan and protect benefits for our associates. This transaction was fully funded by assets in the plan. The second unusual item was Kroger recording a nonrecurring benefit of $47 million or $0.07 per diluted share, primarily due to the favorable outcome of income tax audit examinations, covering multiple years. This amount is also excluded from the company's adjusted net earnings per diluted share result for the third quarter. I'll now provide more detail on our operating results in the quarter. On a 2-year stack basis, our identical sales without fuel increased 14%. We also saw digital sales increased 103% on a 2-year stack. As we have previously shared, we do not expect digital growth to be linear, especially as we cycle last year's sales spike and customers become more comfortable shopping in store again. The launch of several new digital offerings, which Rodney outlined earlier, in addition to the rollout of new customer fulfillment centers, gives us confidence in our ability to deliver against our growth targets for digital sales and profitability. We look forward to sharing more detail on our digital road map at the business update in March that Rob noted earlier on the call. With regard to digital profitability, we continue to make progress during the quarter and achieved our best cost to serve on record for pickup orders. Gross margin was 21.66% of sales for the third quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased 41 basis points compared to the same period last year. This decrease primarily related to higher supply chain costs and continued price investments, partially offset by sourcing benefits. Our investment was in line with expectations and fully funded by cost savings and OG&A improvement. Recognizing recent inflation trends and our outlook for the rest of the year, we recorded a higher LIFO charge for the quarter of $93 million compared to $23 million in the prior year. This increase represents a $0.07 headwind to EPS in the quarter versus 2020. The operating, general and administrative rates decreased 49 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items. This improvement was achieved even with continued investments in our associates and growth in our average hourly rate and reflects the outstanding work our associates are doing to execute cost-saving initiatives in a very dynamic environment. We remain on track to deliver $1 billion of cost savings during 2021. Our alternative profit business had a record third quarter and remains on track to deliver the high end of our expected range of $100 million to $150 million of incremental operating profit in 2021. We saw increased strength in Kroger Personal Finance results during the quarter, and Kroger Precision Marketing introduced a new programmatic advertising marketplace to unleash first-party targeting and measurement capabilities, further highlighting our ability to differentiate in the advertising space. Fuel is also an important part of our overall value proposition and a key offering to help customers stretch their dollars, especially in times when fuel prices are high. During the quarter, we saw a significant increase in the number of customers actively engaging in our fuel program. Gallons grew in the third quarter by 5%, outpacing market growth. The average retail price of fuel was $3.24 this quarter versus $2.15 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.42 compared to $0.37 in the same quarter in 2020. I'd now like to spend a couple of minutes providing some additional perspective on how we are proactively managing inflation. We are currently operating in a more volatile inflationary environment. And during the third quarter, Kroger saw higher product cost inflation in most categories. We are being disciplined in managing these increases. Our teams are doing an excellent job, working to minimize the effect on our customers and our financial model by using our data and working closely with our suppliers. We are passing along higher cost to the customer where it makes sense to do so. In some key areas, we are choosing not to pass through cost increases and continuing to invest in value for the customer. We are investing where it matters most, using our proprietary data to be strategic in our pricing and personalization with the objective of winning long-term customer loyalty. We also believe our brands is an -- is an even more important differentiator for Kroger in an inflationary environment, offering customers an unmatched combination of great value and great quality. Turning now to our financial strategy. Kroger is operating from a position of strength and continues to generate strong free cash flow as evidenced by our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio hitting an all-time low of 1.68 in the third quarter. While we continue to see attractive opportunities to invest in the business, to widen our competitive moat and drive sustainable revenue and earnings growth, our capital expenditures in 2021 are now expected to be below our original guidance range of $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion. This is because of delays in project implementations, primarily due to COVID-19-related supply challenges. Kroger continues to return cash to shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased $297 million of shares, and year-to-date, have repurchased $1 billion of shares. Since 2000, we have now returned more than $20 billion to shareholders via share repurchases at an average price of $16.45 per share. As of the end of the third quarter, $511 million remains outstanding under the current Board authorization announced on June 17, 2021. We look forward to sharing more about our plans for future deployment of excess cash to drive sustainable growth and create value for our shareholders at our business update in March. As Rodney mentioned, we continue to invest meaningfully in our associates. In addition to the $350 million of hourly rate investment already planned this year, we have committed to further investments in the fourth quarter, which equates to an incremental $100 million on an annualized basis. During the third quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for associates in our Columbus and Mid-Atlantic divisions, covering over 4,500 associates. We continue to negotiate contracts with the UFCW for store associates in Houston, Lake Charles, Freeport, Dallas meat, Little Rock, Memphis, Portland and Denver. Our financial results are pressured by inefficiencies in health care and pension costs, which most of our competitors do not face. We continue to communicate with our local and international unions, which represent many of our associates about the importance of growing our business in a profitable way, which will help us create more jobs and career opportunities and enhance job security for our associates. I'll now turn to our expectations for the remainder of 2021. Driven by the momentum in our third quarter results and sustained trends in food at home, we are raising our full year guidance. We now expect identical sales without fuel for the full year to be between negative 0.4% and negative 0.2% and a 2-year identical sales stack of between 13.7% to 13.9%. There remain some uncertainties as we look ahead, and our guidance of positive ID sales excluding fuel of between 1.5% to 2.5% in the fourth quarter reflects this. We expect adjusted net earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $3.40 to $3.50. We expect our adjusted FIFO operating profit to be in the range of $4.1 billion to $4.2 billion, reflecting a 2-year compounded annual growth rate of between 17% and 18.4%. The midpoint of our adjusted EPS range for 2021 now equates to full year results, approximately in line with our 2020 results, despite cycling the unique COVID-19-related demand spike last year. Our guidance fully reflects the investments in our customers and associates I shared earlier, plus increased marketing to support the exciting new digital initiatives we launched in the third quarter. It also reflects the latest projection for LIFO. And because we recorded a LIFO credit in the fourth quarter last year, LIFO is now expected to be a $0.13 headwind to EPS in the fourth quarter. Overall, we are very proud of our results, which are projected to be significantly ahead of where we originally guided for the year. In conclusion, Kroger is executing against its key financial and operational initiatives and continues to invest in strategic priorities that will deliver attractive and sustainable total shareholder return of 8% to 11% over time. We believe our business is emerging stronger through the pandemic and through the investments we are making is well positioned to grow beyond 2021. I'll now turn it back to Rodney. W. McMullen: Thanks, Gary. Kroger's strong year-to-date results are the outcome of our customer obsession, our incredible associates who bring our vision and values to life and our commitment to bringing fresh, affordable food to everyone. The strength of our teams have never been more apparent. With every new challenge, they raised to the occasion, whether by implementing solutions to minimize supply chain disruptions, delivering the freshest produce to our customers or using our data to offer personalized promotions that surprise and delight. Our team is bringing our competitive moats to life. Now we look forward to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow : You've obviously done a very good job of passing on inflation to consumers while shielding that at the same time. Your gross profit dollars are up now. Can you talk a little bit about what came -- what drove that outperformance versus your expectations last quarter? Because last quarter, I think you were pretty cautious on gross margin. And then secondly, I think there's another big tranche of pricing coming in January from a lot of your vendors. How would you characterize that next tranche? Is it an unusually high acceleration? Or is it just kind of a continued acceleration similar to what you've seen so far? Maybe if you could even put it into context of CPI for us, it would be helpful. W. McMullen: Okay. Rob, I'll start, and I'll let Gary get into more of the details. First of all, I think it's important to remember what's allowing us to continue to invest in the customer and value is the great work our team is doing on cost reductions. And as Gary mentioned, we're on track to take $1 billion of cost out, and this is the fourth year in a row that we've been able to accomplish that, which really gives us the flexibility to be able to continue to invest in our customers. The other thing that our teams have done a nice job on, if you look at our procurement team, they've done a nice job of identifying opportunities to save money by working with our suppliers, and we continue to aggressively work in partnership with them. If you look at inflation during the quarter, it continued to increase throughout the quarter. As of right now, it's starting to stabilize but obviously at a pretty high rate. So it's something that we aggressively use our data to understand, and we aggressively try to make sure that the customer has alternatives to be able to stretch their budget as well. And that's -- in some cases, that's switching to a cheaper price meat. In some cases, it's buying our brands which has amazing quality as well. So with that, Gary, I'll let you get into more -- some more of the details for Rob. Gary Millerchip : Sure. Thanks, Rodney. Thanks for the question, Rob. Yes. I would say, Rob, obviously, when we guided at the second quarter, we said that the gross margin contraction could be similar to what we were seeing in Q2. And I would say the dynamics that are in place haven't changed dramatically. Obviously, it's a dynamic environment that we're managing, and our goal, as Rodney mentioned, is to continue to find sourcing benefit and savings to offset the cost increases where we see them and to pass on pricing where it makes sense but also to keep investing in the customer. And I'd say that we -- in Q2, we were doing that. In Q3, we've continued to do that. Supply chain would have been a similar sort of headwind in Q2 and Q3. I would say we were successful in mitigating some of the cost increases in shrink during the quarter, which helped during the quarter, although we still think shrink is a dynamic metric to manage based on some of the organized crime that we see in shrink. But overall, we were pleased with the progress in shrink during the quarter. And I think, for us, we kind of guided, while we never get into specific numbers on individual gross margin and OG&A metrics because, as Rodney mentioned there, our goal is to be dynamic in managing it, ensuring that we're delivering sustainably for our customers and growing loyalty while also being able to improve profitability over time by managing the different levers across selling growth rate, cost of goods savings, taking cost out of the business and continuing to grow alternative profit streams. So I think it's a dynamic environment we continue to manage. I think somewhere between the Q2 and Q3 range is where we think that we're operating right now. We think Q4 would likely be similar to what we've seen in Q2 and Q3. And as I mentioned in my prepared comments, we are increasing some advertising in the fourth quarter to support the accelerated growth in some of those new initiatives. So I think, again, I wouldn't be guiding to a specific number, but in the range that you've seen in Q2 and Q3 is where we feel comfortable in managing the business and driving the right balance of sustainable growth for shareholders while continuing to win customer loyalty over time. Robert Moskow : And just a quick follow-up. I think Rodney said that you're seeing your inflation kind of leveling off. Are you looking at like PPI inflation there? Because I would agree with you, it seems like in the low teens, it's leveling off. Is that what you're looking at? W. McMullen: Yes. We would be looking at more of our own costs in terms of what we're incurring and what we see coming forward. And one of the other things that I always think it's important to remind people, we manufacture a lot of our own products, so we also understand the raw materials themselves and what's going on there. And we would be looking at CPI and PPI both. But in terms of trying to estimate inflation, we would be looking at our actual cost increases that we're incurring. Operator : The next question is from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Kenneth Goldman : Rodney, I'm glad you mentioned the fact that you make your own products because that's a good lead into one of my questions, which is we're still seeing, at least in the scanner data that we get, some pretty poor trends on top of last year's poor trends for store brands in general. I'm not talking about Kroger. I'm talking across the measured industry. And I'm just hoping for an update for what you're seeing there. I know you've talked about this a little bit in the past, but are there any signs of improvement from that? And again, I know you're somewhat agnostic you'll make money either way. I'm just trying to get a sense for what the outlook is, what you're seeing, any updates from your side. W. McMullen: If you look at our brands, if you look at the third quarter trends, they were better than the second quarter trends. And if you look within the quarter, it improved during the trends. Ken, the point you made is, for us, we want to make sure we have the products customers want. So a Kroger brand item has to earn its right on the shelf, just like any other brand. But for us, it's obviously one of our competitive moats. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, and we did a press release earlier in the quarter, we were proud that Home Chef became our fourth brand on -- that is over $1 billion a year. Our brands, for us, is incredibly important on our connection with our customers because it's an incredible great value for our customers with amazing quality. And when you look at Simple Truth and Private Selection, both of those brands offer something that's unique in the marketplace and continue to grow aggressively. Private Selection, most of the items are things that you can't get somewhere else, and Simple Truth just makes it super easy for a customer to eat healthy. So the trends are improving. But for us, it is an incredibly important part of our overall strategic strategy and a competitive moat. Kenneth Goldman : And then quick follow-up. I think you mentioned that you're not passing on cost increases fully in either certain categories or certain products. Is it safe to assume that, like many of your peers, you're a little more hesitant to take pricing up on items that draw people into stores on a regular basis, things like milk and bread, et cetera? Or is it a little more strategic and nuanced than that? Just trying to get a sense for how you're thinking about which items to take pricing up on and which not. W. McMullen: Yes. We would be using our data and our historical data over the last several years on elasticity by category and by products within categories on deciding what to pass through or not. We would also -- just on certain products, it's an opportunity to create deeper loyalty, some of which is obvious, some of which is not. And some of the items in the past wouldn't have the same amount of penetration across households as what they used to do. So it really is dynamic information that's based on what's going on right now in the market. The other thing just to -- our data would also show in different parts of the country some of those elasticities would be different. I don't know, Gary, anything you'd want to add to that? Gary Millerchip : No. I think you've covered it well. W. McMullen: Okay. Thanks, Ken. Operator : The next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Michael Kessler : This is Michael Kessler on for Simeon. Can you hear me? W. McMullen: Yes. Michael Kessler : First, I wanted to ask about any initial thoughts, if you have any, on 2022, another good quarter in Q3. It looks like the full year is going to end up basically a retention or maybe slight growth off of 2021 on earnings. So I guess any more confidence or conviction that next year could be another, call it, algo type of year on both IDs and EBIT? And I guess any puts and takes as you're starting to think through that outlook? W. McMullen: It's a good question, and we appreciate it. Obviously, we'll get into a lot more detail when we get out to our March Investor Day. That's really when we'll go into depth. We're in the middle of going through -- developing our budgets and partnering with our Board on our 2022 expectations. The only comment that I would give in depth is, as we shared in our Investor Day in 2019 and we've continually updated, over time, we would expect a TSR of 8% to 11% on an annualized basis, made up of earnings growth and free cash flow, made up -- and returning cash to shareholders. So overall, we would expect that. We do feel good about the momentum in the business in terms of the connections with the customer, our seamless business processes on identifying ways to take cost out, so we can invest some of those cost savings in our associate wages, cost savings and the customer connection and other things. So -- and the business continues to generate good cash flow. Gary, it looks like you want to say something. Gary Millerchip : Well, I think you said it well, Rodney. I would just add where you were going. I think we're -- hopefully, we've been conveying very clearly, while we won't be getting into detailed guidance for 2022 because that's the first of March meeting, we've been trying to be clearing all of that communication, I think, around the confidence we have in the long-term prospects of the business, so not specific to '22, but thinking as we're continuing to build the business from the base that we've established through COVID that the opportunity to grow and deliver on that TSR commitment that Rodney mentioned. And specifically, we do believe that some of the food-at-home trends that we've talked a lot about. We've said for some time and continue to believe that data shows that a number of those changes will be structural in nature, and we'll continue to see sustained trends in food at home. I think if you look at our performance over the last 2 years that Rodney was alluding to some of the individual drivers, but I think it's demonstrated in our mind the confidence in the value creation model that we're creating, the balance in our model to be able to drive sustainable growth. And the alternative profit stream is continuing to grow at double digits off a higher base. So certainly, I would endorse Rodney's comment more broadly around that commitment to TSR over time. But obviously, we'll get into more details on 2022 in March. Simeon Gutman : And it's Simeon for the follow-up. I thought maybe Michael might have a better shot at the '22 question than me. But my follow-up is on the puts and takes on IDs. It looks like it held pretty consistent, Q2 to Q3, and you talked about inflation lifting but leveling. Can you talk about anything, puts and takes sequentially got worse or better in terms of units, traffic, et cetera? W. McMullen: If you look at most pieces, it would -- third quarter would have been better than second quarter. If you look at household trends, if you look at -- basket size would have been a little bit smaller but not significantly. We continue to see people -- premiumization during both the quarter. We continue to see people buying larger pack sizes on just about every category. So when you look at the puts and takes, I think there's as many puts and takes. Gary Millerchip : Maybe just to add, Rodney. Yes, Simeon, I mean, the trends were pretty consistent through the quarter in Q3. They got slightly better as the quarter went on, and we would be trending at the top end of the range that we shared in the quarter-to-date so far, top end of the range that we shared for guidance for Q4. And if you look at the trend so far in this quarter, I would say that the quarter would have started a little bit slower because of -- we were cycling in that week before Thanksgiving a fairly large spike in consumer behavior that I think started to signal maybe a potential increase in cases this time last year, and then Thanksgiving was very strong. We were very pleased with the results over the Thanksgiving week itself. I think some of the questions in our mind as we look towards Q4 that are some of the reasons that we guided to some of the uncertainties, it's hard to predict exactly what will happen with government stimulus dollars in the market, particularly at the state level. That's kind of really hard to get over the skin of what will happen in individual states around ongoing funding. We obviously know there are some continued supply chain challenges around product availability in certain categories, and that's getting better gradually but still has certainly some challenges in the market. And it will be those kind of things that, for us, would be the puts and takes in how strong Q4 plays out in our mind. Operator : The next question is from Robbie Ohmes with Bank of America Global Research. Robert Ohmes : I guess, Gary, for you, could you -- I wanted to just follow up on the sourcing benefits to gross margin. Can you remind us what you're doing to achieve kind of sourcing benefits in this environment? And also, you're doing an amazing job with the cost savings initiatives, offsetting labor and other cost pressures. Can you remind us also there, what you've been doing? And maybe some thoughts on how sustainable those 2 things could be into next year? Gary Millerchip : Sure. Thanks for the question, Robbie. Yes. We're really proud of the team's work in those areas, as you mentioned. It started out at the beginning of Restock Kroger. There is a sort of let's grab the opportunities that are immediately in front of us, and I think it's really become a core competency within the organization to drive sustainable savings in our model. On the sourcing side, I think I would describe it across a number of different areas. You start with how do you make sure you're consolidating all the buying in the right places, so you can maximize the data and knowledge and use our own experiences from the cost of commodities and the fact we manufacture many of our products so that we're getting smarter and more effective in how we buy. It's evolved into product design and packaging design and how do you really optimize the value while not compromising on quality for the customer, so continuing to drive value in those areas. It's extended to the GPO partnership that we created with Walgreens and looking at how can you consolidate opportunities and best thinking there as well. So it continues to evolve for us, and the team is doing a great job in finding those opportunities to maximize savings. And we would expect that to be a continued opportunity for us because we keep identifying new innovative ways to ensure that we're designing for value and maximizing opportunities to be more efficient.  On the sort of the OG&A side of things, that's across a number of different areas as well. So it would include using technology and automation to reduce shrink and waste in the business, to improve on some of those activities in the store and our operations that are very manual and don't really maximize the value that our great associates can deliver for customers, so taking that non-value-added work out wherever we can to allow our associates to focus on the customer. It includes automating our ordering and production planning-type processes. One of the big ones, of course, this year that we think would expect to be a tailwind into next year as well for every dollar that we can capture this year would be taking cost out of our digital cost to serve. So we've invested significant labor over the years in building that digital ecosystem, and we'd expect to continue to grow that business, of course. But if we can take out -- if we can improve efficiency on that $10 billion digital business, it creates not just a saving on the next new sale, but it creates a saving on that baseline $10 billion business as well. And then finally, I would say we've taken the opportunity to use things like the learnings through COVID on things like administrative costs and where are there areas you can actually work more efficiently and operate in more of a hybrid environment to take cost out of the model as well. So I hope that gives you an idea of the way it's kind of really become embedded more in the business, and we certainly would expect as part of our overall TSR growth model to be continuing to take costs to be able to fund investments in our average hourly rate for associates, to be able to invest in pricing and value for the customer while at the same time growing shareholder returns. W. McMullen: Robbie, the only other thing I would add to Gary's comments, and it's implied throughout Gary's comments, but we have done a lot of people changes -- talent changes, both in terms of recruiting people from within the company but external as well outside of the industry that have skills that were different than traditional in our industry, which has been a huge help in both areas for us to think about things in new ways and for people to approach things in new ways as well. Robert Ohmes : That's great. That's really helpful. And one really quick follow-up question, if I may. With the changes you're making on the sourcing side and with own brands, can -- what is happening with total SKUs versus national brands SKUs versus owned brands SKUs in your stores? Are they shrinking? Are some growing? Can you give us any color on that? W. McMullen: If you look at before COVID, the number of SKUs would be lower now than before, just because it's -- you don't have as much change time and things like that. There are selective areas where some of the national players haven't reintroduced some of the variety that we are introducing some of that variety in our own brands, and we introduced over 200 new SKUs in the quarter, and we would have an aggressive pipeline going forward. But overall, if you look at -- there's still continued SKU growth in natural organics, plant-based areas like that. And you will -- and if you think about like paper towels and paper goods and things like that, you would see fewer SKUs, just because the customers move to purchasing bigger-size packages. Operator : The next question is from Greg Badishkanian with Wolfe Research. Spencer Hanus : This is Spencer Hanus on for Greg. I just wanted to ask how you're thinking about the delta between retail and cost inflation in '22. And then what is the breadth and depth of promotions that you need to hit your long-term top line targets, just given the unique opportunity the industry has had to reset promos over the last 18-plus months here? W. McMullen: Gary, you want to... Gary Millerchip : Sure. Yes. Thanks for the question, Spencer. As we mentioned, we're kind of not really providing sort of an outlook for 2022 at this point around how we think about sales and investments overall. We'll be doing that, for sure, as we get to the March meeting and sharing our Q4 results. I think, really, I would pivot back to some of the comments that we made earlier around we think very much of it from the perspective of in all operating environments, Kroger has been able to demonstrate our ability to navigate through those situations. And it really comes back to what we were talking about earlier around ensuring that we understand the customer better than anybody, using our data, our targeting, our promotional activity and our personalized pricing, and of course, where the pricing structure of product starts to change, really ensuring that customers see the value in our own brand products because of the great quality and value that they offer in combination. And during times of high inflation and certainly in times of economic challenge, we found that Kroger has performed very well, and we've seen customers pivot to some of those opportunities based on the way we can communicate and connect customers with those strategies. So I think from our perspective, we're very much managing the business dynamically to ensure that we can deliver for the customer, but at the same time, deliver on our TSR commitments in the way that we talked about earlier in the conversation. W. McMullen: On promotions, we would always use our insights because different types of customers react different types of promotions. So we would aggressively use our insights to personalize promotions. A lot of that is one-on-one with a customer, either sending an old-fashioned mailing or electronically with e-mail or text or whatever. And it really depends on each customer and what do they test react to. Spencer Hanus : Got it. That's helpful. And then in the prepared remarks, I think you mentioned that the Ocado facility is performing better than expected, the one in Florida. But could you just provide some more details on the basket size and the repeat orders relative to your targets? And then how are you thinking about the need, longer term, to build or acquire stores in that market to provide a more complete omni experience down there? W. McMullen: Yes. On your second question, I'll answer it first, and you got to walk before you run. So right now, we're totally focused on making sure that the sheds open strongly, and we continue to maintain outstanding NPS scores, or net promoter scores, with our customers. And I am super proud of our team in Florida and Monroe, both in terms of how they continue to connect with the customer and continue to improve. If you look at basket size, the basket size continues to grow. And what we expected and what we believe is as the customers begin to trust the experience, begin to have good experiences, we get a higher share of their total spend. And that's what we're starting to see. And when you look at overall in Florida, one of the reasons why we announced the 2 additional facilities in Florida is obviously the connection and the growth that we are achieving. So far, we feel good about the opportunity in Florida. And as everybody knows, the population growth in Florida and the economic growth in Florida is just mind-boggling relative to an awful lot of the country. So it's an incredible opportunity for all grocery retailers in Florida. Obviously, the offering we have is unique in the market and very proud of what we're getting done there. Gary Millerchip : And the repeat usage, Rodney, is higher than we expected, right, than net promoter score. W. McMullen: Yes. Operator : The next question is from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : Rodney, let me start with -- if you would -- how consumer behavior has evolved over the last couple of years. In terms of what percent of purchases, right, are done, shelf price versus promo versus personalized promo. How has that shifted, right? And if you think about personalized promo, is that as much as 50% or something along those lines of what purchases are occurring? And then the work you've done on price perception, how has that trended maybe early days of COVID to where we are today? W. McMullen: If you look at customer behavior, I want to broaden it a little bit on -- relative to your question. We continue to see people focus on health. If you look at early in COVID, people were not as focused on health, but they're definitely back where they're focused on health in a more aggressive way. All across the board, you see premiumization on what people do. And I always say I'm a reasonably aggressive shopper in our Murray's Cheese. Growing up, I would have never had really good cheese. And once you have a really good cheese, it's hard to go back to what you were used to when you -- before. And what we're finding is customers, when they upgrade and try higher-quality product, they find out they love it, and they become loyal to it. If you look at customers in terms of behavior and buying on promotion, it's been reasonably consistent throughout the pandemic. People stretch their budget where they need to or want to because -- and they will splurge in other places, which is one of the things that -- from a go-to-market standpoint that we really try to help a customer stretch their budget on things that are important to them, so they can splurge on what's important to them as well. John Heinbockel : All right. Maybe just a quick one for Gary. You guys now have something on the order of $4 billion to $5 billion, right, of dry powder in terms of your leverage target. How do you think about that conceptually in terms of timing, in terms of return to shareholders versus strategic M&A. What's the philosophy there? Gary Millerchip : Yes. Thanks, John. Obviously, we are really proud of the business performance, and it has demonstrated strength in the overall model and the position that we're in, as we said in the prepared comments. I would say our overall capital allocation strategy is unchanged, that we start with where are the opportunities to invest in capital in the business to drive sustainable growth. We're obviously in a great position around maintaining our investment-grade debt rating, and we've been able to make some good progress on chipping away at the pension funding from an overall sort of debt and potential liability there as well. This year, of course, we've been very committed to continuing to return cash to shareholders with the $1 billion, so far, on buybacks and the 17% increase in the dividend that we announced earlier in the year. So I think we've been very consistent with that plan so far. We do think that in the short term, it's important to maintain some flexibility, recognizing some of the uncertainty in the market that we've all talked about, that we're all navigating through at the moment. That being said, within those principles, we do think it's important, and we've been very committed, as you know, as a company, to being very disciplined with cash flow and deploying it to either grow the business or return to shareholders. So as we head towards 2022 and as we move towards the March planning meeting and the business update meeting that Rob shared, we'd certainly expect to share more color of how we're thinking about the excess cash and some of the opportunities we're exploring there. W. McMullen: And we would continue to look for things that are the right opportunity for things that add capabilities. So if you think about merging with Home Chef a couple of years ago, it was a capability that we didn't have on the direct-to-customer meal kits, and we've been able to partner with the team there to leverage it back within Kroger as well. So -- and I always think it's important to remind people that we're not required to do any kind of mergers in order to achieve our TSR of 8% to 11% as well. Operator : The next question is from Chuck Cerankosky with Northcoast Research. Charles Cerankosky : Great quarter. Rodney, I think, as you earlier mentioned, that you chose to incur some significant costs in the -- to bolster the supply chain in the quarter. Can you give us some detail on that and whether they last into next year? And then I have a follow-up related to that. W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at the supply chain investments, it was pretty similar to what we did in the second quarter. Now our team has done a nice job of starting to identify some opportunities for efficiency. One of the biggest areas is that we continue to have extra warehouse space, and I guess I hesitate to call it extra warehouse space because we're actually using the warehouse space. But -- and over time, as we feel like things are permanent, you'll see us do more permanent-type warehouse projects to expand capacity rather than using it maybe in a way that's not as efficient. We would expect to continue to do that in the fourth quarter. As we look out next year, we really are working hard to make sure we stay agile in that area because things continue to change so quickly and what's going on with COVID, what's the COVID variance and things like that. So we really are making the decisions on an agile basis, and it's one of the learnings that we've had early on in the pandemic, and we'll continue to do that relative to the supply chain as well. Charles Cerankosky : Anything on the labor side worth noting? And then also, when you're talking about the supply chain issues and product outages, is it -- are we talking about branded versus private label, fresh versus shelf-stable, edible versus nonedible products? I mean, where are you seeing the need to spend the most money and use the most management resources to make sure the shareholders that. W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at labor, we certainly have partnered with outside companies to supplement our labor resources, especially on the supply chain. If you look at in-stocks, they would be more affected on center store. If you look in the fresh departments, we would be in much better shape in most of the fresh departments in terms of in-stock. Operator : The next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. Mark Carden : This is Mark Carden on for Michael today. As a follow-up to some of the earlier inflation questions, where do price gaps stand today? And what's the posture on further investments from here? And have competitors been acting as rationally, given just the heightened inflation this time around? W. McMullen: If you look at -- as everybody knows, we go to market as a high/low merchant. So we're aggressive on promotion. We're aggressively using promotion. And we feel very good about where we stand relative to price gaps. And if you look at -- our strategy has always been to neutralize on price and win on our fresh areas and our friendliness and connection our associates have with our customers. And that continues to work well, and we continue to feel good about where we are relative to the various gaps. Mark Carden : Great. That's helpful. And then on Ocado, how integrated is the GFC today with your Cincinnati operations? Has it been integrated in click and collect yet? And then in Florida, who do you think you're taking the most share from? W. McMullen: If you look at Florida, I think the growth in the market is so strong that I think every -- all boats are rising in Florida. So to say that we're taking share away from somebody, I really don't think of it that way because I just think the market is growing so much. If you look at your first part of your question on Monroe, we continue to further integrate it within the store network. And it's something that, literally, every single week that goes by, we further integrate to really make it a seamless experience for the customer. Rob Quast : Thanks for your questions, and that will end our question-and-answer session. W. McMullen: As Rob said, thanks for questions. Obviously, thank you for your interest in Kroger. As you know, many of our associates own stock, and we always use the end of this to communicate directly with our associates as well. And as all of us embrace the holiday season, it often becomes a time where we can -- of reflection as we sit down to enjoy special meals with our loved ones. And as I said earlier, I am just so incredibly proud of our associates across the Kroger Family of Companies and what we, as a team, have accomplished this year. Everyone of our associates is helping make the holidays brighter and fresher for our customers, and more importantly, for that customer and their family. And it doesn't matter if you're making a difference together, like our Kroger Health team, who has administrated 8.5 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, or as individuals like Donna Greer, a cashier at our store 387 in Collierville, Tennessee, whose unshakable positivity has been an inspiration to many, including the Collierville Herald-Independent who just named her Collierville Woman of the Year. We are so proud of Donna, and congratulations, Donna. When you look at these, they are just a few examples of our incredible people who bring our vision and values to life each and every day. Our associates are beyond amazing and continue to serve our communities and uplift each other and our customers. That concludes our call for today. We wish everyone a happy holiday season, Merry Christmas and encourage you to stay safe. And as always, thank you for your interest in Kroger. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Rob Quast, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Rob Quast : Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen; and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Co. assumes no obligation to update that information. We are excited to see that many of you will also be attending, either virtually or in person, our 2022 Business Update tomorrow in Florida when we will share additional details and answer questions about our long-term strategy and growth initiatives. More information about virtual registration for this event can be found at ir.kroger.com. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] Additionally, we would ask that you focus today's questions on our fourth quarter and full year 2021 results as well as our 2022 guidance. Now I will turn the call over to Rodney. W. McMullen: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. Our strategy of Leading With Fresh and Accelerating With Digital propelled Kroger to record performance in 2021 on top of record results in 2020. We are incredibly proud of our associates who continued to deliver for our customers through the pandemic. During 2021, our team delivered for all stakeholders by, first of all, achieving positive year-over-year identicals without fuel against very strong identicals last year and a 2-year stack of 14.3%. Also by connecting with customers through expanding our seamless ecosystem and remarkable, consistent delivery of full fresh and friendly customer experience for everyone, plus investing more than ever before in our associates to raise our average hourly rate to $17 and our average hourly rate to over $22 when you include [ compensation ] and benefits as well. We balance all of these investments by achieving cost savings of greater than $1 billion for the fourth consecutive year, and alternative profits contributed an incremental $150 million of operating profit as well. As we look to 2022, we expect the momentum in our business to continue, and we have confidence in our ability to navigate a rapidly changing operating environment. We are leveraging technology, innovation and our competitive moats to build lasting competitive advantages. Our balanced model is allowing us to deliver for shareholders, invest in our associates, continue to provide fresh, affordable food for our customers and support for our communities. We remain confident in our growth model and our ability to deliver total shareholder return of 8% to 11% over time. Kroger is leading with fresh. Our fresh departments outpaced total company identical sales, excluding fuel, during the fourth quarter. Kroger remains the #1 retailer in many exciting areas such as specialty cheese, sushi and floral. As the world's largest florist, we sold over 76 million floral stems for Valentine's Day alone. And the smiles that came along with that for our customers and associates were free. We advanced our fresh strategy and strengthened our fresh offerings in 2021 by launching our Go Fresh & Local Supplier Accelerator, supporting our commitment to small businesses. As a result of the launch, we have brought a number of new products to customers, and the initial results have exceeded our expectations. We are still early in the program, and we will continue to partner with small businesses to expand our pipeline of new products. We also remain a leader in innovation through exciting partnerships with companies like Kitchen United and Kipster. We've completed the initial test phase of our End-to-End Fresh initiatives focused on bringing more days of freshness to our customers and are confident in its scalability and with plans to expand to targeted stores across the country. Our brands continue to resonate strongly with customers and maintains a culture of innovation, launching over 660 new items during the year. More than half of those new items were within our Simple Truth and Private Selection portfolios. We accelerated Home Chef's incredible milestone of becoming a billion-dollar brand, our fourth greater-than-$1 billion brand, which is pretty special. As a reminder for everyone, we merged with Home Chef in 2018. At the time, we knew our customers were looking for ways to make meal time easier without compromising on taste or freshness. While Home Chef originated as a pure-play e-commerce offering, we saw immense potential to integrate and leverage it across our seamless ecosystem, scaling it within our stores and continuing to grow online. The success of this integration demonstrates our ability to integrate and scale solutions that provide value to our customers and grow our competitive moats. Kroger is focused on delivering a seamless experience that requires 0 compromise by customers, and I think that's a really important point, 0 compromise required by customers. And what that means is the freshest products at competitive prices and flexible lead times. Yael will go into a lot more detail tomorrow on what 0 compromise means for our customers at our business update. The strength in our top line sales in 2021 demonstrates our ability to meet our customers no matter how they choose to engage with us, whether it's in-store or online. At the same time, we are actively encouraging customers to engage with us on our digital platforms, even when shopping in store. That's because when a customer engages with us digitally, they spend more with Kroger within all modalities. We continue to attract new customers to our digital platforms. During the quarter, we saw new seamless pickup and delivery to household acquisitions increased 25% compared to the third quarter. We remain committed to doubling digital sales and profitability by 2023, which was announced in 2021. We look forward to sharing our glide path to this goal with you tomorrow. We do not expect digital growth will be linear, especially as we cycle the sales spike in 2020 and customers become more comfortable shopping in store again. We are incredibly proud of the new digital modalities we launched during 2021, including Kroger Delivery Now, our Boost membership program and the rollout of new customer fulfillment centers, all of which we expect to contribute meaningfully to our long-term goals. Yesterday, we announced a new customer fulfillment center for the Cleveland region, following on heels of our announcement of a cross-dock spoke facility that will serve Oklahoma City. And just a few weeks ago, we opened our third customer fulfillment center in Forest Park, Georgia and are leveraging learnings from Monroe and Groveland to drive efficiencies and scale in the new facility. Customers are loving this new offering, and we continue to be pleased with the initial rollout of our facilities in Groveland and Monroe, and we look forward to sharing additional insights tomorrow. Now turning to the supply chain. Our teams across our stores, warehouses, plants and offices have been incredible in working together to supply fresh food and necessities for our customers while addressing the rapidly changing environment. During the quarter, industry challenges continued within the supply chain, and we remain confident in our ability to navigate these challenges. Within our supply chain, we continue to deploy a wide array of tools, including our owned and operated fleet. We are also partnering with our suppliers to improve product availability using the strength of our data science teams to provide insights that shorten lead times and optimize inventory flow across the extended supply chain. We continue to focus on expanding our transportation contracts and attracting carriers from outside our industry, which has kept product flowing predictably across our network. The teams are doing a great job managing the increased costs, and the trends within our costs are improving sequentially. We are using our data and supplier data plus leveraging technology to support future growth. We expect the supply chain to continue to improve throughout the year as a result of our actions. When I visit our stores, I often hear from our associates that what they love most about their job is that they can positively impact the lives of our customers, communities and each other every day. And it's also what I love about our business too. And it's what makes our purpose, to Feed the Human Spirit, so vital for our people. One way we live our purpose is through progress toward our ESG goals and our commitments. As part of our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social and environmental impact plan, last year, Kroger donated 499 million meals, that's right, 499 million meals, to feed hungry families across America. And we continue to make progress toward our goal of 0 waste. As part of our commitments to helping people live healthier lives, we've administrated almost 11 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine through Kroger Health. For our more than 450,000 associates, we strive to create a culture of opportunity, and we take seriously our role as a leading employer in the United States. Kroger has provided an incredible number of people with their first jobs, new beginnings and lifelong careers. As we continue to operate in a challenging labor market, we are dedicated to attracting and retaining the right talent across the organization to be able to continue delivering for our customers. We are investing more than ever before in our associates by expanding our industry-leading benefits, including continuing education and tuition reimbursement, training and development, health and wellness as well as the continued investment in wages that I mentioned earlier. This is enabling us to navigate current labor conditions while continuing to provide America with the freshest food at affordable prices across our seamless ecosystem. We are cultivating an environment where all associates are able to thrive. For the fourth year in a row, Kroger earned top score in the Human Rights Campaign Foundation's 2022 Corporate Equality Index, the nation's benchmark in measuring corporate policies and practices related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality. Last year alone, we provided more than $5 million to support associates through unexpected hardships through our Helping Hands Fund. This includes providing critical funds for disaster relief for nearly 1,300 associates. 2021 was an incredible year for Kroger, and we are committed to continued growth. One of Kroger's greatest strengths is our relentless focus on learning and improving every day. I believe this has been a key on navigating our business successfully in every operating environment. We remain customer-obsessed and focused on operational excellence to deliver for our customers, associates, communities and shareholders. And now I'd like to turn it over to Gary. Gary? Gary Millerchip : Thank you, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger continues to execute at a high level and is delivering exceptional results while navigating a rapidly changing environment. Before I get into our results in more detail, I would like to start by echoing Rodney's appreciation to our fantastic associates. Their dedication to serve our customers and support each other throughout the pandemic has been nothing short of incredible. Our performance last year clearly highlights the strength of Kroger's go-to-market strategy as we achieved positive identical sales without fuel and adjusted EPS growth on top of record results in 2020. We also continued to invest in our customers and associates to ensure Kroger is well positioned for future success. These investments were balanced with over $1 billion in cost savings and $150 million of incremental operating profit from alternative profit streams. I will now provide additional color on our full year results. We delivered adjusted EPS of $3.68 per diluted share, up 6% compared to last year. Identical sales, excluding fuel, were positive 0.2% and digital sales on a 2-year stacked basis grew by 113%. Our adjusted FIFO operating profit was $4.3 billion, up 6% over 2020. Gross margin was 22% of sales for 2021. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased 43 basis points compared to the same period last year. This decrease primarily related to higher supply chain costs and strategic price investments, partially offset by sourcing benefits and growth in alternative profits. The OG&A rate decreased 61 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items, reflecting a reduction in COVID-related costs and cost saving initiatives, partially offset by significant investments in our associates. Turning now to our fourth quarter results. Adjusted EPS was $0.91 for the quarter, up 12% compared to the same quarter last year. Kroger reported identical sales without fuel of 4%, our strongest quarter of the year, with fresh departments leading the way. Kroger's FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased 3 basis points compared to the same period last year. The stability in our gross margin rate reflects effective management of cost inflation and sourcing benefits, offset by strategic price investments and higher supply chain costs. The OG&A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items, increased 7 basis points. This was driven by significant investments in our associates, including a year-end associate thank you reward and various asset impairments, offset by decreased COVID-related costs, sales leverage and cost saving initiatives. The LIFO charge for the fourth quarter was $20 million compared to an $84 million credit in the same period last year and represented an $0.11 headwind to EPS in the quarter. The year-over-year increase was attributable to higher inflation in most categories, with grocery and meat being the largest contributors. One of Kroger's greatest strengths is our ability to successfully navigate many different operating environments, and our team is doing an excellent job managing the current higher inflationary environment. We continue to leverage our data and work closely with our suppliers to minimize the effect on our customers and our financial model. We are investing where it matters most to our customers using our proprietary data to be strategic in our pricing and personalization. Our brands is also an important differentiator for Kroger in this environment, offering customers an unmatched combination of great quality and great value. Our strategic approach is helping our customers manage their grocery budgets more effectively and is allowing Kroger to maintain a strong price position relative to our key competitors. Fuel also remains an important part of our overall value proposition for our customers, and we continue to invest in our fuel program in 2021. Customers that redeem fuel points spend, on average, 4x more at Kroger and visit 4x more frequently. Our investment in fuel rewards, which is reflected in our supermarket gross margin, also helps customers stretch their dollars further and allowed us to achieve gallon growth of 5% in the fourth quarter, outpacing market growth. The average retail price of fuel was $3.30 this quarter versus $2.20 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.44 compared to $0.33 in the same quarter in 2020. Turning now to cash flow and liquidity. Our operating results generated exceptional free cash flow in 2021, which resulted in a further strengthening of our balance sheet and liquidity. Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is now 1.63 compared to our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. We were also disciplined in accelerating the return of cash to shareholders in 2021. In total, Kroger returned $2.2 billion to investors via a combination of share repurchases and dividends. I'd now like to take a few minutes to discuss our continued commitment to investing in our associates and our deep experience with collective bargaining. Wages at Kroger grew before and during the pandemic. As you know, we committed to significant associate wage investments when we launched our Restock Kroger program at the end of 2017. Kroger has invested an incremental $1.2 billion in associate wages and training over the last 4 years. In addition, we have committed to invest over $1.8 billion during the same time period to help address underfunding and better secure pensions for tens of thousands of associates. Wage, health care and pensions are included in all of the more than 350 collective bargaining agreements that cover approximately 66% of our associates. These contracts are regularly negotiated by our professional labor relations team. Our objective is to negotiate contracts that balance competitive wage increases and affordable health care for associates with keeping groceries affordable for the communities that we serve. Our obligation is to do this in a way that maintains a financially sustainable business. If negotiations do become contentious, we have contingency plans in place to continue to support our communities. During the fourth quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for associates in Fred Meyer, King Soopers and our Michigan division, covering more than 20,500 associates. For 2022, we have contract negotiations with the UFCW for store associates in Las Vegas, Southern California, Seattle, Indianapolis, Portland, Columbus, Fort Wayne, Chicago and Toledo, in addition to continued negotiations with the UFCW for store associates in Houston, Little Rock and Memphis. We are actively proposing generous wage increases over the life of the various contracts we are negotiating, and these increases are included in our financial model and our guidance for 2022. We are also communicating to local unions that coming to the table with unrealistic proposals, proposals that do not balance associate investments with keeping groceries affordable for our customers is untenable and undermines our shared goal of growing the company to create more jobs and advancement opportunities for more associates. In closing, let me now provide additional color on the 2022 guidance that we released this morning. While we recognize there remain a number of uncertainties in the economic and geopolitical outlook, we believe the strength of Kroger's go-to-market strategy and our ability to manage multiple levers within our financial model will allow us to continue to build momentum within our business in 2022. We have shared previously that we expect to emerge from the pandemic stronger, and our guidance for 2022 creates a new baseline for FIFO net operating profit that is some $900 million higher than the midpoint of our TSR model would have projected when we announced it in 2019. Our plans contemplate meaningful investments in associate hourly rates as well as investments in delivering greater value for our customers and enhancing our digital capabilities. We expect these investments and the impact of cycling COVID-19 vaccine revenue will be fully offset by tailwinds in our model and allow us to grow adjusted net earnings per diluted share to between $3.75 and $3.85. The tailwinds in our 2022 plan includes sales leverage from growing identical sales without fuel between 2% and 3%. We also expect to deliver cost savings of $1 billion, incremental alternative profit growth largely in line with 2021 and underlying improvement in Kroger Health profitability, excluding vaccine income. Fuel profitability is expected to be relatively flat year-over-year as gallon growth is offset by slightly lower fuel margins. In terms of quarterly cadence for identical sales of our fuel and EPS growth, we expect identical sales without fuel in quarter 1 and quarter 2 will be above the midpoint of our 2% to 3% range as we expect heightened inflation will continue in the first half of the year. We would expect our second half identical sales without fuel to be below the midpoint of our range as we expect the inflation to moderate later in the year as we cycle higher inflation from the second half of 2021. Regarding adjusted EPS, we would expect quarter 1 to be above the annual growth rate range of 2% to 5%, quarter 2 to be below the range and the second half of the year to be within the range. Turning briefly to our capital priorities. We will continue to be disciplined with capital allocation. As you heard this morning, we are increasing capital investments to $3.8 billion to $4 billion in 2022. This reflects some catch-up from the last 2 years, where spend was below original guidance due to COVID-related constraints as well as an acceleration of our strategic initiatives that will drive longer-term earnings growth. At the same time, we expect to generate free cash flow of between $2 billion and $2.2 billion. And consistent with our TSR model, we will continue to return excess cash to shareholders as evidenced by the acceleration in share buybacks over the last 6 months. And finally, we are looking forward to spending more time with you at our business update tomorrow when you will hear from key members of our leadership team about our strategic priorities and our path to deliver total shareholder returns of 8% to 11% over time. With that, I'll turn it back to Rodney. W. McMullen: Thanks, Gary. Kroger is operating from a position of strength, and we have a variety of levers and growth opportunities to continue to build on this strength. As we reflect on 2021, we are incredibly proud of our ability to navigate both a rapidly changing operating environment and evolving customer behaviors. We are obviously in an inflationary environment. Our teams are managing it well. And as Gary talked about, we are doing everything we can to keep prices low for customers, including our award-winning customer rewards program, which includes fuel rewards, our amazing and high-quality Our Brands products and personalized offers and savings for each customer individualized. As we look to 2022, we are confident in our ability to continue to differentiate ourselves, serve our customers in new and exciting ways and continue to change the definition of what it means to be a grocery retailer while never losing sight of what's most important to our customers. And when we do this, we have a clear path to delivering on our commitment of 8% to 11% total shareholder returns over time for our shareholders. Now we look forward to your questions. As Rob shared at the top of the call, we would like to focus all questions on our quarter 4 and full year 2021 results as well as 2022 guidance. We look forward to sharing additional details about our long-term strategy tomorrow at our 2022 Business Update. So with that, we'll turn it over for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]  Our first question comes from Rupesh Parikh with Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : Congrats on a really strong quarter. So I guess just starting out, just on the gross margin line, pretty significant improvement in gross margins on a 1- and 2-year basis. What are the key changes? Maybe some more color in terms of what drove that improvement versus what we saw in Q2 and Q3. Gary Millerchip : Yes. Thanks, Rupesh. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks and Rodney covered in a moment ago, really proud of the team in the way that we managed the business in Q4 and some of the changes that were happening. From I think what the team did, we're obviously laser-focused on how can we continue to be effective in managing the sourcing approach to how we are leveraging the relationships with our suppliers and using our data. We've been very effective in using our personalization and promotional activities to really sort of target the offers to the customer to make sure that they're seeing the value but that we're also then able to manage those cost increases effectively in the business. I think mix is also another important trend that the team is really focused on is how do we ensure that we're upselling customers to better quality products and premiumized products and whether it's adding the cedar plank to the salmon or the seasoning to the shrimp. And some of those opportunities are really important in how the merchandising team are really focused on recognizing some consumer trends in how many of our customers are moving to more meal solutions as well as continuing to look value -- look for value. So overall, we feel really good around the way the team managed our gross margin during the quarter. As we think about going forward into 2022, we continue to focus on, of course, the same elements and continue to manage those pieces tightly while also wanting to make sure we're continuing to deliver value for our customers. And I think to us, really, we look at it more of how do we manage the model overall across gross margin, OG&A and pulling the different levers. And certainly, I think we look at 2022 and think that we'll continue to invest in the customer. We'll continue to manage those different levers. I would suspect that we'll see continued investment in gross margin in 2022 and continued operating leverage in OG&A. But I think the fourth quarter is a good example of where we wouldn't expect to see some of the major volatility or the gap in gross margin and OG&A that we saw across the whole year, for example, in 2021. W. McMullen: Yes. Just a couple of additional things. During COVID, as we've mentioned several times, people have learned how to cook again. And what they're finding is that they can have restaurant-quality food that they prepare at home. And in numerous categories like the specialty cheese that I mentioned, but there's numerous categories where customers have traded up to higher-quality product. And everything that we're seeing, they continue with that. And the other thing, I think, that's always important to remind all of us is that our fresh departments grew faster than the center store departments. And our fresh departments have a higher gross rate as well versus the center store. So just a couple of additional things. Thanks, Rupesh. Rupesh Parikh : Great. And then maybe just one follow-up. So with a lot of inflation out there in the marketplace, how do your price gaps look today versus maybe where they were a few quarters ago? W. McMullen: If you look at overall, it's pretty close to the cost increases we've incurred. If you look at -- in a couple of departments strategically, it's not -- the retail price hasn't increased as much as cost, and we've been able to balance all of those pieces. But we really are using our data to make sure that we understand the elasticity of everything. We are starting to see customers engaging in coupons a little bit more aggressive than before and doing other things in terms of starting to move to our brands where they don't have to compromise on quality and they can save money as well. So we are starting to see the beginning of some behavior changes as well, but really early. Gary Millerchip : Yes. Maybe the only thing to add, Rodney. Certainly, as you know, Rupesh, the customer, as we look at our data, defines value in multiple ways. So part of it is the everyday price, part of it is the promotions. It includes our fuel rewards and all the personalization that we offer. And I would say, if we look at our position as we end the year from where we started, we feel very good about the way in which we've been able to deliver value for the customer. And when we look at our price position, we feel we've been able to maintain a very strong position with the customer in terms of how they would perceive the value of the Kroger basket and the value that Kroger's delivering. Operator : The next question is from Simeon Gutman with Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : A nice quarter and guide. My question is the comp guide is solid for next year. And we're a little surprised at how good the EBIT flow-through or the margin still looks, given all the cost pressures on the wage side. You mentioned some things on the gross margin. You mentioned tailwinds, but I wanted to put it to you holistically and hear your reaction to this question. W. McMullen: Yes. I'll start and let Gary get into some more of the details. I think one of the things that's -- to me, your question is great. But the thing that I think is really important to remember is the things that we continue to do to take costs out of our system all across everything. And we would expect to be able to take another $1 billion of cost out. And as you know, last year, we took over $1 billion out and that was the fourth consecutive year. So through process change and really, it's becoming a capability that the organization has, that's really critical to be able to afford to do some of the things that we're doing. The other thing is alternative profit and some of the other things related to that continues to change the fundamental business model in a positive way, that inflation doesn't affect the same way and the profitability of that part of the business is significantly higher than the traditional grocery store would be as well. Gary, any additional stuff? Gary Millerchip : Well, I think you summarized it well, Rodney. I think, Simeon, we feel about it as you look at our 2021 results and then you think about our guidance '22, it really demonstrates the strength in that, the overall diversity of our model now and the different levers that we're able to pull to make sure that we're investing in our associates, investing in our customers and still able to deliver a strong return for our shareholders. And we would agree with you that 2022 is a year where we do expect to make significant investments, whether it's around continuing to support the customer and drive growth in our business, investing in our associates, investing in digital. And of course, we will be cycling some COVID vaccine revenue that will be lower in 2022 than '21. But Rodney mentioned the cost savings and alternative profit benefits that we see within the model. We do continue to expect, obviously, to generate sales leverage in our model as well. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, health and wellness will certainly have some headwinds from COVID vaccines, but we believe there's continued opportunity to improve the underlying profitability in health and wellness as well in 2022. Simeon Gutman : And maybe related, the value-conscious customer, are you seeing any signs of trade down? Are you seeing customers trade out? Are you seeing any decisions in the store that lead you to see that the customer is feeling a little more pinched? W. McMullen: Yes. What the customers are telling us is that they're changing their spend behavior outside of food more than food, which obviously makes sense. They also have found that eating at home is a lot more affordable than going out to restaurants. They're able to stretch their budget this way -- that way as well.  And as I mentioned a second ago, we are seeing people starting to engage in coupons and some of those things a little more than before. But nothing substantial so far, and we really feel good about the way we're positioned with the customer. And if you look at our connection to that customer segment, it actually improved in the fourth quarter versus prior year. And what customers are finding is our fresh departments are a huge strength, and then they're able to get personalized rewards and engage with us on promotional items and things like that. Operator : The next question is from John Heinbockel with Guggenheim Securities. John Heinbockel : So Rodney, I want to start with, if you look at the $1 billion of cost takeout, right, how does that roughly break out between COGS and O&A? And how has that changed over the last 3 or 4 years? Has it shifted more to O&A or it stayed relatively consistent? W. McMullen: Yes. The -- if you look at overall, it would be more cost-driven. Now goods not for resale, do you put it in cost or do you put in COGS because you can argue either one. But it's more driven by process change and eliminating work. Obviously, sourcing is an important component of it. Goods not for resale is incredibly important as well. If you look at the mix, the mix has been pretty consistent over the last 4 years. If you look at our expectations for 2022, Gary, it would be pretty similar to 2021. I mean, it might be 5% difference but not much, right? Gary Millerchip : Yes. No, I think the only thing, John, that's really accelerated over the last couple of years, I completely agree with Rodney around the sourcing benefits and the taking cost out of the operation. The one thing that, as you know, we've talked about is we invested in digital to ensure that we're winning the customer to build that $10 billion business that we talked about. And we did that sometimes, recognizing that there'll be some inefficiency in our model. And so I think one of the areas that we've been able to accelerate is taking cost out of the digital sort of cost to serve a customer, if you like, as we can leverage more efficiency in that scale. And that's become a tailwind this year and will be -- or was last year and will be in 2022 as part of the cost structure. That's probably the one area that's maybe changed a little bit over the last couple of years, but I completely agree with Rodney. On the balance, it's pretty consistent. W. McMullen: John, Gary's last point to me is incredibly important. And everybody on the call, you've all heard us talk about job 1 is don't lose the customer as they switch to being a combination of digital and in-store. And then over time, we'll figure out a way to make that customer just as profitable as a customer that traditionally shopped in the store. So I think Gary's last point is really important. John Heinbockel : And then maybe talk about the how fuel rewards performs in an environment where price per gallon may be approaching $4, right? How it performs? And then do you do anything differently? I don't think the plan -- the program construct would change. But does it -- or does your marketing change? Because you would think in this environment, fuel rewards is way more important than it was a year or 2 ago? W. McMullen: Your belief and comment is correct. What we find is customers find it very helpful and as fuel prices go up, they engage in the fuel rewards more. Obviously, we continue to leverage fuel rewards in ways that make sense for different customer segments because different segments engage differently in fuel rewards. Obviously, we would prefer for fuel not to be at $3 or $4 a gallon, but we're going to do everything we can to help the customer stretch their budget as much as we can. Operator : The next question is from Greg Badishkanian with Wolfe Research. Spencer Hanus : This is Spencer Hanus on for Greg. I just want to follow up on the FIFO adjusted gross margins for a minute. Did you see any change in the competitive environment that allowed you to pass through more costs? We know that Walmart's U.S. gross margins were up 54 basis points last quarter. So curious if that provided an opening for you guys. And then should we look at the 4Q performance as a good run rate for 2022? W. McMullen: Yes. The first part of that, I wouldn't say that we saw it really change any differently. Obviously, Walmart is one competitor but there's numerous competitors out there. And what we're trying to do is to make sure that we're balancing inflation and helping the customers stretch their budget as much as we can. And we've continued to invest in pricing in areas that matter most to customers. So we really are -- we wouldn't consider it easier or harder. It's just part of the overall managing the business. In terms of looking forward, Gary, I'll let you answer that part. Gary Millerchip : Yes. Thanks, Rodney. Spencer, as you know, we don't tend to give detailed guidance on the puts and takes in gross margin rate and OG&A rate because we much more view it as how do we manage the business as a whole to drive sustainable earnings growth. I would say that I mentioned it in one of the earlier responses, that we would expect to continue to invest in the customer in 2022. And we'd also actually expect to see some accelerated advertising costs too because we're going to obviously continue to grow the business and we'll talk about it tomorrow, some of the digital growth opportunities that we're focused on as well. So I think as we look at the total year, we still expect some investment in gross margin in 2022, but we'd also continue to expect to see significant OG&A leverage as well in many areas through the cost savings that Rodney mentioned. And certainly, we wouldn't expect the gap between those 2 to be anywhere near as wide as it was when you look at the full year results in 2021. So I wouldn't take the fourth quarter as the sort of the number to use, but I would certainly expect us to be tightly managing those. And we do believe, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, all the work the team has done around sourcing, connecting with customers, driving our strategy to deliver value for customers gives us confidence in the overall guidance that we shared for next year. Spencer Hanus : Got it, that's helpful. And then fuel profitability is up significantly versus 2019 despite the rising prices, which is typically a headwind to that -- to profitability. So I understand that you expect profitability to be down this year a little bit. But how sustainable do you think it is, this step-up versus '19? And then could you just remind us how much operating profit the fuel business contributed in 4Q just so we can better back into how the core performed? Gary Millerchip : Sure. Yes, it's a great question on fuel. As you know, we talk about this each year, and we used to base our assumptions on a sort of a 3- to 5-year trend. And if you look at the last 3 to 5 years, really, fuel profitability has continued to improve pretty consistently as we look at the trends in our business and how our fuel reward program is connecting and what a great job our team has done in managing fuel margins. I do think there's a little bit of left pocket, right pocket in some of that, of course, as well because we spend a tremendous amount of money in rewarding customers, giving up to over $1 a gallon off for discount for customers that are highly engaged in the program. So I think it's important to remember that there are 2 dimensions to it, and we recognize that in our gross margin on the supermarket business and don't flow through on the fuel side because the redemption of those points is tied to when you spend at Kroger in the store online, not tied to specifically the fuel usage. So that's an important factor to remember. We believe that the fuel business has sustained improvement in profitability, so we're less focused on the historical trends now because we believe the industry has changed structurally. And we'd expect that to be maintained for us and also because of the strength in our value proposition with the customer. We don't specifically call out details on fuel and total profitability. I would say that actually, broadly speaking, the tailwind on fuel in the fourth quarter largely align with the headwind in LIFO, so the 2 of those pretty much offset each other during the quarter. W. McMullen: One other thing on fuel that our team -- 2 or 3 years ago, we restructured our procurement team in fuel, and they've also made progress relative to the market on cost of goods, which has been helpful for that business as well. Operator : The next question is from Michael Lasser with UBS. Michael Lasser : How much did inflation contribute to IDs in 4Q? And how much do you expect inflation to contribute to IDs in a year ahead? And as part of that, it does look like you're expecting IDs to still be positive in the second half of the year. Does that mean you expect this total number of new occasions in the second half of the year, number of new occasions at home, to remain positive? W. McMullen: If you look at -- as Gary mentioned, we would expect inflation in the second half of the year to moderate just because it's cycling the inflation from the second half of this year -- or last year, I guess, now. Overall, as you know, we operate successfully in every operating environment, whether it's inflationary or deflationary. And we're doing everything we can to minimize the impact on our customers. If you look at overall, we would expect the business to continue to grow. And part of that is really the seamless ecosystem. Altogether, what we're finding is we get a bigger part of their overall household spend. We also -- if you look at total households, we had good numbers on total households for the fourth quarter versus 2020 and 2019. And we would -- and what we find is that once we get a new customer, we're able to move them up the loyalty ladder over time because of the experience they get from our associates on the customer experience, the seamless ecosystem, fresh and good value, plus we're able to start personalized rewards for them. So we would expect to be able to move those new customers up the loyalty ladder, which would help -- be helpful in identicals as well. I don't know, Gary, anything you want to add? Gary Millerchip : No, I think you covered it well. Michael Lasser : My follow-up question is, Rodney, the percentage of gross units that are on promotion is still about 500 basis points below where it was prior to the pandemic. And prior to the pandemic, that metric for the industry has been very consistent over time. So why is it that the industry is just going to be less promotional moving forward than it has been in the past? W. McMullen: Yes. Relative to the industry, I wouldn't have as much detail on that. If you look at our revenue, our sales on promotion, it's pretty much very similar today as it was before the pandemic. It's really -- it's something we track every week or whatever. During the pandemic, there were promotions we didn't do just because there were some items you couldn't get product. And obviously, you don't want to promote an item where you don't have enough inventory to support the product. In some cases, that's still the case. But overall, our promotional activity is pretty similar to what it was before the pandemic. Gary Millerchip : I think, Michael, just to add that I think that Rodney's comments are really what causes us to believe that when we talk to our customers and look at our data, we feel we're in a very good position relative to the value that customers receiving from Kroger in this environment and our ability to continue to deliver value for our customers and maintain a strong perception as customers continue to evolve into 2022 and beyond. W. McMullen: And one of the things that I think it's important to remember, we would track internally on sales on promotion, not items on promotion. So it's volume weighted as well, I think, is an important point too. Operator : The next question is from Edward Kelly with Wells Fargo. Edward Kelly : I wanted to ask you about labor because you brought it up on the call. But can you just provide a little bit more color on sort of like what's going on, on the labor front right now? I mean, you have a very strong history of being fair, right? Like I think if we take an objective view here, that seems to be the case. But as we saw with Denver, these renewals now can be costly and there are other big contracts coming up. I guess how has the dialogue been? It does seem like you're poised to see some acceleration of inflation. I wonder if you agree with that and if you can quantify. And then what are you doing to offset that pressure, things like automation, in addition to some of the cost save stuff? W. McMullen: Yes. As you know, when we embarked upon Restock Kroger several years ago, we made the commitment that we would accelerate our associate wages. And as Gary mentioned, now we -- incrementally, it's about $1.2 billion per year that we are investing in supporting our associates. We think supporting our associates is incredibly important. And what we're always trying to do is to make sure that we have solid wages, strong wages and industry-leading benefits, which we do have and making sure that we're keeping food affordable for customers. And it's a balance that we're always trying to do. Obviously, we work with the unions, but it's -- we want to make sure that our business is sustainable for the long term and we're creating jobs long term and we're creating career opportunities. And if you look at our store directory, 70% started out as an hourly associate. If you look at department heads, almost all started out as hourly part-time associates, and those are things that are incredibly important. So it's obviously a balance. We've strategically, several years ago, decided to invest more in wages because we thought it was important to do. And what we find is, over time, it also reduces turnover. And when you have turnover reduction, obviously, the productivity of somebody that's been working for us for a couple of years is higher than a new hire. It really gets back to the cost saves that Gary and I both talked about. Literally, you're looking for every single thing where you can stock something in a different way because if you save a second across our company, it's about $14 million. So it's -- you're looking for every single thing that you can do anywhere in the store, anywhere in a plant or a warehouse to be able to eliminate waste. And we believe that we have a core competency now on how to do that. And those are things that are allowing us to make the investments in our associate wages. I think, Gary, over the last, what, 4 years, our average hourly rate is up 22%. And we've been able to obviously do that at the same time on significantly lowering our OG&A expense. Gary Millerchip : Yes. Maybe just a couple of things to add, Rodney. When Rodney talked about the last 4 years and the investment we've made, I wouldn't think of that as being the end of the journey when we announced our TSR model. We were actually fully expecting, as we look out towards 2025, that we will continue to invest in our associates and our model when we announced the TSR model of 8% to 11% growth. We actually did expect that we would continue to invest not just over '18, '19 and '20 but continue to invest '21 through 2025. So it's always been something that we contemplated in our model. We kind of felt that this was something that would come. And now admittedly, the last 12 months obviously have changed the landscape a little bit. So I would say we've pulled forward some of that thinking. And we would fully expect within our guidance that we've shared, 2022 will be a higher number in wage investments than 2021 was. So we are fully contemplating that with the guidance that we shared, and we expect that growth in wage to continue. And again, it was fully part of our TSR model. We'll talk a little bit about tomorrow. But to Rodney's point, one of the reasons that we're increasing our capital investments in 2022 beyond the sort of catch-up of some of the things that were slowed down by COVID is we are going to be investing more in technology. We still feel like as proud as we are of the $1 billion-plus we've saved for the last 4 years, we still think there's a lot of opportunity to use technology even more effectively to take more cost out of the business. And it's one of the reasons that we're accelerating capital because we believe it will help support -- continue to increase efficiency over the next few years as we continue to invest in average hourly rates. And Mary Ellen Adcock will share a little bit more color on that when we see you tomorrow as well. Operator : Your next question is from Michael Montani with Evercore ISI. Michael Montani : The first question I had was just around the ID sales that you reported. I was wondering if you could discuss what kind of cost increases you all were seeing in terms of a percentage and how much you were able to pass through. And then also what your outlook would be for that same basis for 2022? W. McMullen: If you look within the quarter, it was pretty consistent. Obviously, you'll have -- in the fourth quarter especially, you'll have some weather that drives it. If you look at so far this quarter, it would look pretty similar to last -- to the fourth quarter on IDs. Overall, on cost increases, for the most part, they were passed through but not every area within the department. So it's really balancing all of the different pieces in terms of cost increases and trying to minimize the impact on the customer. Michael Montani : And then I guess just the outlook for '22, like if we look at the U.S. FDA, they're calling for, I think, 2.5% to 3.5% full year inflation for this year. Is that a good benchmark for us to use without any better information, would you say? W. McMullen: Well, yes, we would be using the same data source. But we would expect within the year, it would be meaningfully higher in the first half versus the second half. But somebody on Gary's team probably have gotten a PhD on the amount of time that he's spent on trying to estimate inflation. And at the end of the day, you basically end up in that spot.  We would expect SNAP, just a pure number of SNAP households, to be a headwind. But what we find on SNAP is some people switch to buying items with credit card, cash and other things as well. And the other piece of our guidance would reflect in our health and wellness business. There's some third-party plans that weren't profitable that we also are going to move away from or have moved away from that's impacted our number on our guidance as well. Gary Millerchip : The only other thing I would add that -- Rodney shared this earlier in the Q&A, but we are seeing customers tell us that as inflation is certainly higher in food, which obviously we're all focused on, but inflation is obviously higher pretty much everywhere in the economy right now. And actually, whereas maybe a few months ago, customers were telling us they were eating more food at home because of concerns around COVID, some of that shifted more to -- while food at home inflation is higher, actually relative to other inflation and how I need to manage my budget, food at home is more attractive in terms of helping me be able to manage my budget and manage my dollars. So there's a lot of -- I think a lot of factors that are impacting that outlook that we're obviously using the best information we can to forecast and feel good about the guidance that we've shared and our ability to manage different levers if things change. But we recognize our crystal ball isn't perfect and we'll just continue to be dynamic in the way we manage it. Michael Montani : Great. And just the follow-up question in terms of expense outlook was in light of the $1 billion-plus of gross cost-out, is there a certain kind of ID sales level that you would need probably to leverage that you could discuss? And how much vaccine contribution did you have in '21 that needs to cycle now in '22? W. McMullen: As Gary mentioned on the vaccines, that is something we factored into the guidance overall and it's just part of the total puzzle. We would also expect some of that to be offset because we're able to provide more of the regular vaccines that we always have. And some of that focus that went on vaccines, we'll be able to acquire additional customers to offset some of that. So all of that is factored into the guidance we gave. On the identical sales, right now, as long as we can continue to get the cost out, we're able to leverage a pretty modest amounts of identical in terms of being able to leverage. Gary Millerchip : Yes, there's lots of puts and takes, as you heard us mention in our 2022 guidance overall, and we would expect there to be cost increases, obviously, from our investment in average hourly wage. And we continue to invest in the customer experience. But overall, factoring in all the elements of our model, we would expect to generate leverage and our OG&A rate would improve in 2022 over 2021 based on all the different pieces coming together in our model. So within 2022, specifically with that 2% to 3% IDs, we would expect to be able to improve the OG&A rate in the year. Operator : This will be our last question, and it comes from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Kenneth Goldman : I'll make it quick. Just to build on Ed's question. Can you elaborate a bit, if possible, on how we should think about the risk of labor this year? I was struck a little bit by how much time Gary spent on the subject and a little bit of the tone. It kind of felt like a warning to investors, frankly. So if there's any data you can provide on what percentage of your workers are up for renegotiation this year or whatever metric is appropriate, that would be great. W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at labor overall, it's something that we're proud. We're one of the largest union employers in the United States. And we're focused on providing additional -- we go in with the ability and assumption that we're going to continue to invest in our associates. And we have industry-leading benefits and we support their ability to come for a job and make it a career by feeding your future, providing tuition reimbursement and other things to help people continue to achieve a career. So we're always balancing all of the pieces. So our associates are critical to our future success. We invest in our associates and I want to make sure that we have a strong, sustainable business so that they're able to support their families as well. And there's nothing more inspiring than when you're in a store and somebody talks about -- the other day, I was at Ralph's and somebody was talking about how they were able to send 4 of their kids to college and 1 was a doctor and 1 was an attorney. And those are the kind of things that is incredibly inspiring to hear our associates talk about. Gary Millerchip : And Ken, I think just one thing to add. We are obviously trying to listen to feedback carefully, and we've got a sense that there was a desire to hear more about our overall strategy. As we shared in the prepared comments, we feel really good about the investments we have made and are continuing to make in our associates. And we have a team that's very experienced in managing those relationships. But we wanted to make sure, as we had some feedback that you'd like more color, that we try and listen to investor feedback and wanted to make sure we addressed that in the prepared remarks. W. McMullen: Thanks, Ken. Thank you all for attending today's call. We look forward to engaging with all of you again tomorrow at our business update in Florida. As I always do, I would like to conclude our call by taking a moment to address our associates who many listen in. I'm extremely proud of the things we have accomplished this year and we celebrated many significant milestones. Thank you on behalf of all our team for making Kroger better every day. I'm so proud of you. As America's grocer, Kroger is taking action to show our support and solidarity with Ukraine. Today, we are sending emergency food assistance to support refugees through a grant from the Kroger Co. Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Foundation to the UN World Food Program Ukraine Emergency Fund. We will match all gifts made by our associates and customers up to $250,000. That concludes our earnings -- fourth quarter earnings call. Thank you. And as I said before, we look forward to seeing many of you tomorrow. Take care. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] I will now hand over to your host, Rob Quast, Director of Investor Relations. Over to you, Rob. Rob Quast : Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Rodney McMullen; and our Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Company assumes no obligation to update that information. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. [Operator Instructions] In response to your feedback on allowing more participants during Q&A, we may provide abbreviated responses to your follow-up questions to hear from as many of you as we can. I will now turn the call over to Rodney. W. McMullen: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're off to a great start in 2022, delivering strong performance by successfully executing our strategy of Leading With Fresh and Accelerating With Digital. Our associates' relentless focus on providing fresh, affordable food to our customers is driving our strong results. During the quarter, we demonstrated the resilience of our business model led by strong top line sales ahead of internal expectations. In addition, our team navigated a challenging operating environment characterized by continued inflationary cost pressures and supply chain headwinds, which included higher diesel fuel costs. Through our strategic cost savings execution and sustained food-at-home trends, our team delivered 16% growth in adjusted FIFO operating profit, providing once again the strength of our financial model in a variety of operating environments. Our teams are focused on delivering a great customer experience with 0 compromise. Rising inflation, as consumers rethinking their shopping and eating habits, while customers continue to cook more, we are seeing different shopping behaviors based on how individual customers are experiencing the current inflationary environment. Many customers continue to shop premium products throughout the store, including Private Selection, Murray's Cheese and deluxe meal solutions. For other customers whose budget are more directly impacted by food and fuel inflation, they are actively looking for ways to save. We're doing everything we can to help this customer stretch their budgets. I'd like to share more about the work we're doing for our customers and how our competitive moats uniquely position us to meet these challenging and changing customer needs. First, we are leading with fresh. Our customers continue to prioritize fresh as the #1 determinant of where to shop. We are meeting their needs with operational efficiencies and new technologies that extend days of freshness and grow our selection of quality fresh products. In the first quarter, we achieved 5.2% identical sales growth in our fresh categories. These gains were led by the expansion of our End-to-End Fresh Produce program, which elevates standards and improves our ability to maintain freshness throughout the supply chain. We certified 355 stores this quarter, and the customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. We also continue to increase our use of forecasting and analytical tools, specifically leveraging 84.51\u00b0 to improve our ability to maintain fresh products in stock, both in store and online. Our recent floral results are a great example of how we are leading with fresh. As the nation's largest florist, the first quarter was our time to shine for holiday celebrations and our floral team stepped up, achieving record sales. In fact, we set an overall single-day floral sales record on Valentine's Day and a Mother's Day sales record with strong double-digit growth. Second is Our Brands. During the quarter, we saw tremendous growth in Our Brands, which had identical sales of 6.3% and outpaced all national brands. With 92% of households purchasing at least one of these products, we launched 239 new and innovative products during the quarter, reflecting many of the top food trend predictions we made at the beginning of the year. All of our new products continue to be tested and validated to ensure that they are as good or better than the comparable national brand. We continue to invest heavily in the quality of Our Brands, which preserves our strong price position and drives higher profitability. Next area is personalization. Our data science platform provides unique insights that creates personalized customer experiences. In this dynamic environment where customer behaviors are changing rapidly, we use our data and insights to be nimble and react quickly to ever-changing needs. Our broad-based data science approach helps us determine how to best implement price, promotion and display. We are focused on delivering incredible value to our customers through relevant personalized offers and fuel rewards. Our loyal customers are using our fuel rewards program now more than ever and, in fact, more than 600,000 incremental households engaged for the first time this quarter. Finally, our seamless ecosystem continues to deliver fresh products to our customers anytime, anywhere and with 0 compromise. During the first quarter, more customers returned to in-store shopping. And as a result, we made strides to enhance that experience while introducing new tools that help our associates better serve customers. In pickup, we unveiled new technology that improved wait times 20% and expanded capacity based on customer needs. In delivery, we continue to introduce key initiatives that expand our reach and shorten delivery times. We strive to provide more customers access to high-quality, affordable food regardless of whether they have a physical store in their community. During the quarter, we opened 2 new customer fulfillment centers powered by Ocado's automated Smart Platform, one in Dallas, Texas and one in Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, bringing our total CFC count to 5.  We also opened 3 new spoke locations for a total of 6 spokes. As we head into summer, our end-to-end cold solutions, including the custom-built refrigerated van, will ensure customers get the freshest product delivered directly to their doorstep. Finally, our Boost membership is delivering promising results. Our one-of-a-kind membership program offers incredible value where customers can get unlimited free delivery on orders of $35 or more, double the fuel points on every dollar spent at Kroger and other exclusive member benefits. We are encouraged by the number of new members in the 4 current pilot divisions. Importantly, delivery sales increased significantly compared to non-Boost divisions and delivery retention improved approximately 600 basis points. Because of this early success, we are proud to announce today that Kroger Boost is launching nationwide beginning in the next few weeks. This next-generation loyalty program is deepening our relationships with customers as they continue to look for value and convenience. Turning to supply chain. Our 2022 business plan anticipated ongoing supply chain challenges. By planning ahead and focusing on staffing, technology and process efficiencies, we manage our costs effectively. By owning and operating a portion of our fleet, we better control and manage transportation costs  despite diesel fuel cost headwinds. We were also proactive about forward buying and securing capacity for goods, resulting in better vendor rates. Through our supplier relationships, we saw sequential improvement in product availability. We are well positioned to adapt to the evolving environment, and we are cautiously optimistic in a broader supply chain recovery throughout the year. We also continue to invest in our associates and an associate experience that facilitates an amazing customer experience. We firmly believe that exceptional financial and operating performance connects directly to the ways we support and invest in our associates. During the quarter, we took numerous steps to meet our associates' needs while they delivered for our customers. We continue to invest in associate wages and we expect hourly wages to grow throughout the year. We launched new initiatives to simplify day-to-day work, including the modernized scheduling tool, MyTime. We took steps to improve communication across all of our teams and bring meaningful training to all of our associates no matter where they work. One example of this commitment is the addition of Microsoft Teams Rooms across most of our store locations. This technology improvement will facilitate deeper connections and improve the associate experiences. As an employer of choice, more people are applying to work for Kroger and more associates are choosing to stay with us. While we still have work to do, we experienced a meaningful improvement in both hiring and retention in the months after the Omicron surge. We are also seeing more boomerangs. These are associates who left to work elsewhere and ultimately came back to us. Kroger's strong culture invites associates to come for a job and discover a career. And we're glad that so many value and appreciate our work environment, our culture and the people they work with every day. Our winning culture is rooted in living our purpose to feed the human spirit. During the past last year, our teams took significant steps to support our customers and communities through our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social and environmental impact plan. We introduced a new Kroger and USO co-branded mobile unit to nourish active duty military service members and their families at military bases and USO centers across the country as well as provide community disaster relief. The first of 4 units hit the road in May. In summary, we're off to a very strong start in fiscal 2022. We are widening our competitive moats, creating a shopping experience with 0 compromise, investing where it matters most to our customers and associates and strengthening our purpose in large and small ways every day. When we do all of this well, our teams, our customers and our shareholders all win. Now I'd like to turn it over to Gary to take you through our first quarter results. Gary? Gary Millerchip : Thank you, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger delivered another quarter of strong results as our team did an outstanding job executing our go-to-market strategy while navigating a dynamic operating environment. Our results again highlight the strength and resilience of Kroger's financial model, which allowed us to continue to invest in our associates, deliver fresh, affordable food for our customers and create value for our shareholders. I'll now provide more detail on our results in the quarter. Led by our competitive moats, we achieved identical sales without fuel growth of 4.1%. Fresh categories and Our Brands identical sales both outpaced overall company results. Adjusted EPS was $1.45, up 22% compared to the same quarter last year, driven by increased sales and exceptional cost management during the quarter. Digital sales declined 6% in the first quarter, broadly in line with our expectations. We continue to ramp the digital growth initiatives shared at our Investor Day, including enhanced personalization capabilities, Boost membership, customer fulfillment centers and Kroger Delivery Now. As a result of these initiatives, we grew digitally engaged households during the quarter, and we would expect digital sales to accelerate as the year progresses. Gross margin was 21.6% of sales for the quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased 26 basis points compared to the same period last year. This decrease was primarily attributable to continued strategic price investments and higher supply chain costs, offset by sourcing benefits and the cycling of a write-down related to a donation of personal protective equipment inventory in the prior year. Our team continues to do an excellent job managing higher product cost inflation. We are leveraging our data and sourcing expertise and working closely with our suppliers to help minimize the effect on our customers and our financial model. We are investing where it matters most to our customers and are using our proprietary data to deliver additional value through personalization. Our Brands are also proving to be an important differentiator for our customers in this environment, providing an unmatched combination of great quality and great value. We will continue to leverage these proven and unique capabilities to help our customers manage their grocery budgets more effectively and maintain a strong value proposition relative to our competitors as we believe inflation will remain front of mind for many of our customers for the remainder of 2022. In recognition of current product cost inflation and our outlook for the rest of the year, we recorded a LIFO charge for the quarter of $93 million compared to $37 million in the prior year. This increase represents a $0.06 headwind to EPS in the quarter versus 2021. Our OG&A rate decreased 46 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items. We were successful in offsetting inflation headwinds in many parts of our business and continued investments in our associate wages by reducing costs in areas that do not impact the customer experience. As an example, this quarter, we introduced a new bakery forecasting tool, which is improving product freshness, reducing waste and, at the same time, simplifying the associate ordering process. We have a strong pipeline of process improvement initiatives and innovative technology-driven solutions that will lower digital fulfillment costs, increase store productivity and reduce waste and shrink. For the fifth consecutive year, we remain on track to deliver $1 billion of cost savings in 2022. The traffic and data generated by our supermarket business continue to create a strong flywheel effect for alternative profits. Led by retail media and Kroger Personal Finance, alternative profits are on track to contribute meaningful growth in 2022. During the quarter, Kroger Precision Marketing added more than 100 new brand partners. We continue to enhance our market-leading capabilities and have entered into new agreements with 3 leading advertising management platforms, allowing our CPG partners to manage their on-site ad campaigns more effectively. Fuel remains an important part of our overall value proposition and a key offering to help customers stretch their dollars, especially when fuel prices are high. We continue to deliver significant value through our loyalty program, which saves customers up to $1.25 per gallon. As Rodney shared earlier, more customers engaged with fuel rewards this quarter, and our gallons grew at a faster rate than the market. The average retail price of fuel was $4 this quarter versus $2.79 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.42 compared to $0.35 in the same quarter last year. Our associates continue to do an outstanding job executing our strategy and serving our customers. we introduced a number of new initiatives to support associates this quarter as well as continuing to invest in hourly wages. These investments are fully contemplated in our guidance and long-term financial model. During the first quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW in Denver, Southern California, Houston, Little Rock, Memphis and Seattle, covering more than 67,000 associates. We continue to negotiate contracts with the UFCW in Las Vegas, Southern California for Ralphs pharmacies, Indianapolis, Roanoke, Chicago and Columbus. Turning now to cash flow and liquidity. Kroger continues to generate strong free cash flow. Our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is 1.68 compared to 1.79 a year ago. The company's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio target range is 2.3 to 2.5. Consistent with our financial strategy, we are investing in the business to drive sustainable future earnings growth and continue to expect capital expenditures of between $3.8 billion and $4 billion in 2022. During quarter 1, we were disciplined in returning cash to shareholders. In total, Kroger returned $819 million via a combination of share repurchases and dividends. We are operating from a position of financial strength and we'll continue to evaluate opportunities to deploy excess cash to accelerate our growth model and deliver sustainable total shareholder returns. In closing, let me share additional color on our outlook for the rest of the year. While there are a number of uncertainties in the macroeconomic and inflation outlook for the remainder of 2022, Kroger is laser-focused on executing the plans outlined at our Investor Day, and we believe our go-to-market strategy will serve us well in navigating the current environment. Based on the strength of our quarter 1 results and sustained food-at-home trends, we are raising our full year guidance. We now expect full year identical sales without fuel of 2.5% to 3.5%, adjusted FIFO operating profit of $4.3 billion to $4.4 billion and adjusted net earnings per diluted share of $3.85 to $3.95, representing an annual growth rate of 5% to 7%. Our updated guidance assumes inflation will remain at tightened levels for the remainder of the year, although we would expect the year-over-year rate to moderate in the second half of the year as we cycle higher inflation from quarter 3 and quarter 4 2021. Due to this higher outlook for inflation, we now expect our LIFO full year charge will be in the range of $300 million compared to $197 million last year. As a reminder, while the actual LIFO charge is calculated at a point in time at the end of our fourth quarter, we recognize the projected charge evenly throughout the year. Our guidance also assumes retail fuel profitability will be a headwind for the remainder of 2022 as we cycle higher CPG margins from 2021. Our full year projected tax rate has been lowered from 23% to 22%, primarily due to higher-than-expected tax deductions related to employee stock option exercises. Overall, we are extremely pleased with our start to the year, which provides another proof point of the strength of our financial model. And looking forward, we remain confident in our ability to deliver sustained earnings growth and total shareholder returns of 8% to 11% over time. And now I'll turn it back to Rodney. W. McMullen: Thanks, Gary. I would like to once again acknowledge and thank our outstanding associates. Their hard work and dedication fuel our Leading With Fresh and Accelerating With Digital strategy and our obsession for our customers. We continue finding new ways to help customers stretch their dollars through everyday prices, data-driven promotions, personalized experiences, trusted Our Brand products and a seamless e-commerce platform. We believe this relentless focus on delivering for customers will help us maintain robust sales and drive growth. Moving ahead, we remain confident that we have the right strategy to deliver value for all stakeholders, including our shareholders. Now we'll turn to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from Robby Ohmes of BofA Global Research. Robert Ohmes : Guys, great quarter. My question is, I was wondering if we could get a little more color on the ID sales. So maybe thoughts on what your -- the traffic component of that, what you're seeing in traffic, the ticket component and maybe specifically the inflation component in the ID sales. And then sort of along with that, some of your competitors that sell groceries and food and beverage are seeing very strong sort of double-digit same-store sales. Is the price spread versus your competitors widening because of the price investments you're making? W. McMullen: Thanks, Robby, and good morning. If you look at -- in terms of traffic, the 2 areas that we felt really good about is if you look at the number of loyal shoppers we have and our household count, both improved. Now a typical basket size for a customer coming in continues to decline. Part of that is just driven because of the economic environment some customers are having. If you look at identicals during the quarter, toward the end of the quarter, they finished a little stronger than where we were during the quarter, and that's continued so far early in the second quarter. Obviously, we're extremely early in the quarter. Obviously, we do have a reasonable-sized general merchandise business that affect it as well. And the comment that I made in the prepared comments, if you look at our fresh departments, they were up over 5%. So overall, we think the customers are doing a lot of work on balancing their total budget, and we continue to balance it as well with promotions. And then customers are aggressively starting to buy our brands and what they're finding is the quality of that product, and there's no compromise with that versus some of the other products. And if you look at our price spreads, we check pricing, obviously, every week. We look at pricing spreads for different types of customers. And those spreads continue to be where they've been or improving slightly has been the case over the last couple of years. I don't know, Gary, anything you want to add? Gary Millerchip : I think you covered it well, Rodney. The only other point you mentioned around total households and loyal households growing, we also saw visits improving during the quarter as well, Robby, which was -- we were really pleased with that trend as well. Operator : Our next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Partners. John Heinbockel : Yes. So let me start with our own brand, right? So it looks like own brand is probably growing 2x the rate of national brand. I'm curious, price spreads there, so maybe, Rodney, talk about that. Where you think own brand momentum goes from here? And I know historically, right, you guys have always said that own brand strength leads to increased CPG promotions. Do you think that will be true this time? W. McMullen: Yes. I love the question, John. And as you know, we're super proud of our brands and super proud of Private Selection, the banner brand and Simple Truth and then Home Chef is our most recent owned brand. The -- that growth has been strong across all components. The only exception of that is Simple Truth was a little soft earlier in the quarter because we did have supply issues with one of the chicken suppliers. But other than that, growth is nice as well. As you know, what we've always found is over time, our brands gain share, and that's been true for over 25 years. And when the economy is tight, our brands always gain share. And then once the economy is good, we may lose a little or maintain, but that's been the case all throughout. Because what customers find is once they try it, they love it. We -- if you look at our leadership team, our -- we've gone and really upgraded our leadership team in terms of our focus on our brands. And for us, it really is -- we look at it the same as a national brand. Our customers do. And as I mentioned, over 90% of our customers include it in their basket. So feel really good. Your second part of your question about the national brand change. I think there's still a lot of capacity constraints among some of the national brands. So I would expect if it's a national brand with capacity, you'll see a typical trend where they get more aggressive in promoting as their tonnage goes down. But if they're supply constrained, I would be surprised. And part of that is just because all of us are exiting COVID at a level of volume higher than what we had going in, which has put different people at different points on supply constraints. John Heinbockel : A quick follow-up to that. Forward buying, right? Normally, a big P&L benefit in inflationary times. It sounds like today, it's limited, right, because of their capacity constraints? W. McMullen: Yes. We do -- the excess warehouse space that we took on as part of COVID, a lot of that space, we've continued to keep. And I would say we're using that space to be able to get product when we can get it. So I think a lot of the CPGs are using it to level out production. So when they have excess production, we're taking that. And it, in essence, becomes forward buy, but I don't think it will be as big as it's been in past situations. Operator : Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : I'll ask my question and follow-up, one shot here. First, Rodney, I want to ask about the competitive environment. It feels like it's pretty rational out there, and it seems like the consumer has been price taking for the last, call it, number of months. And even Walmart mentioned 1.5 weeks ago they're not getting in too aggressive on price. I want to ask you, now that the consumer basket or consumer behavior is starting to change, might this environment change? Do we think -- do you think we're at a new normal in terms of promotional activity? Or do you think this is -- yes, I don't want to put it like a house of cards, but it feels like everyone's kind of playing nice and something can break. W. McMullen: Yes. Well, it's a good question. And obviously, we always spend a lot of time focused on it. Your first comment, we are seeing the competitive environment pretty similar to what it's been. As you know, our go-to-market strategy really is Leading With Fresh. And what we find is it's the most important reason why somebody decides where to shop. And our teams are really working hard to take our fresh experience to the next level, and our customers are telling us they appreciate what they're doing and they're seeing that improvement. So when you look at it, we think price is just one component. We're going to make sure that we always maintain a reasonable spread in the things that we're good at with our rewards program, our fuel rewards and our fresh go-to-market strategy. Those things matter, and that's where we're going to win in the marketplace. And we expect that to continue to be important in every imaginable environment going forward. So to me, it's one of those things where it's important, we continually check. But we always think it's important to remember it's the total customer experience that we're focused on rather than price alone. Operator : Our next question comes from Spencer Hanus of Wolfe Research. Spencer Hanus : Can you provide some more color on the FIFO adjusted gross margins in the quarter? Because it looks like that slowed sequentially. And then you said your price gaps are well positioned, but do you think you're going to need to invest further in price in the second half as we just see sort of inflation pick up and that consumer gets under more pressure? Gary Millerchip : Yes, thanks for the question. Yes, I'll cover that, and Rodney can add any additional color he'd like to. Generally, our gross margin rate was in line with our expectations for the quarter. As you heard us share, we had 2 major investments during the quarter, which was investing in value for the customer and also the supply chain headwinds that we -- as Rodney mentioned in his prepared comments, we fully expected during the year. Overall, we feel like we were right in line with what we expect it to be. I know we called out in our comments around the PPE inventory write-off, that really wasn't material enough to sort of be something that I think investors should be thinking about is going to be a factor in our expectations for the rest of the year. I think we shared in our original guidance for the year that we believe gross margin would be a headwind during the year as we made the investments in price and supply chain. The first quarter played out largely as we expected. We don't call out all the puts and takes in the quarter. And things like COVID vaccines would have been a tailwind last year, that wouldn't have been a tailwind this year. So I think there's a lot of extra moving parts in there. And what we try and do is call out the pieces that we've communicated previously so we're consistent and also give you a flavor for the major moving parts. But overall, we felt the quarter was very much in line with strategy, and we wouldn't be pointing to a change in that for the rest of the year. I'll maybe just add one piece of additional color because I know it's kind of something I've seen as a sort of question floating around before the call started was, certainly, the gross margin outlook hasn't changed. That's not a factor in how we think our guidance looks for the rest of the year. We're very confident with how we think about the outlook for the rest of the year. I think that some of the factors to bear in mind when you think about the second half, I mentioned it in my prepared comments, but LIFO for the year is going to be about $150 million higher than budget and about $100 million higher than prior year spread across the 4 quarters. We do expect fuel margins will be a headwind for the rest of the year and directionally think of that as maybe a $50 million or so headwind as well. So I think about it more of the underlying trends that we shared during the quarter is something that we feel is right on track with our plan. But there are some unique factors that will influence the second half of the year. And from our perspective, those are generally going to be things that you won't have to cycle in 2023, but there are obviously headwinds in the rest of this year in terms of our overall financial outlook. W. McMullen: The other thing I think it's always important to remember is we always look at gross margin in light of our OG&A cost as well. And obviously, our teams did an incredible job of managing OG&A costs. And we always will invest some of those OG&A savings in trying to extend the customer's budget, especially in an environment like this where it's important. And I think some of those reasons are the reasons why our customer counts have improved as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Karen Short of Barclays. Karen Short : I have a couple of questions. I just -- and they can all kind of tie into one. But the first is on your actual volume versus your comp. So as you look at your guidance, we know where CPI is and we know what your implied 2Q to 4Q guidance is. So it certainly implies demand destruction from a volume and tonnage perspective. So wondering if you could talk about that. And then specifically on your full guide, obviously, we came back into the FIFO guide for operating profit for 2Q to 4Q. It looks like you'll be down about 6% on that operating profit number versus where you were at this quarter which is up around 16%. So wondering if you could triangulate those 2. Gary Millerchip : Sure. Thanks, Karen. Yes, I think the first part of the question would be, as I mentioned it a moment ago, around we look at the guidance for the rest of the year. Our overall outlook for inflation is that we do expect inflation is going to be higher for the rest of the year than we originally expected when we sort of entered 2022 and provided our original guidance. Having said that, it's important, I think, to remember that we don't have a perfect crystal ball, of course, like all of us are trying to figure out there are multiple scenarios that could play out. I think our central scenario though is that we think inflation will remain higher. But as we cycle about a 4% increase in inflation in the second half of last year compared to the first half of last year, absolute annual inflation, we may well actually start to see a more moderated number in the second half of the year. So we're currently assuming inflation in the second half as a headline rate maybe a couple of percentage points or so lower than the first half of the year. So we're actually -- if you think about our sales guidance, we are assuming that we see some momentum in our units because of the way we're thinking about inflation. Now of course, that outcome could be different and that will impact the outcome of the results that we report, but our overall assumption is based on that kind of high-level view, which we think takes into account all the different data points that we've been able to look at both internally and externally. And then from an operating profit perspective, as I mentioned a few moments ago, from really the way we think about the rest of the year, our overall EPS guidance, if you kind of look at the midpoint of our new range for the rest of the year, it would be flat to slightly down. I think the really key messages in that would be think about the, as I mentioned a moment ago, the LIFO charge will be having a major impact on that, both versus budget and versus prior year. And as I mentioned, whereas fuel would have been a tailwind in the first quarter, it will actually be a headwind for the rest of the year. So we think of the sort of supermarket business as being robust and relatively on track in terms of what we would have expected and continuing to build momentum. It's really around those other factors that are driving the lack of sort of carryforward of the momentum on year-over-year growth in the first quarter when you look at that relative to the rest of the year. Karen Short : As well as the vaccine headwind, correct? Gary Millerchip : Vaccine headwind would have been in the first quarter probably a factor, and then it would also be a factor in Q2 and Q3. But again, I wouldn't think of that as being a major headwind on what -- so that was probably a bigger factor in Q1 as any quarter. So I wouldn't think of the gross margin performance that we saw in the first quarter of the year as being dramatically different expectation in the remaining quarters based on the impact of vaccine and other factors. Operator : Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer & Co. Rupesh Parikh : So I just want to go back to grocery market share. Just want to get a sense of how your markets are held up in the grocery category. And I guess related to that, it sounds like the general merchandise category had some headwinds. So just wondering if that contributed maybe to the weaker ID performance. W. McMullen: If you look at grocery market share for the -- overall, it's pretty much close to where we thought it would be. We would expect continued improvement throughout the year, which was reflected in the original guidance. Your comment on general merchandise is correct. Our general -- if you look at our identicals in total, without general merchandise, it would be pretty similar to where the fresh IDs were. And the general merchandise, obviously, households are starting to change their behavior on shopping and it shows up there. And obviously, some of the savings and things that customers had from not being able to spend money on service as well is showing up there. So we are making progress on market share overall and would expect to continue to make marked improvements as we go along in the year. Rupesh Parikh : Great. And then maybe just one quick housekeeping question. I know last quarter, you gave quarterly cadence guidance. Is that still intact on the comp and EPS line? Or I don't know if there's any updated views there. Gary Millerchip : Sure. Yes. Just briefly, I would say, on the EPS side of things, I mentioned a moment ago, Rupesh, that I think if you look at the guidance for the back -- the last 3 quarters of the year, it would sort of predominantly be around the sort of flat to slightly down. I would think of that, if you look at the cadence last year, it would be relatively consistent if you think about the next 3 quarters. So I wouldn't call out any dramatic year-over-year variance to that overall. And then I think on a sales perspective, as we mentioned, we would expect the first half to be a little bit better than the second half in terms of sales. That's predicated on this belief though that inflation continues at heightened levels. But on a year-over-year basis, the back half would be potentially a few basis points lower because we're cycling 4% higher inflation in the second half of last year than the first half of last year. Operator : Our next question comes from Edward Kelly of Wells Fargo. Edward Kelly : I wanted to go back to the question on -- I want to go back to the question just on tonnage and underlying unit volume. Rodney, I think when we were sort of all looking at this quarter, I think we would all, on the investor side, agree that we probably thought your ID would be better given the trends that we saw in inflation. And I'm kind of curious as to what you are seeing in underlying tonnage. And then you talked about, I think I heard you right when you said that basket is down despite that backdrop. So I'm just kind of curious as to what you're seeing on like that side. And do you think any -- are you seeing anything that is being caused by changes in consumer behavior, right, whether that's sort of like channel shifting, seeking value, that type of stuff? W. McMullen: Yes. If you look on the basket size, that's driven by units per basket. And what we're finding is customers are coming in more frequently before but they're not buying as many items on each shop. And that's what we're seeing. We're also seeing customers, especially customers that aren't as sensitive to their budget, upscaling with or buying bigger packs, especially earlier in the month when -- depending on when people were getting money. So we continue to see both of those dynamics. If you look at the fresh departments, the trends there would be better than the overall. The -- if you look at overall units, we -- for most of the CPG partners, we would be tracking pretty similar to where their unit changes are overall in the marketplace in -- if you look at our top 25. I don't know, Gary, anything you want to add to that? And I know you're pulling up some... Gary Millerchip : Yes. Well, I think just to clarify maybe the comment we made, the total basket size is actually up. It's the number of units in the basket that are down. So if we look at our overall metrics, households are up, loyal households are up, visits have turned positive, basket size is up. But the number of items in the basket, as Rodney mentioned, is the item that I think customers are adapting behavior as they start to manage the inflationary environment. And that's obviously a focus area for us to use data personalization and different tools around rewards to really aim to continue to drive that up. And as I mentioned, if you look at our second half guidance as we expect in our current assumption, inflation would be, on a year-over-year basis, maybe not as quite as high even though remaining at sustained levels, then our guidance reflects the expectation that we continue to make progress on that front. Edward Kelly : Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. I think that you said that you sort of expected the gross margin trend for the rest of the year to be similar to Q1. Did you mean the year-over-year decline? Or did you mean multiyear? Just kind of curious as to what you were talking about there. Gary Millerchip : Yes. I wouldn't want to get into specific guidance because of the comment that Rodney mentioned around we do try and manage the business dynamically. I think what I was really saying, Ed, was it was specific to the current year. I'm really saying that when you think about Q1, I think there was some concern that the PPE write-down was somehow need to be reversed out and that would be the trend that we're seeing in terms of gross margin rate. So I think the guidance that we shared at the beginning of the year was we expected gross margin to be a headwind. We didn't expect the volatility to be as significant as we've seen in the past. And as I mentioned, the PPE is really one of a number of puts and takes. But because we called it out last year in the first quarter, we didn't want to not clearly mention it again in the current quarter, but I wouldn't see it as a major factor. And so it was related to Q1 was the -- that's the kind of directional shape of gross margin, which is, I think, consistent with what we shared when we gave our guidance for the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Montani from Evercore. Michael Montani : Just wanted to ask, first off, looking at food-at-home inflation, it looks like it was up just about double digits for your quarter calendarized. And if we adjusted that, given your gen merch mix a little bit, maybe it's a point or 2 below. But just wanted to see, is that kind of the right way to think about what you might have been able to pass through to the consumer given that PPI is so much ahead of those levels? W. McMullen: Yes. I always think it's important to look at CPI and PPI together. And it's also the reason why we shared a little bit more details about Our Brands than normal because you have -- customers are doing their own behavior in terms of changing the way they shop. So if you think about, in some cases, a national brand item may cost $3 and Our Brand might be $1 or $2. So that would show up and would cause our inflation rate not to be as high as what's in the marketplace. I also think it's important to remind people that on -- when you look at Our Brands overall, our gross margin's about 600 basis points better than the national brand. And if you look at profit per item, it's similar or, in many cases, actually higher. So to me, I would look at those numbers as general directional things but not specifics to be able to compare directly just because customers' behavior is changing.  And if you look at like in pork, as an example, customers aggressively moved to pork during the quarter. And some of that movement was at the expense of people not buying as much beef because it's a great value for the money, as an example. So you have -- within all the data, you have a lot of customer behavior changes. But I think it's helpful directionally, but not exactly. Michael Montani : Okay. And then for a follow-up, if I could, was just around the $1 billion plus of gross cost savings. I was just wondering if that would be kind of metered out evenly throughout the course of the year and how it might compare to kind of inflationary pressures you might be seeing in wages and/or transportation with diesel at record highs. Gary Millerchip : Yes. The $1 billion of savings would certainly be sort of an ongoing flow of initiatives. So certainly think about it as being consistently sort of building from -- so we've got a certain number of benefits from last year that flow through, and then we're introducing new initiatives this year. So because we're on this 5-year journey, $1 billion of savings, it's very much a continual flow of new initiatives that are being implemented in the business to drive those efficiencies and savings. So I'd certainly think of it in general terms as being fairly consistently throughout the year. Now of course, there are a number of puts and takes in lines and we continue to invest in average hourly rates. I think we mentioned in the first quarter, there was a benefit from lower pension contributions during the first quarter. So I wouldn't think of the OG&A rate improvement that we saw in Q1 as being typical for the year. But we do expect to continue to see OG&A rate in the year being an improvement and a tailwind for the year. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS. Michael Lasser : In light of the perception that your food categories were up, call it, 5% in the quarter and Nielsen was up 6%, the mass merchants were comping and improving leverage up high single, double digits. There's a perception out there, Rodney, that Kroger lost market share during the period. Why would that have been the case? And you made a comment that you expect your market share trends to improve in the next couple of quarters. What do you expect will drive that improvement? W. McMullen: If you look, all of us, our quarters end at a little different time. So it's always difficult to be exactly comparison. And I know some of the competitors don't break out specific by category. And I know for us, obviously, general merchandise is a bigger part of our business than some of our traditional competitors, not as much as some of the big-box competitors. If you look at during the quarter, our trends improved as we went along during the quarter. As Gary mentioned, our household count went up, increased. Our loyal household count went up. And our visits in total also increased. And our trends improved as well. So those are the things that give us confidence in terms of the things that we're doing and the direction we're headed is continuing to move in the right direction. Gary Millerchip : Yes. The only other thing maybe I would add, Rodney, is that the comments we made, Michael, about digital growth and the expectation that with the investments we're making in customer fulfillment centers, the announcement -- the exciting announcement that Rodney shared this morning around Boost membership launching across the whole of the company, we feel that the momentum that we're seeing starting to build in digital will also be an important component of that growth in the future as well. Michael Lasser : And if I could add a quick clarifying question on that. The perception is also that over the next couple of quarters, economic pressure across a broader swath of consumers, not just those at the lowest income demographic, that pressure is going to increase. And that might push people to shop more at the dollar stores, might push them to shop more at the warehouse clubs, where the perception is that they may be able to stretch their budget a little further. So in response to that, what is Kroger going to need to do, invest more in price, change pack sizes and other actions that could impact its profitability to prevent customers from going elsewhere? Gary Millerchip : Thanks, Michael. Yes, I think briefly, we see that as an opportunity actually for Kroger because what we tend to see in those more economically challenged times is that the customer that's less stressed, as you described them, actually views Kroger as a high-quality place to get more value compared to maybe shopping a larger number of stores, and we even see it with some of our own brand performance. Rodney mentioned the strong value and ingredients for cooking at home, but we also saw strength during the quarter in Private Selection and Meal Solutions. So we see that as an opportunity for us to really connect with that customer as they start to maybe determine the best place to shop for quality and value combined. Operator : Our next question comes from Kate McShane of Goldman Sachs. Katharine McShane : I wondered if you could talk a little bit about how conversations are going with your vendor partners currently, especially in light of the ongoing inflation to the second half. Have you been able to push back with regards to some of the cost inflation? And will you be getting more aggressive in those conversations like some of your competitors have suggested? W. McMullen: It's an ongoing dialogue. And obviously, overall, we try to make sure that we have a partnership relationship. It's also one of the values in having Our Brands so it's such a strong component. So we understand true cost increases versus somebody just wanting to raise margins. In many cases, with the CPG partners, we're identifying areas where we can work together to take costs out so that we can reduce it. And like on backhauls is an area that we're making great progress on by using technology, both of our technologies and databases, to understand how to change. I would say that we're going to always push back on any type of cost increase that's not justified. And we're going to also try to work together to figure out a way to reduce our combined costs whenever we can. I think it's a difficult answer to say how are we doing versus competition or competitors. I'm super proud of our procurement team. As Gary mentioned earlier, one of the big component on the cost saves is renegotiating both things not for resell and resell [ both ]. So we feel good about where we are, but it's an ongoing dialogue. And obviously, it's a little more difficult dialogue when you have such high inflation. Katharine McShane : And if I could just ask an unrelated follow-up. Just with regards to the Boost rollout, are there any more details with regards to the timing of that? And I know there was higher retention and other metrics you cited, but was there also a comp lift impact from Boost during the quarter in those 3 test regions? W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at the test regions, it would positively affect our identicals. And the thing that's most important to us is it causes that customer to be stickier to our overall ecosystem, not just on delivery. So -- and our strategy is that if a customer thinks food, we want them to think Kroger. So we feel good about where we are and it's continued in the right direction. Operator : Our final question for today comes from Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research. Charles Cerankosky : Rodney, if you talk about your e-commerce sales, they were down 6% overall. Can you shed some light on the components of that because I don't think it reflects what's going on with the new CFCs and spokes. So where is the negative numbers coming from? And how are the -- how is the Ocado-based facilities performing? W. McMullen: Yes. Thanks, Chuck. If you look at -- pickup would be the area where we would have the biggest decline. And what -- as I mentioned, what we're finding is that customer, as they get comfortable, they move back into stores. And the retention rate is better than the overall retention rate. If you look at the sheds, the NPS scores continue to be outstanding. The retention rate and repeat purchase rate on the sheds is very strong. And they're continuing to move in the right direction. And if you look toward the end of the quarter in the recent few weeks, our performance on year-on-year for online has actually turned to positive. So the first quarter was pretty similar to where we thought it would be because we were cycling some strong numbers early in the quarter, and the trend has moved back into the positive neighborhood. So thanks, Chuck. Charles Cerankosky : And then on the increase in working capital dollars spent during the quarter, does a lot of that simply reflect inflation? Or are you -- is Kroger, in fact, getting more aggressive on forward buying or just trying to grab stuff when it's available? Gary Millerchip : Chuck, yes, I think there's a couple of different factors just briefly in there. Overall, we've been on a plan for a number of years to continue to optimize working capital. So I wouldn't say it's a dramatic change in strategy. We're very focused on continuing to drive improvements there and have seen good tailwinds in our cash flow because of that. This quarter, we would have seen an increase in inventory. Part of that would be to do with sort of starting to get back towards pre-COVID levels as the in-stock and supply chain improves. Nothing that would be concerning to us from a sell-through perspective, but we do think it's important to make sure we continue to improve the supply chain. And of course, inflation would have also impacted that number as well, but nothing out of the ordinary. W. McMullen: Thank you for -- to everyone for joining us today. I am incredibly proud of the way we are beginning in 2022, with a continued focus on our Leading With Fresh and Accelerating With Digital strategy. As always, I'd like to share a few comments with our associates listening in. First, obviously, thank you. The past several years have been challenging and weighed on all of us differently. While each of us react in a unique way, no one should have to struggle alone. That's why we offer a variety of resources, from in-person and virtual counseling sessions through our well-being assistant, to tools to help leaders of others foster a supportive environment. I would encourage each of us to take time to ensure we have the support systems we need in place. And if we don't, please ask for help. We are all our best advocates and know what truly we need. Thank you for everything you do for each other. Thank you for what you do for our customers every day. And thank you for what you do for our communities every day. I'm inspired every single day of the week by your amazing work that you do. Thanks again for joining us today, and that concludes our first quarter earnings call. Operator : Thank you for joining today's call. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference call over to Rob Quast, Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Rob Quast : Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's second quarter 2022 earnings call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Company assumes no obligation to update that information. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Rodney. W. McMullen: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. The Kroger team delivered another strong performance during the quarter, fueled by our strategy Leading With Fresh and Accelerating With Digital. These consistent results underscore the resiliency and flexibility of our business model, along with our associates' passion to deliver a fresh, convenient customer experience with 0 compromise on quality, selection and affordability. Customers continue to adjust their shopping habits in response to ongoing inflation. We are doing everything we can to help our customers stretch their dollars with high-quality fresh products at everyday low prices and industry-leading fuel rewards program and personalized savings on the items that matter most to them. Our customers are looking for ways to save and we are there for them. During the quarter, digital coupon engagement hit an all-time high with 750 million digital offers downloaded, totaling almost $1 billion in savings. Our fuel rewards program continues to resonate with customers as more than 600,000 incremental households engaged with our fuel rewards program this quarter compared to last year. And our fuel reward redemption rates were also up significantly. We continue to see more customers cooking from scratch and eating out less often. Our broad assortment of products is meeting the need for customers to buy what they want on their terms. For example, some customers are continuing to buy more of their favorite fresh products like apples, tomatoes and grapes. While other customers are choosing products like frozen fruit and vegetables, allowing products to last longer in their homes. Overall, customers are looking to save money and make healthier choices by cooking more meals at home rather than eating out. Kroger's strong value proposition drove positive household growth and meaningful [indiscernible] household growth both online and in-store. Digital sales also returned to positive growth, driven by our one-of-a-kind boost membership program and expansion of our Kroger delivery network. It's clear our go-to-market strategy is connecting with customers, and we continue to build long-term customer loyalty through Fresh, Our Brands, Personalization and our Seamless ecosystem. Leading with Fresh, we are dedicated to serving our customers the freshest products so when they think food, they think Kroger. To achieve this goal, we are utilizing technology and deploying fresh innovation to deliver products faster, which stay fresher longer for our customers to enjoy. And it's working. In our 864 fresh certified stores, customers are purchasing more fresh products and overall store sales are growing faster than the rest of the business. Supply chain remains an important part of our fresh strategy as well. In order to maximize freshness, we are utilizing our data science and collaborating with our partners to minimize [ dwell ] time in our distribution network and maintain the integrity of the cold chain. We are also improving productivity in our supply chain. During the quarter, we reduced fuel cost headwinds through technology and process efficiencies, such as controlling more product movement across the value chain and maximizing our trucking capacity. While some categories remain challenging, supplier in-stocks are improving, and we are cautiously optimistic this will continue in the back half of the year. Turning to Our Brands. We saw incredible engagement in Our Brands during the quarter with identical sales growth of 10.2% compared to last year. This increase was led by our Kroger and Home Chef brands. Convenience remains a priority and Home Chef is meeting that need by providing high-quality family meals as a budget-friendly alternative to eating out at restaurants. For other customers who are enjoying cooking from scratch, Our Brands are delivering innovative products at a great value. So Our Brands' product strategy is rooted in quality, providing customers with memorable meal experiences they crave. And these products continue to earn world-class recognition. Most recently, Murray's Cheese varieties won five awards at the highly regarded 2022 American Cheese Society Competition. We were also recognized by Store Brands Magazine with 12 Editors' Picks awards for best new products, the most of any retailer. This recognition focused specifically on food that met customer needs for healthier products. As we continue to look for ways to help our customers stretch their budgets, this quarter, we launched a new portfolio strategy for our opening price point brands. We consolidated 17 legacy brands into 2. Heritage Farm for our fresh and dairy product lines; and our newest brand, Smart Way for our nonperishable items. These brands are competitively priced and meet the needs of customers on a [indiscernible] budget. We launched with 150 SKUs and expect to roll out additional products by the end of the year. Now moving to digital. We achieved positive sales growth, as I mentioned before, led by our strong delivery results. Early in the second quarter, we introduced our Boost membership nationwide, and it's already showing promising results including an increase in overall household spend among members. We remain focused on adding new members and are encouraged that enrollment is in line with our internal expectations and projections. During the quarter, we opened a new Customer Fulfillment Center powered by Ocado's automated Smart Platform in Romulus, Michigan. Additionally, we are excited to expand the Kroger delivery network to more customers in four new geographies during the quarter through spoke facilities in Austin, Birmingham, Oklahoma City and San Antonio. This brings our total CFC and spoke count to 18. We also continue to invest in our pickup business, where demand remains strong. During the quarter, we increased capacity and shortened wait times to improve our customer experience. We also invested in technology and implemented process efficiencies, which helped lower our cost to serve. Our customers are telling us they love our Seamless experience. We continue to see customers effortlessly shift between store, pickup and delivery, which is building loyalty. We continue to improve the experience. And we'll always encourage our customers to shop with us how they want to and with 0 compromises. Our associate dedication and passion continue to fuel Kroger's consistently strong results, and we are proud to invest in our teams and improve the associate experience. We saw more people apply to work at Kroger this quarter as we continue to attract talented associates. Our current associates, we are making progress on retention. We've rolled out improved onboarding guidelines and implemented career planning tools. In addition, as part of our commitment to associate wellness, we recently introduced a new financial coaching service tool for hourly associates. This unique benefit offers free financial planning assistance to our associates. We are launching the tool in three pilot divisions and look forward to expanding the service across the company by January of 2023. It is always exciting to see our associates' commitment to creating an outstanding work environment recognized. For the third consecutive year, Kroger was named a Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion, earning a perfect score on the 2022 Disability Equity Index. Additionally, the Brandon Hall Group, a leading human capital management firm, honored Kroger for our training programs and the ways in which our teams promote diversity, equity and inclusion. Each team member is involved in creating our culture where associates come for a job and discover a career. Our Purpose : to Feed the Human Spirit inspires our team every day. One important way we bring our purpose to life is through Kroger's comprehensive ESG strategy. Our aim is to achieve lasting positive change for people and our planet. Our newly published 2022 ESG report called Nurturing Shared Values, outlines the entire Kroger family strong progress against dozens of environmental sustainability, social impact and governance goals and commitments. We continued working to operationalize and integrate ESG within our business. Nowhere is this more evident than through our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social impact plan. This month marks the fifth anniversary of the launch of Zero Hunger | Zero Waste. And while we still have much -- so much more work to do to achieve our moonshot goal of achieving a world free from hunger and food waste, we also have so much to celebrate. Over the past 5 years, our team donated 2.3 billion meals to our neighbors in need, which included $1 billion in giving to fight food and security, 500 million pounds of surplus food donated to our food bank partners and nearly $45 million in grants to support food recovery and system change from our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste Foundation. And I'm very proud to share for the first time ever, our store teams achieved 100% execution of Zero Hunger | Zero Waste food rescue, which is the strongest proof point yet of the value of operationalizing ESG. It took all of our teams working cross-functionally to achieve this important milestone. A huge congratulations and thank you to all involved. In summary, Kroger delivered another strong second quarter. We continue to delight our customers, strengthen our business model and execute on our strategy of Leading With Fresh and Accelerating With Digital. We remain focused on delivering for our associates, customers and communities. And when we do that well, deliver value for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn it over to Gary to take you through our second quarter financials. Gary? Gary Millerchip : Thank you, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. The Kroger team is laser-focused on executing our go-to-market strategy, which we outlined at our Investor Day in March. Our balanced business model has proven to be resilient in a variety of operating and economic environments, and our second quarter performance provided another proof point of this as we delivered significant year-over-year growth.  I'll now provide additional color on our second quarter results. We achieved strong identical sales growth without fuel of 5.8% and saw momentum build throughout the quarter. Our Brands led the way with identical sales growing 10.2%. We believe the unmatched combination of innovation, quality and value provided by Our Brands is a clear competitive advantage as inflation remains front of mind for many of our customers. Adjusted EPS was $0.90 for the quarter, an increase of 13% compared to the same quarter last year and ahead of our internal expectations. These results were driven by increased sales of our fuel, disciplined margin management and strong fuel profitability. Our seamless digital ecosystem is critical to building deeper customer loyalty and accelerating market share growth. During the quarter, digital sales grew 8%, led by strength in delivery solutions, which grew by 34%. We continue to invest in digital growth initiatives, including the expansion of our Kroger Delivery network in new and existing geographies, investments in the customer value proposition via Kroger Boost membership and the expansion of customer trip missions, including meal solutions and Kroger Delivery Now. As a result of these initiatives, we expect our positive momentum in digital sales will continue in the second half of the year. Kroger Health also contributed meaningfully to our second quarter results as we grew the profitability of our core pharmacy business. This allowed us to cycle the impact of higher COVID-19 vaccine revenue from a year ago, which is especially impressive given the number of [ vaccinations ] administered last year. Gross margin was 20.9% of sales for the quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased 2 basis points compared to the same period last year. This result reflected our ability to effectively manage product cost inflation through strong sourcing practices while helping customers manage their budgets and keeping prices competitive. Our team is doing an outstanding job navigating the current inflationary environment. We are experiencing the benefits of a multiyear journey in enterprise sourcing that is delivering significant and sustainable savings for Kroger and our customers. Our personalized pricing strategy is enabling us to maximize the reach and effectiveness of our promotional investments to drive loyalty and deliver value for our customers in ways they value most. Together, this has enabled Kroger to improve our price position relative to our key competitors. Due to continued heightened levels of product cost inflation, we recorded a LIFO charge for the quarter of $148 million compared to $47 million in the prior year. We expect inflation will remain at heightened levels in the second half of the year but moderate on a year-over-year basis as we start to cycle the higher inflation, which began in the third quarter last year. Kroger's OG&A rate increased 36 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items compared to the same period last year. This increase was driven by investments in associates, higher incentive plan costs and strategic investments in various margin expansion initiatives, partly offset by sales leverage and continued execution of cost savings. We continue to identify opportunities to remove costs from our business without affecting the customer experience and they're on track to deliver our fifth consecutive year of $1 billion in cost savings. As I mentioned a moment ago, the increase in our OG&A rate during the quarter was unusual as it included an accrual catch-up for higher projected incentive costs covering the first half of the year, as well as strategic investments in a number of margin expansion initiatives that will drive future growth. We would expect to achieve year-over-year improvements in our OG&A rate in the second half of the year and for the full year. Turning now to alternative profits. Kroger Precision Marketing continues to increase its relevance with our CPG partners. During the quarter, we saw an increase in brand reinvestment rates as CPGs experienced strong returns on their marketing spend with KPM. Kroger Personal Finance products and services are also connecting well with customers in the current environment, providing even more ways to save. This includes our KPF credit card featuring an introductory $0.55 off per gallon of fuel and our gift card program, which promotionally offers 4x fuel rewards. Fuel remains an important part of our business model and delivered exceptional performance in the second quarter. As Rodney mentioned earlier, our fuel rewards program is a key differentiator to help customers stretch their dollars, especially when fuel prices are high. Customers engage with our fuel rewards program at the highest rate since the start of the pandemic during the second quarter, and this helped to ensure our gallon sales outpace the market. The average retail fuel price was $4.62 this quarter compared to $3.13 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.62 compared to $0.39 in the same quarter in 2021. The strength of our fuel results is a great example of the flexibility that exists within our business model as higher fuel profit fully offset the higher LIFO charge in the quarter and allowed us to reinvest strategically in a number of margin expansion initiatives. Our associates continue to do an outstanding job executing our strategy and serving our customers, and we are investing in hourly wages to ensure Kroger remains an employee of choice. We're also committed to continuing to invest in our associates and sustainably growing hourly wages. These investments are fully contemplated in our long-term financial model. During the second quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for associates in Houston, Memphis, Lake Charles, Shreveport, Las Vegas Clarkson and Meat, Southern California [ Clarkson Meats ] and Indianapolis, covering more than 40,000 associates. In the second half, we plan to complete contract negotiations for Chicago, Columbus, Fort Wayne, Toledo, South Bend and Southern California pharmacists. Turning now to our financial strategy and liquidity. Kroger continues to generate strong free cash flow. As a result of our operating performance and working capital improvements over recent years, our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio is now 1.63 compared to our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Underlying initiatives to improve working capital also helped offset higher inventory balances during the quarter, which were a function of higher product cost inflation and in-stocks returning to pre-pandemic levels. We continue to prioritize capital investments that support our go-to-market strategy and see many opportunities to drive future growth. As we updated in our guidance today, we now expect our range for capital investments for 2022 to be between $3.4 billion and $3.6 billion as various initiatives have been delayed due to supply constraints. Earlier this quarter, we raised our quarterly dividend by 24%, reflecting our confidence in our long-range plans and our ability to continue to generate strong free cash flow. The quarterly dividend has grown at a 14% compounded annual growth rate since being reinstated in 2006. And this marks the 16th consecutive year of dividend increases. During the quarter, we also repurchased $309 million of shares and year-to-date, have repurchased $975 million of shares. Earlier today, our Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program. I'd now like to share additional color on our outlook for the remainder of the year. The Kroger team's consistent execution in our go-to-market strategy is building momentum in our business, which combined with sustained food-at-home trends gives us the confidence to again raise our full year guidance. We now expect full year identical sales without fuel of 4% to 4.5%, adjusted FIFO operating profit of $4.6 billion to $4.7 billion and adjusted net earnings per diluted share of $3.95 to $4.05, representing growth of 7% to 10% over 2021. This outlook includes a year-over-year headwind from LIFO of approximately $100 million in the second half of 2022. In closing, we have the right go-to-market strategy and are operating from a position of strength. Looking forward, we remain confident in our ability to deliver attractive and sustainable total shareholder returns of 8% to 11% over time. And now I'll turn it back to Rodney. W. McMullen: Thanks, Gary. The Kroger team successfully navigated another quarter in a dynamic operating environment with strong results. As our customers continue to deal with high inflation, our value proposition is resonating with them. And this reflects the balance we've built into our model. We have demonstrated the ability to offer customers fresh, affordable food and the value they need to help them manage their budgets while we continue to invest in our associates, reinvest in our business and consistently generate strong results. Our performance gives us the confidence that we have the right plan in place to build on our momentum and continue delivering value for all stakeholders. So with that, Alex, we'll turn it over for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim. John Heinbockel : I want to start a little quick with the improvement you saw in IDs, can you break that out into traffic and ticket? And then maybe within ticket, right, AUR versus items per basket? And is -- I know nonfood has been a big drag. Is that still a drag? Did that get better at all? W. McMullen: I'll start on that and let Gary add some more of the details. The biggest part of the drive in improving trends is continued improvement in our loyal household growth and total household of people coming to our stores. We continue to see average transaction size smaller as people come into the store more often and more frequent. We would continue with some headwinds from the nonfood products as well. Gary, any additional insights you want to provide? Gary Millerchip : I think you covered most of it, Rodney. As Rodney mentioned, John, we're certainly seeing for our most low shoppers continuing to win that first basket, and we're definitely seeing, as we look at our trends, that's holding up very well compared to what we're seeing overall within the market. And for our most loyal customers, as Rodney mentioned, we're seeing that number grow overall and trips also growing with our customer that most loyal shoppers starting to increase the number of trips into the store as well. So I think they are the key points that I would call out. W. McMullen: Yes. The only other thing that might be helpful insight, John, is it's pretty consistent across the country as well. John Heinbockel : Real quick follow-up then, right? Your nonfuel gross is the best we've seen, or one of the best we've seen in a while despite the inflation. So maybe is that mix -- role of mix versus -- I'm curious if there's a lot of forward bought product that you're benefiting from? Or is that still hard to get? W. McMullen: Yes. If you look, one of the things that our teams have done a nice job is on procurement. The other piece would be, as you mentioned, mix. The fresh departments continue to help on mix. And we continue to see a lot of customers continue to add value-added products as well. I don't know Gary, any additional comments? Gary Millerchip : Yes, I think you picked up the biggest drivers with sourcing and the benefits. It's not so much forward buying but continuing to be really disciplined, John, with how we look at the designer product and how we're managing relationships with our supply partners as well. One of the areas I would say, specifically in that, that was a tailwind this quarter versus last quarter is the sourcing team and supply chains working really well together to offset the pressure on fuel costs and making sure that we're improving efficiency in the supply chain and operating at optimum levels to really offset that. And naturally, whereas in the last couple of quarters, supply chain would have been a headwind to gross margin, it was essentially flat this quarter. And that wasn't because fuel costs were not a headwind year-over-year. It was really how we applied our approach to the challenge across sourcing the supply chain to make our operation more efficient. Operator : Our next question comes from Kelly Bania from BMO. Kelly Bania : Just wanted -- if you could help us understand how fuel is impacting that. I think your prior plan was for a $50 million headwind. I think you just talked about LIFO, which sounds like is going to be about $150 million higher for the year. Just trying to think about those puts and takes as it relates to kind of the core flow-through of the higher [ IEs ] and how that impacts the back half? W. McMullen: Gary, go ahead. Gary Millerchip : Yes, absolutely. Kelly, thanks for the question. Yes, I think you've actually picked on many of the key points. We would be expecting many of the levers that we've been pulling in managing to grow sales and grow customer loyalty and manage the margin performance in the business will be consistent in the back half of the year. The key elements that we called out are what would optically make our EPS growth look less meaningful in the second half. First of all, as you mentioned, our total LIFO charge for the year is about a $250 million headwind for the whole year, which translates to about $100 million, so about $0.10 of EPS impact in the back half of the year. On fuel, we haven't changed our view. [ Fuel's ] been very difficult to predict, and we don't want to kind of rely on potential upside in fuel when it really isn't something that we -- while the team does a great job of managing the best in the conditions, we don't lead, obviously, on fuel pricing. Our reward program, which really what drives our strategy in fuel. So we're assuming, as we cycle $0.43 to $0.44 of CPG profit from the back half of last year, but if fuel rates more sort of return to normalized levels, then that would be a $50 million to $60 million headwind in the back half of the year. So there's about $0.16 of EPS headwinds that we have built in today for LIFO. Were it not for those two, then essentially our EPS would be sort of in the 6% to 8% growth range very much in line with our TSR. So we do still expect the underlying profitability of our supermarket business to improve in the back half of the year as we exclude LIFO and fuel. W. McMullen: Yes. Just a couple of additional things. And Gary mentioned one of these in his prepared remarks, but the organization still has incredibly strong cost control, and this will be the fifth year in a row that we've been able to get over $1 billion of cost out. Obviously, that's an important part of that. And we do expect alternative profit to continue to be a little strong, a little bit stronger in the second half of the year as the first half of the year as well. Kelly Bania : Okay. That's very helpful. And just a follow-up with digital. So growth of 8%. I think that brings it about flat in the first half. Just wondering if you could help us understand how that compares to your expectation and how -- really, how Ocado is ramping within that? I see here this 34% growth in delivery sales. But just are you on pace with the ramp of Ocado? And just about your goal in terms of doubling digital sales, how do you feel about that today? W. McMullen: Yes. If you look, the thing that I think is always important is Ocado is one part of our overall digital strategy. And the thing that we're wanting to make sure that we have is a seamless ecosystem where customers can easily go between delivery, pickup and shopping in stores. And what we find is, by far, the majority of the people that -- customers that stop engaging with us on pickup come back into store and we capture that in-store versus delivery. So when you look at the overall seamless system, we're really focused on how do we -- and that's one of the reasons we introduced Boost, is how do we have that total loyalty across all the engagements with the customer. If you look at -- the thing that I'm super proud of our teams on the sheds that as we open them in the spokes is our Net Promoter Score from those continue to be world-class and incredibly strong. And that business -- and the customer continues to engage more frequently with us there. And overall, I'm pleased with the results, but we still obviously have plenty of work to do. I don't know, Gary, anything else you want to add to the question? Gary Millerchip : Yes. Thanks, Rodney. Just a couple of things. Overall, I would say, Kelly, we're pleased with the progress that we saw in the quarter. As you heard me mention in my prepared comments, we're certainly starting to see some traction on some of the key initiatives that we've been investing in, whether it's the Customer Fulfillment Centers that are powered by Ocado in both new and existing markets, the launch of Boost and as Boost continues to ramp up and we see about 25% of customers that sign up for Boost are completely new to digital. So that's a really good driver of the digital business as well. And then we're still in the early infancy stages of some of those convenience trip missions that I mentioned, whether it's Kroger Delivery Now with our partnership with Instacart, where products can be delivered, smaller baskets, within 30 minutes, and also the meal solutions, things like sushi and [indiscernible]. So a lot of really exciting developments and activities that we're focused on, and we saw some good momentum in those areas coming through, which is why we also shared in my prepared comments that we'd expect the momentum to continue in the back half of the year. I think the only other comment I would make is that we are taking a step back certainly to figure out what is the overall market digital growth is likely to look like this year because Rodney mentioned during his prepared comments that we're building a seamless ecosystem for the customer and what we're seeing and customers are moving between the channels and making the decisions of where they shop. And ultimately, we want to make sure the customer will go to Kroger and they're choosing to shop through the store or pickup or delivery, whatever works for them. And we certainly have certain assumptions around how we thought the digital market will grow this year, and we've sort of taken a step back as we look at the back half of the year and really sort of assess how we think the market overall is growing. But our focus is really on making sure that seamless ecosystem is winning the customers' loyalty overall, whichever channel they choose to shop through. Operator : Our next question comes from Spencer Hanus from Wolfe Research. Spencer Hanus : I just wanted to talk about the price gaps for a minute. Could you talk about how comfortable you are with where you're trending today? And have you noticed any change in your ability to pass through price increases as some of your peers have been a bit more rational on that front? W. McMullen: Yes, if you look overall, we continue to be satisfied with inflation and the pass-through. As Gary and I both mentioned, we're doing everything we can to minimize those increases and do it in a way that helps the customer in any way we can. And when you look at the total value proposition, we feel very good. When you look at fuel rewards, as I mentioned, we had 600,000 incremental households engaging in fuel rewards and record redemption from customers as well. So overall, we're doing -- I feel very good about the ability to balance all the pieces and minimize the impact on the customer as much as we can. We feel very comfortable with our price gaps. And price gaps is with a multiple of different competitors is something that we track on an ongoing basis. And we feel good about the everyday price gap. And as you know, we get great feedback from customers on our promotional approach and customers really appreciate the promotional values that we offer as well to allow customers to stock up on items they use the most. And we are very focused on using our data to make sure our offers are personalized for each household individually and discounts that just apply to them. And that's probably part of what's driving the fact that we had 750 million coupons downloaded as well. Spencer Hanus : Got it. That's helpful. And then just to go back to Ocado for a minute. What are you seeing from the facilities that are located in the new geographies versus your existing markets? And as we think about the profitability of these sheds, any updated view on when we'll get to breakeven EBITDA there? W. McMullen: Yes, I'll answer the first part of that and let Gary answer the second part of your question, Spencer. We continue to ramp up and the ramp in new markets would be among some of the best [indiscernible] sheds across the Ocado network. And as I mentioned before, the NPS scores are outstanding, a world-class or whatever positive you want to assign to them. And as customers engage with us with our Boost membership or our membership programs, that's causing them to even be more loyal as well. In terms of the financial side, Gary, I'll let... Gary Millerchip : Sure. Yes. Thanks, Rodney. I wouldn't say, Spencer, if there's anything dramatically changed in our view that we shared previously around how we think about the CFCs powered by Ocado maturing over time. I think, as Rodney mentioned, we've certainly been pleased with what we're seeing with customer connection and sales trends. And when we think about the Net Promoter Scores and the value that we're offering, we're seeing that the gross margin profile, if you like, of that customer and also the growth that we have expected is very much in line with what we have originally envisaged. As you know, I think one of the key things for us with the big facilities is it is a 4 to 5-year journey as you're building to maturity and building to scale. And so there are some elements of that, that until you kind of understand what the customer density looks like at scale, we're still figuring out some of that operational efficiency in the model. So there's nothing really new I would call out, but we continue to work on building that full picture. And as you know, in the first two facilities, we're only 18 months really in that journey of a 4-year journey overall to get to capacity. But generally, I'd say still consistent with what we shared previously. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS. Michael Lasser : There was about a 50-basis point acceleration in your 3-year geometric stack. Was that all driven by an acceleration in inflation from the first to the second quarter? And it looks like your guidance implies that you're expecting your IDs to go back to that kind of high 5% run rate in the second half of the year on the same 3-year geometric stack basis. So would that also imply that you're expecting the lower contribution from inflation in the back half of the year? W. McMullen: Part of it, Michael, is we're starting to cycle higher inflation a year ago. So it's really -- we do not expect inflation on inflation to be as high. So it's really driven by the cycling of where we were a year ago. And as you would recall, as we get later in the year, inflation ramped up very aggressively in the back half of last year. We expect the business to continue to stay strong and continue to make strong progress. We just don't expect the inflation to be quite as high as it was. The first part of your question, Gary, you may have been able to just -- yes, you're kind of working in and out. Gary Millerchip : Yes. Michael, I think we tend not to look at it specifically in the way that you're describing at that 3-year view. But I would say that overall, we think about our progress in the second quarter, we believe we were able to accelerate our growth relative to Q1 compared to the market. So we felt that from everything you could see, we were able to win customers and to change trajectory versus how the market was moving from Q1 to Q2. So we feel very positive about the momentum that we saw in the business in Q2. And as Rodney mentioned, we believe that momentum will continue in the back half of the year, but we are expecting while inflation will remain at heightened levels, we think it will start to taper out because with the cycling, call it, 4% higher inflation in the back half of last year compared to the first half of last year. So even if inflation does continue to grow, you're cycling about 4% higher inflation rate from the prior year. And we are starting to see a little bit of data that would say it's really hard to predict, and none of us had our perfect crystal ball. But if you look at the growth in cost inflation from Q1 to Q2, it would be less than the growth that we saw in Q4 last year to Q1 this year. And some of the forward-looking futures data on some of the key commodities are starting to show a little bit of signs that things may be leveling off somewhat. So obviously, there's been plenty of shocks in the last 12 months that can change that very quickly. But the data points that we can see right now, we think it's appropriate to forecast and provide guidance that it seems slightly tapering to the inflation rate in the back half of the year. Michael Lasser : Okay. My follow-up question is Kroger's been pretty nimble in managing its FIFO gross margin, as was evidenced by this quarter. Was some of that due to the ability to pass along price increases a little faster than you're getting the price increases passed along to you from your vendor community? And it does seem like some consumable retailers are announcing that they're going to make sizable price investments in the back half of the year. So how does that influence your view of the ability to sustain this FIFO gross margin performance over the next couple of quarters? W. McMullen: Well, obviously, all -- everything that you asked would have been reflected in our guidance for the balance of the year. We would -- most CPGs, you know well in advance of cost increases. So you're balancing the actual getting the cost increase along with what you pass through to customers. Obviously, you are -- on a weekly basis, you're looking at what pricing, where you are on spreads, better or worse than your competitors. And the other thing that I think it's always important to remember for a customer that shops at Kroger, there's personalized rewards that are individualized for each household that the market would never see. And that's something that's incredibly valuable for our customers in addition to our fuel rewards and other pieces. So I think you really have to look at the total value proposition. Gary Millerchip : Yes. Maybe just to add, Rodney, I think, Michael, from the perspective of how we manage gross margin, I think of it much more of a -- we're not trying to manage to a number every quarter. Obviously, we're managing it more long term and there's lots of moving parts that we manage. The tailwinds would be the work we do in sourcing, the mix improvements through fresh growing and Our Brands growing and new innovation products. And of course, things like alternative profit streams adding to that model as well. So we're still investing in the customer. And from our perspective, we feel very good about our ability to manage the model through the evolving environment. And overall, again, if you look at our rolling 12 months of gross margin, it's probably in that sort of 10 to 20 basis points of investment. And I think that's what we shared at the beginning of the year where we expect it to be. So we are delivering, we believe, on the plan that we shared. Operator : Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : My question is on the consumer to diagnose some of the changes we're seeing. It looks like there was some trade down brewing across all of consumer. And you mentioned that your business picked up from June throughout the quarter. So can you talk about if you're seeing a level of either trading down or movement to private brands you heard, is the level, is it stabilizing? Did it [indiscernible] inside with gasoline prices leveling off and [indiscernible] getting stronger now? Or would this [indiscernible]? W. McMullen: If you look at customer behavior, they're telling us they're modifying behavior more so outside of the grocery store than with us. Now the movement to Our Brands, what we always find is customers do it initially to save a little bit of money, but they fall in love with the product. So part of the continued acceleration of growth in Our Brands is driven by the value, but part of it is just the quality of the product. And that's been something that's been a long-term trend, not just a current trend. The customers -- it's one of the reasons why we're so proud of our overall offering is customers can move between different types of product. But we still see customers engaging in things that are fresh, and are healthy, those aspects as well. So we're going to be there forever how the customer wants and needs us to be, and we're going to be very agile as well. Simeon Gutman : Abbreviated follow-up is inflation. It sounds like we're not quantifying what the absolute level is. You all know we're going to see a moderation in the second half. Let's just say you're running in line with CPI for food and home. Could that actually get cut in half in the back half of the year? Is it going to be more moderate? And then in terms of elasticity, does it actually behave that quickly where you're seeing units for volume actually respond and go back up, so we're in the same place anyway? Gary Millerchip : Yes. I mean I think from what we see, we wouldn't expect it to be that dramatic a change. As I mentioned, I think we would expect there to be some flattening out of inflation in the back half of the year, but there's nothing that we see right now that would cause us to believe there's going to be a dramatic change in the level of inflation in the back half of the year. And from our perspective, I think it probably ties back to Rodney's earlier comment, we feel that we're monitoring and using our data very closely to adapt as to how customers change behavior. And we believe through the combination of fuel rewards, through the Our Brands portfolio of products that we offer and through the pricing and promotional offers that we have, we've got a very strong sort of portfolio of plans to be able to adapt to the customer with us. Operator : Our next question comes from Kenneth Goldman of JPMorgan Chase. Kenneth Goldman : I was curious, you mentioned Home Chef. Were there any other categories or broader departments where your brands were maybe surprisingly strong this quarter? I would assume the usual suspect milk and soy were healthy. But were there others where the -- I guess the share shift was bigger than you might typically see in this kind of environment? W. McMullen: Yes, it's a great question, Ken. And it's really broad-based. And the banner brand, I wouldn't say it's a surprise, but the banner brand continues to gain solid share. But even if you look at like private selection, which has a lot of unique and new products, the growth there continued to be strong as well. So it was very broad-based across really the whole store. Kenneth Goldman : Got it. And then on the higher OG&A this quarter, you called out a few reasons for -- and thank you for that. One of them was a onetime accrual catch-up. Can you give us a sense -- I don't think I heard how big that catch-up was? And then on the margin expansion initiatives, I recognize it's an ongoing process. But just in light of where the OG&A came in, were there any new initiatives launched? Is there anything that we should think about that may be unique that we haven't necessarily heard about yet? Or just is more of the ongoing process that you have? Gary Millerchip : Yes. Thanks, Ken. I think what I would say is overall, if you think about there's probably three pieces that impacted OG&A materially during the quarter. The one you mentioned, which was the true-up for the first half of the year on our incentive calculation based on our improved performance, we calculate what the [indiscernible] would be for the year. And so we have to catch up for the first 2 quarters in the year. Secondly, as you mentioned, we invested in some strategic initiatives that we believe will accelerate growth as we look into '23 and beyond in particular, and I'll come back to that in a second. The third would be, we were cycling 1 or 2 items that were -- as of the timing were particularly strong in Q2 last year. So when you add those three things together and sort of remove them from the number, we would have achieved an improvement in the OG&A rate during the quarter, which is why we kind of guided you to when we take out those three factors, which wouldn't repeat in our view for the rest of the year, but we would expect overall for the rest of the year to see OG&A rate improvement. It's probably fairly flat in Q3, but likely to be meaningfully better than that in Q4 is how we would think about it. And I wouldn't want to get into maybe breaking down the digital because we typically don't do that. But I would just say that all three of those together will really what caused the increase in the rates. As regards to the new initiatives, I think it is more of what you've seen before. It's more just that as we look at how the customer is changing and our business model continues to evolve. We identified 2 or 3 areas where we think there are opportunity to accelerate. And an example would be in shrink and investing in some new capabilities to be able to continue to improve shrink performance as we look out for the forecast for our model on shrink and that, of course, helps gross margin as well. And then I mentioned earlier, but we're really pleased with the progress that we made in health and wellness during the quarter, and we made some strategic investments in the health and wellness space where we believe there's an opportunity for us to continue to drive profitable growth, not only in the second half of this year as we cycle the vaccines for last year but also beyond in 2022 and 2024. Operator : Our next question comes from Robert Moskow from Credit Suisse. Robert Moskow : I wonder if you could give a little more color on the Smart brands initiative. Is it providing anything new to the consumer in terms of opening price points, like lower price points than before? Or you're really just consolidating several of your sub-brands to make it a little easier to shop? And then I just had a quick follow-up. W. McMullen: The majority is consolidating the sub-brands, just making it easier to shop. Those items are always great value for the money. The other thing that there would be incremental items introduced under the Smart Way brand in terms of just the absolute number of SKUs. So it's really a combination of introducing some new items and consolidating several sub-brands and making it easier for customers to shop. Robert Moskow : Okay. And then a follow-up on CapEx. You're not the first to lower CapEx guidance among consumer goods companies. And it all -- it usually seems to be because of project delays. But I imagine volume is less than what you had expected this year because the pricing is so high. So is there any correlation here between like a lower volume environment in an inflationary cycle and what your CapEx plans might be for the next couple of years? Gary Millerchip : I wouldn't say, Robert, really changes our view of the opportunity ahead of us. As you know, we've laid out a clear plan at our Investor Day in March, and we still feel really confident in both the growth model that we outlined and where we believe the strategic investments will make sense across the supply chain, across our store portfolio and obviously continue to invest in digital. So I wouldn't read into it that we're any less excited or have less confidence in those plans. It's far more the former point that you made. But when we look at some of the short-term supply challenges, when we look at some of the costs in the market in the short term, it just made more sense in our view to balance that plan and to adjust the schedule. So it would be far more in that camp than the other. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Lejuez from Citigroup. Unknown Analyst : This is [ Brandon Cheatham ] on for Paul. I was wondering if you could help us a little bit on the fuel margin cents per gallon were very strong in the quarter, but it sounds like you expect fuel to be a headwind in the second half. So can you help us, how much of the fuel margin was driven kind of by internal initiatives or external market forces that I guess you're not expecting to repeat in the second half? Gary Millerchip : Sure. Yes. Overall, our team did a fantastic job in managing fuel margins. And as I think you probably know, we -- our goal is to make sure we're very competitive on price, and then we give significant value back to our customers via our fuel rewards program that flows through our supermarket gross margin, not through that fuel P&L that we share -- the metrics that we shared on the call. So overall, last quarter would certainly have been some great work by our team in capturing value wherever they go through sourcing of fuel and how we promoted and drove engagement with customers. But a lot of it is also just to do with the volatility in the market and as prices were changing in the fuel market, which I think has been seen across the industry. So as we look forward, we believe we have a clear strategy around delivering great value for the customer, making sure we're sourcing the product really effectively, optimizing the reward program. Our view at some point is that fuel margins sort of normalize, and we don't think it's prudent for us to predict these extremely high unusual levels of profitability. So I wouldn't say we have perfect insight into what will happen to fuel margins in the back half of the year. We think it's prudent to bring them back to more of what we thought would be a normal rate at the beginning of the year. If it turns out that there is significantly greater margins on fuel then, of course, that would impact our outcome for the rest of the year, but we think it would be not prudent for us to be forecasting that. That's really how we think about the rest of the year. Unknown Analyst : Got it. That's helpful. And a quick follow-up. I was just wondering if you could break out price inflation, how much that drove ID sales in the quarter? And how much of that was offset by units? I assume, declined slightly in the quarter. Gary Millerchip : Yes. I think just a bit of color maybe to the last comment, we mentioned on this one would be that our sales growth was higher than the increase that we saw from Q1 to Q2, was higher than the increase we saw in cost inflation. So overall, we're pleased with the trajectory in our growth. And we believe compared to the market, we were able to improve our trajectory, Q2 versus Q1 compared to how the market overall performed. W. McMullen: Thanks, [ Brandon ], for the question. The other thing I think is important that I mentioned earlier is that we had household growth overall and loyal household growth as well, which is always important for the future. Rob Quast : Alex, we have time for one more question. Operator : Our final question comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : So maybe just a follow-up to the prior question. Just any perspective just on market share? It sounds like your GAAP versus [ peers ] may have narrowed this quarter, but just any thoughts on the performance this quarter and then how you're looking at that for the balance of the year? W. McMullen: Yes. The gap has continued to narrow and it's narrowed during the quarter as well. And if you look at it for the balance of the year, our teams would expect to continue to make progress and really proud of where we are. And we think the overall value for the customer and the overall seamless experience and focus on fresh continues to accelerate, and the customer continues to reward us for that as well. Rupesh Parikh : Okay. Great. And one follow-up question, just on CapEx as well. So this year, CapEx is pretty significantly below your prior plan. Do you believe we could be in a period of just lower sustained CapEx spend just given some of the headwinds out there? Gary Millerchip : I think, Rupesh, like I mentioned earlier, we feel very good about the plans we have to achieve our long-term -- or our overall TSR model around the growth that we've shared around growing earnings at 3% to 5% and our TSR at 8% to 11%. And we've got, I think, some very clear capital expenditure plans that we believe will allow us to drive that sustained growth. So I think we are being deliberate in the short term about making sure the -- if the pricing of certain supplies and products just would change their return materially then we're adjusting our timing there, and there are some challenges just around labor and raw materials and getting the plans executed in the time scale that we'd originally envisaged. But I don't think for us, we look at the announcements that we made this morning on our latest forecast of CapEx as being less excited about the prospects of investing in the business for growth. I think it's more of a function of just some of the short-term headwinds for us. W. McMullen: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. And as you know, I always like to share a few comments directly with our associates listening in as well. We are so proud of everything that everyone's achieved in this half of the year. Our outstanding associates continue to provide a world-class customer experience. And thank you directly on behalf of everyone for everything that you do for our community, our customers and each other every day. I'd also like to take a moment to recognize our Louisville and Delta divisions and our manufacturing and distribution teams who responded immediately to help in the aftermath of a devastating flood in Eastern Kentucky and a water shortage in Jackson, Mississippi. Our store, manufacturing and distribution teams went to work to offer company and customer donations of supplies and funds and delivered more than 55,000 gallons of freshwater to both communities when they needed it. A huge thank you for stepping up to support our neighbors when they needed it the most. I also want to congratulate our stores once again on achieving 100% execution of our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste food rescue. Your efforts provide healthy food directly to our neighbors who need it the most. Thank you for your commitment to creating and supporting communities free from hunger and waste. And thanks to everyone again for joining us today. That concludes our second quarter earnings call. Operator : Thank you for joining us today. This concludes the Q2 earnings call.

I will now turn the call over to Rodney. W. McMullen: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We're pleased to announce another quarter of strong results. powered by our strategy of leading with fresh and accelerating with digital. Our associates continue to create a seamless customer experience, delivering fresh and affordable food anytime, anywhere with zero compromise on quality, selection or convenience.  Our associates' incredible dedication means we have momentum entering the fourth quarter and we are continuing to consistently deliver a full fresh and friendly experience for our customers throughout the busy holiday season. It is clear that inflation remains top of mind for our customers and for our company. We are laser focused on helping our customers by providing fresh and affordable food. Research shows cooking at home is still 3x to 4x less expensive than dining out. And we are seeing more customers engage with our brands as a way to stretch their food budgets without compromising on quality. During the quarter, we continue to see many of the same shopping trends we observed throughout the year.  In addition to higher engagement with our brands products, Customers are downloading and redeeming digital coupons and continuing to showcase their cooking at home skills learned during the pandemic. Our breadth of choices, quality of fresh products and the value of our personalized promotions are helping customers navigate the current environment, and our customer-focused approach is working. We continue to see overall household growth and significant loyal household growth, which drives a meaningful portion of our sales volume. We are proud to serve as America's grocer, especially during the holiday season. As friends and family come together, we look forward to providing our customers the perfect ingredients to create cherished memories. At a time when 48% of customers have told us they plan to cut back on their Thanksgiving celebration due to inflation. We took action and made sure Thanksgiving was enjoyable and memorable for everyone. To do that, we introduced an easy guide for customers to build an affordable meal of our brand's products with all of the Thanksgiving favorites that a family could enjoy for as little as $5 a person. This is just one example of how we create amazing quality at a great price when it matters most to our customers.  We empower our customers to create lasting food memories by consistently executing against our go-to-market strategy, focused on Fresh, Our Brands, personalization and our seamless ecosystem. Fresh remains important in today's environment, and we are committed to bringing the freshest products to our customers' tables. Our Fresh for Everyone strategy is grounded in keeping products fresher, longer. Our end-to-end Fresh initiative is transforming these efforts. At the end of quarter 3, we have a total of 1,252 certified stores. At these locations, we see higher fresh sales and identical store sales. With these impressive results, we continue to roll out the initiative nationwide. As part of our end-to-end fresh initiative is our supply chain, where we continue to invest and enhance operations. We are improving productivity and maximizing our fleet by controlling more product movement across our network. Most importantly, we are using our data and science to maximize freshness for our customers.  Beyond our end-to-end Fresh program, we are bringing more Fresh products to our customers. During the quarter, Home Chef launched new plant-based ready-to-cook meals. They also collaborated with Kroger's in-house dieticians to launch our new simple and nutritious healthy meal kits. Home Chef continues to be an exceptional example of how Kroger's history of mergers help bring new and exciting capabilities to meet our customers' changing needs across the country.  Turning to Our Brands. We delivered another strong quarter in Our Brands with identical sales growth that outpaced overall identical sales. This was led by our Kroger and Private Selection brands. Customers continue to engage with the Our Brands portfolio, which offers high-quality products at affordable prices. Our Brands products are loved by every member of the family, including the pets. This quarter, we saw tremendous growth in our pet food brands as families continue to treat their dogs and their cats. As you know, they're like a member of the family. We continue to expand and diversify Our Brands portfolio at every price point. After launching Smart Way as our opening price point brand last quarter, we introduced several new Smart Way products this quarter and plan to roll out additional products next quarter. These products are meeting the needs of our customers on a budget, and we've already seen 2 million households to purchase Smart Way products.  In regard to personalization, our customers are looking for opportunities to save on the products they love. Our loyalty programs and personalized promotions allow them to do just that. We continue to use our leading data science capabilities to develop unique customer insights and offer targeted promotions on the products we know they love. This strategy is driving digital engagement with digital coupon downloads, 32% higher than last year. We anticipate these interactions will continue through the holidays with customers expected to realize more than $200 million in savings from our highly personalized digital offers.  Moving on to Seamless. We're improving our Seamless experience that brings our customers fresh products anytime, anywhere with zero compromise on quality, selection or convenience. We saw back-to-back quarters of strong digital growth led by our delivery solutions. This quarter, we introduced app enhancements that make it easier for customers to engage with our savings and promotion. We launched our first in-app flash sales and enabled our customers to clip digital offers directly from their cart.  Improving the customer experience is always top of mind for us, and Kroger Pickup now offers 3-hour pickup lead times at all stores in our network, with as little as 1 hour lead time in some areas. We're investing in digital growth initiatives, including expanding our Kroger delivery network in new and existing geographies. We are also growing Boost, our one-of-the-kind membership program. This is the industry's most affordable membership program, and it is foundational to growing our delivery service. We are incredibly pleased with our customer response to Boost as we rolled out the program nationwide earlier this year.  We continue to invest in our associates as part of our long-term strategy. In addition to investing in average hourly rates this quarter, we enhanced the benefits available to our associates. We expanded the eligibility for our 401(k) plan participants to encourage earlier commitments to lifelong savings, and we took steps to continue supporting working parents by increasing family lead time and our company-sponsored benefit plans. We are excited to celebrate amazing associates this quarter, who were recognized for their outstanding work and commitment to our customers. We were the most recognized employer for Progressive Grocer's GenNext honorees, with 28 of our young leaders recognized for driving change and innovation, both within the organizations and communities they serve.  Additionally, our KEPASA Hispanic and Latino Associate Resource Group was honored by the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce as the Employee Resource Group of the Year.  In summary, we are building momentum as we close out the year. We are excited to surprise and delight our customers this holiday season with high-quality fresh products at affordable prices. allowing customers to serve on the items that matter most.  And with that, I'll turn it over to Gary to cover our financial results. Gary? Gary Millerchip : Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger's relentless focus on delivering value for our customers was the foundation of our strong results in quarter 3. As Rodney mentioned earlier, our consistent execution of our go-to-market strategy is resonating the shoppers and driving increased customer loyalty. We were especially pleased with the balance achieved in our results this quarter as we continue to invest in our customers and associates, while also effectively managing costs to achieve solid earnings growth.  These results provide yet another proof point of the strength of our value creation model and our ability to operate successfully in different environments.  I'll now provide additional color on our third quarter results. Adjusted EPS was $0.88 for the quarter, an increase of 13% compared to the same quarter last year. This growth was driven by top line revenue and our disciplined approach to balancing investments with effective cost management. Identical sales without fuel grew 6.9%. Our Brands continue to resonate deeply with customers as sales grew 10.4%. The outstanding quality and value offered by these exclusive Kroger products is an important differentiator in our go-to-market strategy, and this is especially true during periods of high inflation. As we shared at our Investor Day in March, Our Brands products are margin accretive and represent a key pillar in our strategy to grow profitability while also delivering greater value for customers.  Digital sales grew 10% during the quarter with delivery solutions leading the way, up 34% year-over-year. Delivery solutions includes the Kroger delivery network powered by Ocado delivery from our stores via Kroger and third-party platforms and our convenience offering, Kroger Delivery Now. Our industry-leading Net Promoter Scores in Kroger Delivery are driving new customer engagement and best-in-class retention rates.  Gross margin was 21.4% of sales for the quarter. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased 5 basis points compared to the same period last year. This result reflected our team's ability to effectively manage higher product cost inflation and shrink through strong sourcing practices while also helping customers manage their budgets and keeping prices competitive. During the quarter, we recorded a LIFO charge of $152 million compared to $93 million in the prior year. This was primarily driven by higher product cost inflation in grocery. We still expect to see some moderation in inflation during our fourth quarter as we cycle higher inflation from a year ago.  Kroger's operating general and administrative rates decreased 3 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items compared to the same period last year. The decrease in OG&A rate was driven by sales leverage and execution of cost-saving initiatives, partially offset by investments in our associates. We continue to identify opportunities to remove cost from our business without affecting the customer experience and are on track to deliver our fifth consecutive year of $1 billion in cost savings.  Kroger Health had another successful quarter, delivering higher-than-expected sales and profitability despite cycling the impact of higher COVID vaccine revenue from a year ago. We continue to see significant growth opportunities in health care, and our Kroger Health team remains committed to ensuring our customers obtain medically necessary prescriptions.  Recently, we announced that we are terminating our Express Scripts agreement for commercial customers as of December 31. The Express Scripts contract would have required Kroger to fill our customers' prescriptions below our cost of operation, something we could not accept as we aim to keep our prices low for customers during this inflationary period. We expect this contract termination will reduce sales by about $100 million in Kroger's fiscal fourth quarter, impacting identical sales without fuel for the quarter by approximately 35 basis points. This decision is not expected to have an impact on operating profit or EPS.  Included in our results for the quarter is an $85 million pretax charge related to the settlement of all opioid litigation claims with the State of New Mexico. This amount was excluded from our adjusted FIFO operating profit and adjusted EPS results to reflect the unique and nonrecurring nature of the charge. This settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing or liability by Kroger, and we will continue to vigorously defend against other claims and lawsuits related to opioids. This settlement is based on a unique set of circumstances and facts related to New Mexico, and Kroger does not believe that the settlement amount or any other terms of our agreement with New Mexico can or should be extrapolated to any other opioid-related cases pending against Kroger. It is our view that this settlement is not a reliable proxy for the outcome of any other cases or the overall level of Kroger's exposure.  Currently, Kroger has 2 active matters pending in West Virginia and Texas scheduled for trial in 2023 and 2024, respectively. Kroger continues to believe that the claims are without merit, and that it has strong defenses to these claims. Kroger is also differently situated from many of the other defendants in these cases. Our pharmacy operations have a much smaller footprint, both in terms of the size of the business, and market share with respect to opioids, and we are proud of the outstanding work performed by our associates in delivering critical care and services to our pharmacy customers.  Turning now to alternative profit businesses, which are a fast-growing and key part of our value creation model. The traffic and data generated by our supermarket business continues to create a flywheel effect for alternative profits and growth this quarter was again led by retail media. CPG brands are finding significant value in our unique ability to build custom audiences that draw on our data to deliver precisely measured return on investment.  Last month, KPM added a new channel to its suite of retail media solutions, welcoming Snapchat into the portfolio. Advertisers are now able to use Kroger's proprietary capabilities to optimize Snapchat's immersive ad formats. We are constantly innovating to expand our reach, and KPM recently increased its programmatic advertising marketplace capabilities to include video and one of the fastest-growing digital media sectors, connected TV. These new frontiers will provide exciting future growth opportunities for KPN.  Fuel is an important part of our overall value proposition, and our fuel rewards program remains a key differentiator to help customers stretch their dollars during a period of high inflation. Fuel rewards engagement remained high during the third quarter and led to gallon sales, which outpaced the market. The average retail fuel price was $3.84 this quarter, versus $3.24 in the same quarter last year. And our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.50 compared to $0.42 in the same quarter in 2021.  The results we reported today would not have been possible without our incredible associates who continue to do an outstanding job executing our strategy and delivering a full, fresh and friendly experience for our customers. We have a long track record of investing in our associates and are committed to continuing these investments to ensure Kroger remains an employer of choice. Building on $1.2 billion of incremental investments since 2018 we have raised our average hourly rates by over 5% so far in 2022. During the third quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for associates in Columbus, Las Vegas, Chicago, Fort Wayne and pharmacists in Southern California, covering more than 28,000 associates. During the fourth quarter, we have also ratified new labor agreements for associates in Toledo and Nashville, as well as the Teamsters master agreement.  Turning now to cash flow and liquidity. During the quarter, cash flow was affected by increased inventory balances. This was predominantly due to higher product cost inflation, particularly in grocery, in stocks improving to pre-pandemic levels and forward buying of inventory in pharmacy. We are comfortable that our current level and mix of inventory is appropriate to support our future sales expectations and would expect to see an improvement in working capital during the fourth quarter.  Regarding capital expenditures, we are committed to investing in the business to support our go-to-market strategy and continue to see many opportunities to drive future growth. As shared last quarter, various initiatives have been delayed due to supply constraints, and we now expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $3.2 billion to $3.4 billion in 2022.  The net effect of higher inventory and lower capital expenditures for the year is that we continue to expect to generate free cash flow of $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion in 2022. In closing, I'd like to share additional color on our outlook for the remainder of the year. The Kroger team's consistent execution of our go-to-market strategy continues to build momentum in our business and gives us the confidence to again raise our full year guidance. We now expect full year identical sales without fuel of 5.1% to 5.3%, adjusted FIFO operating profit of $4.8 billion to $4.9 billion and adjusted net earnings per diluted share of $4.05 to $4.15, representing growth of 10% to 13% over 2021.  This guidance assumes a LIFO charge of approximately $500 million for the full year, which represents a $300 million headwind over the 2021 LIFO charge. Our third quarter and year-to-date results highlight the strength of Kroger's value creation model, which has proven to be resilient in different operating environments. Looking ahead, we remain confident in our ability to deliver attractive and sustainable total shareholder returns, and we look forward to sharing detailed 2023 guidance during our fourth quarter earnings call in March. And now I'll turn it back to Rodney. W. McMullen: Thanks, Gary. The results we've shared with you today are a testament to our business model strength and agility to support our customers in all economic environments. This is made possible because of the hard work and dedication of our incredible associates. Before we open the floor to your questions, let me provide a brief update on our pending merger with Albertsons. As you may know, I had the opportunity and Vivek did as well to testify before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on antitrust, competition policy and consumer rights this week. I shared with the senators that our merger will lower prices for customers starting day 1, continued investments in our associates and stores and customer experience and do even more in our communities than either company can do alone. We believe this merger will allow us to fulfill these commitments to our customers, our associates and our communities well into the future.  We are making early progress on our integration planning as expected and we continue to engage with all of our stakeholders and regulators. We are advancing our road map to close the transaction in early 2024. We look forward to working with the regulators as they review the transaction and do not have a substantial update at this time. We would ask that you focus your questions on our quarterly performance and our progress on our strategy.  With that, Gary and I look forward to taking your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]  And our first question today go to Michael Montani of Evercore ISI. Michael Montani : Just wanted to follow up on 2 fronts. One was into the fourth quarter guide, it appears that ID sales could be up around 4%. I just wanted to understand the deceleration there. Was that predominantly inflation and/or the Express Scripts? Or is there anything else to note? Can you share any start to the quarter information? And then I had a follow-up. W. McMullen: Yes. I'll start and let Gary finish it. Part of it is just cycling inflation from a year ago. We are beginning to now cycle the higher inflation a year ago. Gary, with that, I'll let you get into a little bit more asset specific. Gary Millerchip : Thanks, Rodney. And maybe just to confirm, so the trend in the early part of the fourth quarter has continued consistent with how we're performing in the fourth quarter -- I'm sorry, is continued consistent with outperformance in the third quarter. Michael, as to one part of your question there. I think the other piece is, Michael, yes, I think you captured them well is, as Rodney mentioned, we do believe this recycle higher inflation in the final quarter of 2021. We expect that to have some impact on the overall year-over-year growth in food at home during the fourth quarter. And obviously, we'll all see how that plays out.  And then secondly, we have factored in the impact of the ESI, the Express Scripts contract termination as well for January. So overall, I think if you kind of take our full year guidance, we'd be guiding between 4% and 5% IDs for the final quarter of the year. Michael Montani : Got it. And then just a follow-up on the margin implications. It looks like those could be flat to down slightly in the fourth quarter. So I just want to understand how do you see the competitive environment evolving? And then any cost initiatives that you could share with us there? W. McMullen: Relative to the competitive environment, we continue to see it pretty similar to how it's been throughout the year. all retailers are doing everything they can to minimize the impact on inflation to customers the best you can do. And we obviously would use our personalized and promotions that are directly focused on individual households because of things we know they love to try to help people stretch their budget. We're also, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, seeing customers continuing to move to our brands. And in the past, what we find is when customers move to Our Brands, that's very, very sticky because the high quality of the product and the satisfaction there. So what we find is even when things are getting normalized, Our Brands come out of that at a higher penetration level than going in, which is long term good for our business as well. With that, Gary, I'll let you get into. Gary Millerchip : Yes. Thanks, Rodney. Just a couple of bits of extra color, Michael, on the fourth quarter for you. As you probably gathered from the guidance, it would be a lowest quarter for year-over-year growth in what we shared for EPS. I think a few things to bear in mind there. First of all, we'll be cycling the strongest quarter from last year. Last year's EPS growth in Q4 '21 was the highest growth that we had during the year. So we're cycling higher growth from prior year. We'd assume fuel margins will be flat during the fourth quarter. So no real headwind or tailwind there, where, as you know, fuel has been a tailwind for us in the last couple of quarters.  And of course, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, year-over-year, LIFO will be around $100 million headwind in the fourth quarter of EPS because you may recall again that LIFO was only $20 million last fourth quarter. when we finalize the calculations. So that would be factors to bear in mind when you think about our EPS guidance. The only other thing I might mention is that you've heard me talk about on this call in previous quarters that when you look at our rolling 4 quarter sort of gross margin investment, somewhere between 10 and 20 basis points and OG&A leverage of 10, 20 basis points similarly to keep the business in balance. I would say that because we're cycling Q4 last year gross margin was relatively flat, and OG&A was relatively flat. So I would say you should probably expect our gross margin investment will be a little bit north of the 10 to 20 basis points in Q4, but our OG&A leverage should also be north of that 10 to 20 basis points as well. Operator : And the next question goes to Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research. Charles Cerankosky : Nice quarter. If you could talk a little bit about which categories did worse than inflation in terms of unit growth in which we're stronger on managing a lot of that was in the general merchandise. And also, Gary, could you comment on why identical sales growth, ex fuel was better than total sales growth ex-fuel? W. McMullen: Yes. In terms of the categories, the one you identified definitely would be the weaker category in terms of general merchandise. And that would be true at the Fred Meyer division, it would also be true across the rest of the organization as well. We continue to do well in those categories relative to the market. Our teams have done a great job of making sure they've been managing inventories relative to where the expectations themselves.  The other categories that would be weaker than the total would be categories where we continue to have supply chain disruptions. Gary and I both mentioned, overall supply chain is getting better, but we still have categories like cat food, dog food, baby formula some of those types of cold remedies, some of those areas continue to have some supply chain issues as well. With the identicals, Gary, go on. Gary Millerchip : Yes. Thanks, Rodney. Thanks for the question, Chuck. Yes, the biggest part of that, in fact, pretty much all of it, Chuck, would be -- you may recall at the start of the year, we shared that we've made the decision to stop dispensing certain drugs in our specialty pharmacy business because it didn't really tie to overall customer loyalty in our broader business, and it isn't profitable business for us. So we made that decision at the start of the year, and we adjust that out of our ID. So it's a like-for-like comparison, but it does create a disconnect between total sales and identical sales.  One of those examples is actually helping gross margin as well as we're making those decisions to make sure we're optimizing the balance of the business. Operator : And the next question goes to Ed Kelly of Wells Fargo. Edward Kelly : Gary, I'd like to ask you about the dynamic between the LIFO charge and the FIFO gross margin going forward. There's -- the FIFO gross margin have been good. And this year, there's probably $0.50 a share or more, I guess, in the LIFO charge in terms of the headwind. I mean assuming inflation eases, you get much of that LIFO charge back.  Do we just add that back to earnings? Or is there a dynamic to consider when we think about the FIFO gross margin? Presumably, some of this probably still needs to be priced. I'm just kind of curious, is the FIFO gross margin performance that we've seen, can you sustain that when the LIFO charge eases next year? Gary Millerchip : Yes. Thanks for the question, Ed. I think as you heard as mentioned on the call, we probably won't get into a lot of detail around 2023 guidance because we'd rather put it into context of the full picture for next year. As you might imagine, there'll be a lot of moving parts as we sort of bridge to share that color with you when we get to March next year.  I think overall, though, certainly, some of the elements that you talked about are going to be key factors when you think about what will be at play as you think about 2023, if I kind of talk more in general themes. I think overall, I would say we feel good to answer your question about gross margin that we are very focused on -- and I think are proven for our model, but there are levers that we can pull to manage costs and sourcing effectively to improve mix over time with some of the momentum in our brands and the opportunities continue to accelerate fresh performance and innovation.  So there are a number of areas when we look at the balancing gross margin that we believe we would expect there to be longer-term stability and our ability to manage that. I think when you look specifically at the moving parts for next year, I think there's going to be a lot of factors that will come into play as you think about next year.  You're right in terms of if inflation normalizes and your numbers certainly correct around the $500 million impact this year, which would be a $300 million year-over-year headwind because last year's LIFO was also inflated as inflation started to rise in quarter 4 last year. If you remember, our LIFO charge is calculated at a very specific week of the year, even though we try and estimate it throughout the year. So we would believe that as we'll get into guidance next year, obviously, when we share our earnings, and we're still sort of forming views around what we think will happen with inflation, but we're probably looking at most of the external views that you are and most of the analysts' reports that we can look at in the USDA, et cetera, would be in that sort of more of that 2.5% to 3-or-so percent inflation for next year. We'll obviously provide more color on what we believe, but that's sort of where most of the data that we see tend to be pointing towards. Edward Kelly : Okay. And then just a quick follow-up. Fuel margins have been really strong. I mean there's been -- some of your peers in the industry have talked about that moderating next year? I'm just kind of curious as to whether you share that view and how we should be thinking about modeling that going forward? Gary Millerchip : Yes. I think again, I'll maybe just broaden it because again, I think it's a little bit dangerous to pick on one element of the model for next year. I do think that fuel margins have had obviously a very good run. And generally, I think margins are improving over time, but there is -- there has been in the last 2 years, some major volatility in shocks in the market. I think it's hard to see those being cycled. So you look at margins earlier in this year, and I think that's likely to be a headwind next year in looking at the fuel profitability.  But again, I think you mentioned LIFO, another example for us would be -- as you look at our incentive plan, obviously, we're having a very strong year versus our expectations, having raised our guidance every quarter. So you get to more of a normalized incentive plan next year, assuming the budgets kind of your expected payout.  We continue to take costs out of our business and find new ways to improve leverage in the model. It has been 5 years, as you know, journey for us. We believe supply chain and alternative profits are potential tailwinds next year as we continue to improve efficiency in supply chain and all profit continues to grow.  So I think there's a lot of moving parts. And again, rather than sort of trying to bridge you to how all those play out. I think that's going to be a balance of puts and takes. And obviously, we're looking forward to sharing a lot more color when we get to March next year. W. McMullen: Yes. I think when you look at Gary's points overall, it's one of the things that's so important about our overall business model because we do have a lot of moving parts, and we've invested a ton of work and effort our whole team has over the last several years to reinvent the business model and make sure the business model can be successful in every economic environment. And to me, Gary's point that he was sharing really highlight that as we look forward. Operator : And the next question goes to Scott Mushkin of R5 Capital. Scott Mushkin : So the first thing I wanted to -- so the first thing I wanted to get some answers to a little bit is the market share, you guys market share. It seems to have stabilized, maybe even growing a little bit. Do you agree? And what do you think is leading to that? W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at market share, the trends continue to improve, and we feel good about where we are, but we're not satisfied with where we are. We believe the work that we're doing on Fresh is a key part of driving that.  And obviously, just the continued personalization and making sure that we have a customer experience for its household to household type relationship. And then Our Brands always shines when an economic environment gets a little tougher. So it's really those things working together.  And then our store teams continuing to do a good job of improving on friendliness. And I make that comment based on what customers tell us how we're doing, not just my opinion of how we're doing. Scott Mushkin : Great. And then my second question is a little bit more short term. I mean we've heard some retailers, not necessarily in the food industry, but some retailers that the consumers behave or kind of changed somewhat abruptly as we work through the fall. I mean, is that something you guys have seen? And if yes, do you think it's started to leak into the competitive environment? W. McMullen: Yes. It's a great question, Scott. And when we talk to our customers, they're telling us they're changing. But so far, they're changing on purchases other than food. So it's -- they are still prioritizing food. It gets a little bit back to one of the comments I made. It's still 3x or 4x cheaper to eat at home versus going out to a restaurant and so many more people have learned how to cook.  So if you look at the behavior changes other than the movement to our brands and being much more aggressive on downloading digital coupons and engaging with some of our promotional offers. That's really the only behavior we've seen in our business outside of the comment I made earlier on our general business, but that's a much smaller part of our business than many of our competitors. Scott Mushkin : And the competitive environment, has it changed? W. McMullen: No. It's all -- as you know, it's any place you look across the country, you'll see it in different stages. And -- but overall, what we see is pretty similar to what -- how it's been. Operator : And the next question goes to John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Partners. John Heinbockel : So Rodney, I want to start with a big picture here. When do you guys think about -- because you've got the data, if you think about growth in households, right? So if you're going to comp, let's say, I don't know, 3% or 4% longer term, household growth would be what of that and comp growth with comp households would be what? How do you think about that? And then when you -- is there any way for you to dive into your penetration, right, with your deciles and where the biggest opportunity is? W. McMullen: I will start and then Gary, please add any color you want. But if you look long term, we always build our business model around 1% to 2% inflation. And if you -- as you know, any given year will be different than that. But longer term, we've always felt that, that's kind of where fundamental inflation will be. Obviously, over the last couple of years, it's been completely different than that.  As I shared in my prepared remarks, our oil household growth was very strong this quarter, and it's been moving in the right direction. When customers first become a loyal household, what we find is, over time, we get a higher share of that household growth. And we really are seeing that what we define as our seamless experience where a customer can engage with us where we deliver, where they pick up in store and shop in store, it's that combination together that earns us the right.  So as our loyal household grows, we get a higher share and that should be a tailwind to our identical sales growth over time. And that was the reason that we talked about it, and it's something, internally, we spend a lot of energy on it. And I know, Gary, is there any other color that you think would be helpful for people to understand. Gary Millerchip : I think you covered it well, Rodney. I guess the only couple of extra points, John, I would maybe add, I do think, as you know, our core strategy is to grow existing loyal customers and what was really pleasing in the quarter as we saw 2.5% growth in loyal customers. So we're seeing customers move through the loyalty curve, and that's always been carry the strategy to really deeply reward customers and grow that relationship. I think what we're also seeing though is that as Rodney mentioned, we're building that Seamless capability with digital, we are starting to now attract a larger number of households too and the investments we're making in digital are creating that capacity to grow households as well.  I think the one thing on the loyal house, as I would say, too, is what we saw during the quarter have seen the last couple of quarters is that maybe that more affluent customer that has shopped maybe a larger number of retailers before that's consolidated more of their trips and total basket with Kroger as they may not need to adjust their budget because of inflation, but they feel it's the sensible and responsible thing to do, and they see Kroger as a great place to get the right quality at a great value as well, and we're seeing that consolidation happen. John Heinbockel : And just one more quick thing. Just conceptually, I know you don't want to talk about anything beyond this year, but right? You've raised the EBIT guide quite a bit right now you're up in the high 4s. When you look at '22, what was in there, maybe the good guys and the bad guys that kind of work against each other. I'm sort of wondering how sustainable is that new level of profitability? Again granted, the margin is not up as much as the dollars are. How do you think about that in terms of how representative of that performance is and what goes and comes next year off the P&L from this year? W. McMullen: John, as you know, we manage our business on dollars. And for us, growing dollars is what creates a sustainable business model long term. And we always view that the better offer that we can be able to afford to give to our customers the more sustainable that is, and the only way we can do that is by managing our costs and continuing to find and identify areas of waste so that we can reduce that and fund that. Fundamentally, as you look at Kroger, we still would have that same strategy and we'd still expect that over time because what we find is that really connects well with the customers. We -- that allows us the capacity to continue to invest in our associates and support our communities. And when we do those 3 things right, the shareholders benefit.  So I know broad picture, that's what we would do, the way we look at things. And obviously, with everything we do, we try to make sure we're doing it in a way that's sustainable long periods of time. Operator : And the next question goes to Kenneth B. Goldman of JP Morgan Chase. Kenneth Goldman : It's important to list my little initial [indiscernible] I'm just curious, the -- it's the second quarter in a row that you've lowered your CapEx guidance. I understand why you've been clear about that. And as Rob Moskow pointed out last quarter, you're not the only company to feel that pressure. I'm curious though, at what point is it reasonable for us to not be concerned, but sort of be aware of the potential impact on your growth from not being able to expand in a way that you'd like. I'm just curious how it affects anything in the near term, if at all? Gary Millerchip : Yes. Thanks, Ken. For us, I don't think it's really something that we're concerned about. We obviously did have very ambitious plans for CapEx this year, playing some catch-up from last year. And we still believe the projects that we have on the horizon are going to be generating significant value for the company in the future and support our growth plans.  But when we looked at the expectations for the rest of the year, there are a number of large projects, whether it's in supply chain or some of the stores, just where it's just taking longer to get them completed or there are some costs where it just makes sense to pause for a period of time and reintroduce when we believe that those costs will be more rational.  So from our perspective, we don't look at it as having a major impact on our growth model. As you know, we kind of historically were at sort of that $3.2 billion to $3.3 billion of CapEx spend a year. We've moved it up to $3.5 billion, being our sort of target range. And I would still say that's probably directionally where we'd want to be long term, to be pushing to the top end of our TSR model.  So we do believe it's important to be investing in the business, and we can still see plenty of opportunities to support that growth, but we just thought it was based on how long it's taking with certain things to get projects completed with supply availability that we think it's going to be a -- some of those projects will now blend into 2023, but we don't have a concern today about it impacting our growth algorithm. Kenneth Goldman : Got it. And then Rodney, I very much respect your request for us not to ask about the transaction. I won't ask about it. But I am curious, is there a plan ahead to sort of have give updates to investors on a separate kind of form just because it's obviously such a big part of the story from here. I think people don't want a black hole or a vacuum of news. So I'm just curious what the plan is to kind of update investors on progress? Is it just you'll let us know during each quarter what's new and that's kind of it. And then we won't have any Q&A around that. I'm just trying to get a sense of that kind of news flow from here. W. McMullen: Yes, it's a great question, Ken. And it's something that we're going to obviously manage in a very transparent way. And we wanted to go ahead and include it in this quarter, just the context of what is new, and that's what we've shared.  If there was something material, we would share it between quarters. But in all likelihood in the foreseeable future updates would be on a quarterly basis. But if it was something material -- what we try to do on disclosure is if our roles were reversed, what is it that we think it would be helpful for someone to know, and that's what we always try to do. So -- and obviously, feel free to give us feedback when that doesn't feel right to you because we appreciate the feedback. Operator : And the next question goes to Michael Lasser of UBS. Michael Lasser : Rodney, why wouldn't the grocery sector being more competitive and see more price competition in 2023 given that the consumer is going to be under pressure there's going to be your competitors who are going to want to try and gain some share given the potential distraction from the uncertainty of the merger with Albertsons? Many consumable retailers will have this LIFO gross margin benefit into '23, and there's going to be disinflation where at times, it could be easier to make price investments in an environment of disinflation than it is when there is an inflation. W. McMullen: Yes. It really gets back to overall. I think it's incredibly important to understand that we connect with the customer in multiple ways, and Fresh is a critical component of that. We fundamentally assume over time, the market is going to get more competitive. We've done that for 25 years. We'll continue to do that. And that's the reason why we put so much investment energy on personalizing experiences, supporting our associates in ways -- any way we can, pay, continue in education, even additional support on mental health and especially in today's environment.  And what we have found in every environment by supporting and connecting with the customer from a full fresh and friendly experience and then having good prices and very aggressive promotion and then personalizing the experience, we're able to support the customer.  One of the things that also supports gross margin as we continue to expect larger growth in our Fresh departments, which have higher margins in center store. And then when you look at our alternative profit businesses and some of those businesses have margins better than what the center store would be. So for us, it's -- you really have to look at all of those things together and look at those things over time, and we feel really good about the business model that we continue to develop and grow at our company. Michael Lasser : Understood. And my follow-up question is on the outlook for inflation. What are you hearing right now from your vendor can be about their desire to raise prices into 2023. Gary, you said previously that there will be -- or some of the prognostications are for 2.5% to 3% food at home inflation next year.  If you were to not raise another price from here, how much inflation benefit would Kroger experienced in 2023 just from the wraparound effect of what you've already raised this year? And then when you meant to 2.5% to 3%, would it be another 2.5% to 3% on top of that? W. McMullen: Well, I'll make a couple of comments, and Gary, you can think about some of the specifics. If you look at in our fresh departments, clearly, inflation is slowing down in many categories. Chicken would be an example. You're starting to see that in some of the other categories as well. And I always make the comment high inflation solves high inflation because farmers produce more when their margins improve.  If you look at on CPG companies themselves, right now, it's kind of mixed. Some CPG companies are willing -- much willing to have higher prices and give up growth. And what we find is when CPGs do that, our brand is so strong, we really gained share. And that helps the customers budget and it also improves the stickiness and the loyalty of that customer as well. So it's -- what do they always say, all short statements and economics are wrong. And I really think you have to look at all the moving parts. I don't know, Gary, anything else you want to add to Michael's inflation? Gary Millerchip : Yes, I think you covered it well, Rodney. I think Michael, as Rodney mentioned, we're seeing that Fresh is certainly starting to see some change in trajectory on inflation. So I think it is the grocery category that's the most stubborn if you like, in terms of where it's holding in inflation at the moment. And as Rodney said, I think from -- as we look forward from our perspective, if that were to continue without being sort of supported by true cost increases, then that creates an opportunity for us with our brands to improve margin and grow share over time. So I think that's the way we think about it in general. Operator : And the next question goes to Kelly Bania of BMO. Kelly Bania : Kelly Bania from BMO. Just a couple of simple questions. I guess, as we think about the comp here or the IDs in the back half, can you just help us understand how much inflation drove the upside there versus tonnage or -- you talked quite a bit about your fresh initiative. Is it those stores? Just helping us understand where the upside is coming from? And then on top of that, we often talk on the food service side of the industry about volume and tonnage, I guess, is the way you talk about it relative to 2019. And I'm just curious if you can help us understand where you are in terms of volume or tonnage, however you think about that relative to 2019 levels at this point? W. McMullen: Gary, I'll let you talk about the -- a little color on the IDs and then on the foodservice after you finish Health. I share some things there. Gary Millerchip : Okay. Great. Kelly, I think overall, we mentioned it in their prepared remarks somewhat as well. We've seen inflation starting to level. It's still obviously at very heightened levels. But if you look at the trend quarter-over-quarter, it really narrowed down to less than 1% increase in inflation in our Q3 versus our Q2.  So what we were pleased about was in that context, the continued momentum in our overall ID sales when we look at our Q3 performance versus our Q2, and I think a lot of that ties to some of the prepared remarks that Rodney also shared around household growth that we're seeing and really some of the defying more share of wallet from loyal customers and seeing lower customer growth. So that's the piece that I think we've been the most pleased around.  And we continue to perform really well with winning that first large basket with customers. We continue to see strong momentum there. And even as customers have continued to adjust their behavior as they kind of wrestle with inflation and decide how to balance budgets, we've been really pleased with how our overall pinning that first basket has continued to maintain strong momentum. W. McMullen: Yes. On foodservice, volume would actually be above where we would have been in 2019. For us, when we look at foodservice or food -- we are always -- I never know quite what to call it other than it's a great meal, easy to cook, easy to heat up, easy to assemble. It was the reason why strategically we merged with Home Chef because we thought Home Chef on its own had great trends and could continue to grow.  We also felt like their capabilities we could leverage back into Kroger to further improve our mill pit and a great restaurant quality meals would be an example. If you look at sushi, we're the largest sushi restaurant in the United States as an example. Obviously, we partner with a lot of third parties and local entrepreneurs on that, sandwiches and all those things. So we see food service as an important component of our growth, not so much relative to 2023. But as you start looking out at, say, 2025 and beyond, and being -- having an amazing quality meal that's easy and leveraging our delivery network or pickup network is an important part of the growth as you look longer term. Operator : Next question is Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : I just had one question just on OG&A leverage. So this quarter, there was minimal leverage on a very strong comp, and that appears to be driven by wage pressures. So as you look forward to next year, just any insight in terms of how you guys are thinking about wage crushers at this juncture and whether you think the OG&A leverage point could be lower? Gary Millerchip : Yes. Rupesh, thanks for the question. Maybe just a little bit more color on Q3 and Q4 as well because I think there's a little bit more to the story there as well that's worth understanding. I would say that certainly, you're right, the -- we saw a lot of benefit from sales leverage and productivity improvements during the quarter.  The team did a great job in really managing costs, considering the inflation that we're facing in some of those cost areas. We would have also had higher incentive plan costs year-over-year in quarter higher technology costs. We're investing in a number of areas that we're seeing growth in year-over-year. And some of that is maybe flipping from capital to operating expense because as you move more to cloud-based activity.  It just -- it does change the mix there as well. And we also invested, as we did in Q2 in some consultants and some advisory work to help build future momentum in the growth. So I would say the underlying improvement in productivity was stronger than the quarter would have suggested, and we feel good about the ability to leverage OG&A and fund the average hourly rate increases that we're seeing.  In fact, as I mentioned earlier, the Q4 number as we're cycling a fairly flat OG&A rate in Q4, we would expect to be north of 20 basis points of leverage in the fourth quarter this year as we head into next year. Operator : And the next question is our final question to Robert S. Ohmes of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kendall Toscano : This is Kendall Toscano on for Robbie. I just wanted to see if you could give any more color on how traffic looked during the quarter. What kind of trends you're seeing with items in the basket and number of trips to the store? And then, I guess, as you're expecting inflation to moderate a little bit in the fourth quarter, what you would expect on those items going forward? W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at the overall trends in traffic, it continues to be improving. Obviously, the overall basket itself is heavily driven by inflation. But as I mentioned earlier, our trends on market share are moving in the right direction and continue to go in the right direction. In terms of the last part, I don't know, Gary, on inflation? Gary Millerchip : I think probably similar to what we shared earlier, I think overall, as we're looking at the way the customer is changing behavior, as Rodney mentioned, trips improving, generally fairly consistent, I would say, over the year, but we are seeing higher trips from those loyal shoppers that have traditionally shopped in many different retailers for different categories and now seeing that trip consolidate to Kroger. I think is an important trend that we've seen throughout the year and continue to accelerate in the third quarter. W. McMullen: Yes. Gary, I think that's a great point, and thanks for the questions. And for everyone, thank you for joining us today. As always, I always like to share a few comments directly with our associates listening in because so many of our associates take the time to do that, which we appreciate. This is the time of year we truly shine.  Our special holiday film made clear. We create the opportunity for our customers to transform today's holiday moments into tomorrow's memories. We've had the pleasure to hear from countless associates former associates and customers about just how touching this film has been. I know I can't watch it without getting a tear in my eye. And just reminding all of us how special it is to share favorite meals with those we love most.  Thank you to our teams who put this together. Thank you for our teams who make the memories happen. It's a wonderful way to kick off the holiday season. As we all prepare together with our loved ones, I am so incredibly proud of our associates across the Kroger family of companies. We have accomplished so much this year. Thank you for the many ways you serve our communities and uplift our customers and each other. This concludes our call for today. We wish everyone a happy holiday season. Merry Christmas, Happy New Year and encourage you to stay safe. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This now concludes today's call. Thank you so much for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning, and welcome to The Kroger Co. Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]  Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Rob Quast, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Rob Quast : Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen and Chief Financial Officer, Gary Millerchip. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions, and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Company assumes no obligation to update that information. This morning, we released a presentation to accompany our call today, which can be found on our Investor Relations web page at ir.kroger.com. We encourage you to refer to these materials as Rodney and Gary will make references to the presentation throughout the call. During our prepared remarks, we will share our fourth quarter and full year results. We will update you on the progress  our team has made since our Investor Day last year on our Leading With Fresh and Accelerating With Digital strategy. We look forward to returning to a full Investor Day in 2024, where we expect to share detailed plans for how we will achieve synergies and maximize shareholder value from our merger with Albertsons. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to 1 question and 1 follow-up question, if necessary.  I will now turn the call over to Rodney. W. McMullen: Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'd like to start by sharing how incredibly optimistic I am about Kroger's future. Our performance last year demonstrates how Kroger is consistently delivering for our customers, our associates and our communities and by doing so, creating value for our shareholders. Since announcing our Leading With Fresh and Accelerating With Digital strategy at our 2020 Investor Day, we have made tremendous progress against our commitments. As you will see from the chart on Slide 6 of the presentation deck Rob mentioned, we are delivering a fresh, affordable and seamless shopping experience for our customers with 0 compromise on value, quality, selection or convenience. We are advancing our purpose to feed the human spirit by significantly increasing associate wages and uplifting our communities. And we are delivering on our financial commitments through our strong resilient value creation model. With this strategy, we exceeded our financial goals and delivered attractive total shareholder returns during the past 2 years. In 2022, customer preferences shifted in response to inflation and macroeconomic uncertainty. Our customers were looking for more ways to stretch their budget. The gap between food at home and food away from home spending grew in the fourth quarter as more customers gravitated toward affordable meal solutions that restaurants simply can't provide. Our research shows that cooking at home is 3 to 4x less expensive than dining out. And as Kroger was there for our customers, innovating quickly to meet their needs and wants, our nimble and customer-focused approach helped us deliver strong results in 2022, leading to total household growth and enhanced customer loyalty. We saw an especially strong response in our higher income households as this segment grew by 1.1 million households, further illustrating the resiliency in our model and strong value proposition we offer customers across all segments. Gary will get into the specific details of our 2022 financial results and outlook for 2023 a little later. Before doing so, I'd like to spend some time reviewing how each pillar of our go-to-market strategy provided meaningful and measurable customer benefits last year and how we will accelerate those benefits in 2023. The foundation of our go-to-market strategy is fresh, our brands, personalization and seamless. By delivering on these 4 pillars, our customers win and Kroger attracts new and more loyal customers. At the center of our go-to-market strategy is a superior customer experience. We deliver that by consistently providing customers a full, fresh and friendly experience. Kroger continued to demonstrate operational excellence in 2022 as we saw improvements in all 3 metrics. We believe our go-to-market strategy is creating a unique value -- customer value proposition designed to perform in many economic environments. We will continue to invest in our pillars and the customer experience to differentiate the value we offer. First, leading with fresh. As an important influence on where customers shop, we are constantly improving how we bring even fresher food to our stores and e-commerce experience. Our end-to-end fresh initiative is changing the way our teams deliver on our commitment to freshness and we are incredibly pleased with this success. In 2022, more than 1,400 stores implemented the end-to-end produce solution, driving measurable increases in both fresh and total store sales. In 2023, we will continue innovating the fresh experience to drive customer satisfaction and improve our product mix. We continue to improve inventory management tools, strengthen our supply chain to deliver additional days of freshness and enhance our offerings to meet customer demand. As a reminder, our merger with Home Chef brought significant capabilities in in-store and restaurant quality meal solutions. We will be expanding our home chef production facilities to meet this growing customer need. Next, Our Brands. The Our Brands portfolio allows us to offer exciting products at great value while driving incremental sales and improving margins. Our Brand's quality and value proposition is especially important when inflation is affecting so many of our customers' lives. To meet the needs of customers on a budget, we launched a new opening price point product line called Smart Way. By consolidating and simplifying several brands into one, we are making it easier for customers while creating a point of differentiation across the full portfolio. We will continue expanding Our Brands to more categories with innovative product offerings. Our goal is to help every customer find high-quality, affordable products they love from pantry staples to fresh food to ready-to-heat restaurant quality meals. Now I'll move to personalization. Our data science teams are using predictive science to serve customers the right products at the right time and at the best value. Because we know our customers so well, we were able to provide recommendations to start their baskets and deliver personalized offers on the products most important to them, saving them time and money and making their lives easier. In return, our customers reward us with their trust and loyalty, consistently ranking us among the best at being able to offer personalized savings and solutions that meet their needs. In 2022, we grew loyalty as our customers more deeply engaged with personalized coupons and fuel rewards. As customers look for more ways to save, digital coupon engagement hit an all-time high during the year. Our combined paper and digital coupons helped save our customers more than $1.4 billion on products they need and want. That's on top of our everyday promotions and all the other value we offer. To provide even more value, we launched Boost, the industry's most affordable membership nationwide in July. Early results are exceeding our expectations with incremental engagement and overall household spend. We are evolving Boost with new benefits to further broaden its appeal and create additional customer value. In 2023, we will make significant investments to build out our personalization capabilities, including increasing the use of real-time data to predict customer needs, which will support sales growth during the next 3 years. Finally, turning to Seamless. Seamless is growing in importance among our customers, and we expect it will be a significant growth driver over the next several years. We have built a digital platform that offers a seamless shopping experience with 0 compromise, allowing customers to shift effortlessly between store, pickup and delivery solutions. As you'll see on Slide 12, our combination of stores and dedicated fulfillment centers positions Kroger to serve all customer trips from in-stock shopping to rapid delivery on needed now items to large stock up orders. Despite the easing of pandemic-related shopping behaviors that led to a significant increase in online shopping, more and more customers are incorporating e-commerce into their daily permanent routines, recognizing the value and convenience online shopping offers. We expect digital sales will continue to grow at a faster pace than overall food at home sales and believe Kroger is well positioned to deliver double-digit growth in over the next 3 years. As we work to become the most trusted online grocery destination, we are focused on 4 key areas that will position us to deliver that growth. We start by providing a compelling Kroger owned digital destination, where we offer customers exceptional value, personalization and freshness in a single, easy-to-use online experience. Second, we are focused on delivering best-in-class fulfillment, driving trust and loyalty by exceeding expectations for quality and freshness. Our delivery approach is unique in the fact that we have a large store network conveniently located close to our customers and large dedicated fulfillment centers designed efficiently to pick large orders. Our dedicated fulfillment centers provide the most reliable experience, the highest in-stock levels, best on-time delivery and one-of-a-kind white glove experience with industry-leading Net Promoter Scores. Kroger delivery customers are more engaged across our entire ecosystem, spending more and shopping with us more often. Looking ahead, we will continue to learn through our customer fulfillment network with a focus on driving profitability and efficiencies to ensure that we are well positioned to deliver sustainable, profitable growth while delighting our customers. Next, we are focused on reaching new customers and adding more shopping occasions. Our delivery network allows us to offer enhanced service to new customers, and we will also grow our share of wallet by increasing the number of orders customers place with us. Solutions like Kroger Delivery Now enabled by our vast network of conveniently located stores can connect customers to fresh groceries and household essentials in as little as 30 minutes. This seamless ecosystem makes any shopping experience simple for our customers. Finally, we are driving our profit flywheel and improving margins by reducing our digital cost to serve and growing our alternative profit streams. To accomplish this goal, we are lowering fulfillment costs, building the density of demand and last mile routing, engaging directly with our third-party vendors and growing digital retail media. Now let me share how we are accelerating growth in our model through alternative profits. During the last several years, we invested heavily in technology to transform our business and enter new high-growth and high-return businesses. These businesses contribute meaningfully to our results with alternative profit businesses achieving $1.2 billion in operating profit in 2022. Kroger Precision Marketing is one of our fastest-growing businesses and is well positioned to win within the U.S. retail media landscape, which is projected to be a $55 billion industry by 2024. What makes our retail media business special is our ability to help brands achieve a greater return on their media investment. For the fifth year in a row, KPM was recognized as a leader in the retail media space by the Path to Purchase Institute, which collects feedback from those closest to the retail media networks and accessing their effectiveness. KPM was recognized as a leader for many of its capabilities, including maintaining its leadership in targeting and measurement capabilities, a testament to the strength of our unique product offerings and the insights we bring to this emerging landscape. Our associates enable our success, and we are committed to investing in theirs. To remain an employer of choice, we support our associates development and holistic well-being. We provide our associates with the tools they need to grow their careers that they want at all stages. In 2022, Kroger was named as a Best Place to Work in IT for the fifth consecutive year and a best place to work for disability inclusion for the third year. We also continue to support our associates through investments in wages and comprehensive benefits. In 2022, we raised our average hourly rates by more than 6% and has now invested an incremental $1.9 billion in associate wages since 2018. Our average hourly rate is now more than $18 and more than $23 when you include comprehensive benefits. We are committed to sustainably increasing associate wages and plan to invest more than $770 million in associates in 2023. We value and respect our associates and investing in their success is just one way we demonstrate that. We take seriously our role in helping to create a healthier and thriving neighborhoods across the country. The centerpiece of our efforts is Kroger's Zero Hunger | Zero Waste social impact plan, an industry-leading commitment to build communities free from hunger and waste. Since launching Zero Hunger | Zero Waste, we have made continual progress toward our goals. We have directed more than $1.65 billion in food and funds to help end hunger, including donating more than 2.3 billion meals. We are making progress on our carbon emissions reduction plan and our brand's sustainable packaging goal. I'm especially proud of our incredible associates who helped us reach a key milestone this year with 100% execution of our surplus food rescue programs across each and every store across the company. Looking ahead, we will continue to focus our efforts on our ambitious goal of ending hunger in our communities and eliminating waste, especially food waste throughout the company. In summary, our proven go-to-market strategy led to enhanced loyalty and household growth as we help customers manage the effect of inflation in 2022. We are well positioned to sustain our momentum into 2023. And with that, I'll turn it over to Gary to take you through our results and expectations for 2023. Gary? Gary Millerchip : Thank you, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Before jumping into our 2022 results and sharing our outlook for 2023, I'd like to take a step back and remind you how Kroger's value creation model is enabling the company to deliver sustainable value for our shareholders. We believe our value creation model has been a key to delivering consistently strong results over the past 4 years and is positioning Kroger for growth in years to come. The go-to-market strategy that Rodney outlined earlier is the foundation of our model. Over recent years, we have invested significantly in our people, our customers and technology to create a leading omnichannel position in food retail. By executing our go-to-market strategy, we win customers in our core supermarket business, including health and fuel and drive significant customer traffic and data into our ecosystem. This, in turn, allows us to deploy our investments in technology and 84.51\u00b0 to deliver even greater value for customers and create new high-growth, high-margin alternative profit businesses. The value generated from these businesses enables us to reinvest back into our supermarkets and drive further store and digital traffic, creating a flywheel effect. We are evolving from a traditional food retailer into a more diverse food first business that we believe can deliver sustainable future growth and succeed in a variety of operating environments. As a reminder, since introducing this model in 2019, we have achieved consistent returns for our shareholders that have significantly exceeded our TSR commitment of 8% to 11%.  As you can see in the table on Slide 19, over the past 3 years, Kroger has achieved more than 19% compounded annual growth rate in adjusted FIFO net operating profit and approximately 25% compounded annual growth rate in adjusted EPS. Over this same time period, we generated adjusted free cash flow of approximately $9.7 billion and have returned a total of nearly $5.8 billion to investors via dividends and buybacks. Overall, we have delivered nearly 3x the expected return from our TSR model over this 3-year period. Importantly, at the same time, we continue to invest in the business to support future growth. This included improving our price position relative to key competitors since the start of the pandemic, increasing associate wages and benefits by 34% since 2018 and increasing the amount of capital investments allocated to technology and digital capabilities to enable top line growth and margin expansion. Our strong performance and progress with our model in recent years also gave us the financial flexibility and confidence to announce our proposed merger with Albertsons. Upon closing, which is anticipated to be in early 2024, we believe the merger will significantly accelerate our go-to-market strategy and deliver TSR well above our stand-alone model during the first 4 years post close. I'll now walk through our full year 2022 financial results. Kroger delivered adjusted EPS of $4.23 per diluted share, an increase of 15%. We achieved identical sales, excluding fuel of 5.6%. The FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased 9 basis points. This reflects the outstanding work of our merchandising and sourcing teams who are extremely effective in managing higher product cost inflation while maintaining competitive prices and helping customers manage their budgets. The OG&A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items, decreased 19 basis points, reflecting sales leverage and cost-saving initiatives, partially offset by planned investments in associates. And I'm delighted to say for the fifth consecutive year, we delivered cost savings of $1 billion in 2022. Our adjusted FIFO operating profit was $5.1 billion, an increase of 18% from last year. And the LIFO charge for the full year was $626 million compared to $197 million in 2021. Turning now to our fourth quarter results. Adjusted EPS was $0.99 for the quarter, an increase of almost 9%. We saw continued momentum in our identical sales without fuel of 6.2%. Underlying growth would have been 6.7% after adjusting for the effect of Express Scripts. Our Brands contributed another strong quarter with identical sales of 10.1%, reflecting the growing importance to customers of these exclusive to Kroger products. And digital sales also accelerated during the quarter, up 12%, led by 22% growth in Delivery Solutions. Kroger's FIFO gross margin rate excluding fuel decreased 1 basis point and the OG&A rate excluding fuel and adjustment items decreased 56 basis points. Fuel remains an important part of our overall value proposition. Our loyalty program, which can save customers up to $1.25 per gallon has been one of the many ways we have helped customers stretch their dollars over the past year and contributed to our gallon sales outpacing the industry during the quarter. The average retail price of fuel was $3.39 compared to $3.30 in the same quarter last year. Our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.51 compared to $0.44 in the same quarter last year. Adjusted FIFO operating profit was $1.27 billion, a year-over-year increase of 26%. And the LIFO charge was $234 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting sustained higher product cost inflation, particularly in grocery. This compares to a charge of only $20 million in Q4 last year. Included in our fourth quarter results was a $164 million goodwill and fixed asset impairment charge related to Vitacost.com. The talent and capabilities gained through the merger with Vitacost in 2014 have been key to advancing Kroger's digital platform and growing our digital business to more than $10 billion in annual sales. As our digital strategy has evolved, our primary focus looking forward will be to effectively utilize Kroger store pickup and delivery capabilities, and this reprioritization resulted in the impairment charge. Vitacost.com will continue to operate as an online platform, providing great value, natural, organic and eco-friendly products for our customers. Adjusted free cash flow for the year came in $800 million lower than anticipated. This was entirely due to movements in working capital towards the end of the year. The cause was a combination of factors including higher inflation affecting inventory, some forward buying to protect margins and timing of accounts payable and third-party receivable payments around the year-end. As shared last quarter, we feel comfortable with our overall level of mix of inventory, which is higher due to heightened levels of inflation and in-stocks returning to pre-pandemic levels. Looking over a 5-year time horizon and smoothing the volatility in working capital experience during the pandemic, we have seen an underlying benefit from working capital over this time period, and we would expect to see further improvement going forward. We remain confident in our ability to generate strong free cash flow. And as shared in our guidance this morning, expect to achieve adjusted free cash flow of $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion in 2023. Turning now to financial strategy and capital allocation. We will continue to be disciplined with our capital investments, prioritizing the highest growth opportunities that strengthen our business and deliver solid returns for our shareholders. As you saw in our guidance this morning, we are anticipating capital investments of $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion this year, which is consistent with our long-range TSR model. Our priorities for 2023 are aligned with our value creation model and are expected to drive future sales growth and margin expansion. To drive sales, our focus is on enhancing our store and digital ecosystem. We apply a data-driven approach to make decisions on a store-by-store basis, prioritizing store formats and locations with the highest growth potential. Additionally, we are continually enhancing our seamless experience including investing in technology to improve the customer proposition and augmenting personalization, which will, in turn, create additional alternative profit opportunities. We continue to invest in areas of the business that will drive operating margin expansion, including enhancements to our supply chain capabilities. These investments help improve margins and differentiate our fresh offering. And finally, an essential element of our value creation model has been our ability to take cost out of our business. We remain focused on eliminating waste in areas that did not affect the customer experience and we are making investments in technology to improve store productivity, lower digital fulfillment costs and reduce waste and shrink. These improvements will drive an incremental $1 billion of cost savings in 2023, which would mark our sixth year in a row of delivering $1 billion of savings. In closing, I'd like to share some additional color on our expectations for 2023. While there is still uncertainty regarding the economic outlook, our go-to-market strategy is resonating with customers, and we believe our successful value creation model positions us well to navigate evolving market conditions. Before I go into the details of our 2023 guidance, there are a couple of unusual factors that I'd like to highlight. First, Kroger's decision to terminate our agreement with Express Groups in December of 2022 is expected to have a negative impact of 150 basis points on identical sales without fuel. This decision is not expected to have a material effect on profitability. Second, 2023 will include a 53rd week. We expect the effect of this extra week at approximately $0.15 to our adjusted net earnings per diluted share for the year. With that important context, we expect to achieve identical sales without fuel of 1% to 2% in 2023. Excluding the effect of Express Scripts, our underlying identical sales without fuel growth is expected to be between 2.5% and 3.5%. We expect to achieve adjusted FIFO operating profit of between $5 billion and $5.2 billion and adjusted net earnings per diluted share of between $4.45 and $4.60, including the expected benefit of the 53rd week. We expect to grow revenue by continuing to invest in our customers through competitive pricing and personalization and providing fresh products and a better shopping experience across our store and digital ecosystem. We will fund investments in gross margin in 2023 by improving our product mix as we accelerate momentum with our Fresh and Our Brands initiatives and by growing our alternative profit businesses. As Rodney mentioned earlier, we will also continue to invest significantly in associate wages and this will be funded by our planned cost-saving initiatives. While we believe fuel margins will remain structurally higher than historical averages, fuel profitability is expected to be a headwind to our model in 2023 as we lap historic fuel margins from last year. Our 2023 guidance assumes a LIFO charge of between $300 million to $350 million as a result of lower product cost inflation compared to 2022. While this amount is well above historical levels, LIFO is expected to be a year-over-year tailwind and should more than offset lower fuel profitability. In terms of quarterly cadence, we expect identical sales without fuel to be above the top end of our guidance range in the first half of the year as we continue to experience heightened levels of inflation. In the second half of the year, we expect identical sales without fuel to be at or slightly below the bottom end of our range as we expect inflation to taper later in the year. We expect adjusted earnings per diluted share in quarter 1 will be slightly negative year-over-year as we cycle 22% growth in EPS from Q1 last year. Quarter 2 and quarter 3 are expected to be within our annual guidance range and quarter 4 is expected to be above our guidance range as we cycle the higher LIFO charge in '22 and benefit from the 53rd week. As you know from Rodney and myself this morning, Kroger is operating from a position of strength and the investments that we have made in our go-to-market strategy provide exciting opportunities for future growth. Our team is energized by these opportunities and we believe Kroger is well positioned to continue to deliver attractive and sustainable returns for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call back over to Rodney. W. McMullen: Thanks, Gary. Before we open up the floor to your questions, let me provide an update on our pending merger with Albertsons. During the past few months, we've spent time getting to know Vivek and the Albertsons leadership team. We are incredibly impressed with their talent, culture and commitment to their customers and communities. We look forward to bringing together our 2 highly complementary organizations to provide customers with lower prices and more choices while realizing the long-term value we expect this merger will deliver. We are working cooperatively with regulators responding to the Federal Trade Commission's second request and in discussions about the transaction, while also working to identify potential buyers for the stores, we expect to divest to obtain clearance for the transaction. We are pleased with the level of interest received thus far, and we'll work towards finding a solution that benefits all stakeholders. We remain on track to close the transaction in early 2024. During the quarter, we launched our integration planning efforts with the goal of preparing for a seamless cultural and operational integration. We expect to create customer benefits beginning day 1 post close. The integration team is developing work streams with clear objectives and milestones to deliver value for our customers, associates, communities and shareholders. We are pleased with the progress we've made to date, and we'll continue to provide updates as we have them. We achieved exceptional results in 2022, building on our record years in 2020 and 2021, and we exceeded our commitments in our Leading with Fresh and Accelerating with Digital strategy. Our folks strategy is focusing on our customers, our associates and our communities is working. Our customers are telling us that we're doing a better job serving their needs. We continue to improve our associate wages and comprehensive benefits with a 34% increase in the last 5 years. And we are helping to create healthier thriving communities through our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste work. We believe our momentum is sustainable and will only accelerate upon the completion of our pending merger with Albertsons. With that, Gary and I look forward to taking your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Partners. John Heinbockel : Rodney, I wanted to start with since it's the beginning of a new year. As you guys think about your consumer deciles, quartiles, however you look at it, what's the wallet share opportunity right, maybe from the average consumer to your best, most loyal consumer. And where is the -- when you do sort of a gap analysis, where is the gap? Is it fresh? Where are the biggest pockets, right, where the average consumer is not spending as much as the most loyal. W. McMullen: And John, thanks. I love the question. And we always look at it slightly different because we look at the opportunity is all the business. And even in places where we over-index, there's still a lot of opportunity. Customers that are most loyal to us will still spend 30% to 50% of their spending somewhere other than Kroger. And that's an opportunity for us to improve our position. When you look at Fresh, we start off with a higher share of Fresh than we do in the other parts. But it's an area where we're meaningfully better than our competitors. So our ability and focus on growing our business is to really -- what we find is full Fresh and friendly resonates with all customer types, and we do it in a way where there's 0 compromise. So a customer on a budget can get great value from Our Brands. They can save 7% to 10% by buying Our Brands versus national brand. If you look at our Home Chef and products related to that, a customer can get a meal for 1/3 to 1/4 of what it costs going out. So it's really all of those together. And our opportunity -- our sweet spot is always the customer that likes a good value for the money and Fresh is incredibly important and friendly is incredibly important. That's our sweet spot where we connect the best and that is a growing area across the U.S., and we operate in many markets that are growing as well. So for us, that's really our sweet spot and our opportunity and our strategy is oriented around that. And then technology just provides the support for that make it easier for the customer. John Heinbockel : Great. Maybe secondly, right, if you look at the Express Scripts impact, so how much of that is pharmacy versus none, right? And I know you guys have always said pharmacy customers among the most loyal customers. How do you think about losing trips, right, because of this and then maybe using right, your data, okay, we know who -- I think you know who the Express Scripts customers were. We can do incremental outreach to make sure we don't lose trips with those particular households. W. McMullen: If you look the numbers that Gary provided by far, the majority of that's pharmacy. Our teams are doing great work on using our discount cards to be able to help customers identify other alternatives. And in fact, in many cases, they're saving money. We're also going directly with some other companies to provide the benefit rather than going through a PBM. So by far, the majority of the estimate that Gary provided is pharmacy. And we're using the things that you said to make sure that we don't lose that customer connection and we don't lose the trip to the grocery store. I don't know, Gary, anything you want to add to that? Gary Millerchip : I think you said it well, Rodney.  I think that John described it, but work the team has done around using our data and personalization to make sure we're protecting the customer. We think it's working. Operator : Our next question comes from Ed Kelly of Wells Fargo. Edward Kelly : Thanks for all the color. A question for you to start. Rodney, just kind of big picture. We're coming off of an inflationary cycle that really none of us have ever sort of seen before. And obviously, there are a lot of implications associated with that. But as you look forward into '23 and sort of thought about providing guidance, how do you think the industry is going to evolve off of the heels of that? Meaning what's the level of inflation that you've embedded within your ID guidance of 2.5% to 3.5% ex Express.  How do you think about like the promotional backdrop and how that changes? Are you happy with your underlying tonnage for instance or volume given what's happened with pricing and what we've seen with comps at some like value players like Walmart, et cetera. Just kind of curious, is that how all of that played into the way you're thinking about guidance? W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at inflation overall, we would expect inflation to be higher in the first half of the year than the second half of the year and the quarterly insights that Gary provided really reflected that. If you look at the thing that we feel really good about, and I shared specifics on the prepared comments, the higher income customer is really resonating with our value proposition, and we're having meaningful increases there in terms of that customer. And one of the things I always think it's important for people to realize is the profitability of that customer is higher as well because they shop for the full mix of our stores and they would be buying more produce in Fresh departments and Deli bakery, which is driving some of that profitability shift. So when you look at overall, we feel really good on how we're connecting with our customers. We feel really good at how we're improving on Fresh. And when you look at the share that we're getting with the customer that really focuses on that, we feel good about. When you look at it overall, we're always striving to do better. And I feel good about the progress we're making. We're excited about the opportunities we have in front of us, and we still think we can continue to do better.  In terms of specifics on inflation, Gary, I'll let you share the specific inflation assumption because it's pretty -- during the year, it's obviously pretty wide range. Gary Millerchip : Sure. Yes. Thanks, Rodney. Thanks for the question, Ed. From an inflation perspective, what we're seeing at the moment is that we've seen in the last couple of quarters, inflation has really sort of stabilized. And what we're starting to see is in the Fresh categories, sort of deceleration of inflation, but grocery is -- has remained pretty stubborn in terms of the levels there. So we're assuming, as Rodney mentioned, in the first half of the year that a gradual decline, probably grocery remaining fairly stubborn where it is today, but some of the Fresh categories continuing to show some deceleration. And then we're expecting sort of towards the end of the year that we get to sort of between low and mid-single-digit inflation level rates about sort of 4% to 5% would be our assumption around where we think inflation starts to come down to in the way that we build our assumptions for the year. And obviously, Our Brand... Edward Kelly : Okay, just a quick followup... Gary Millerchip : Go ahead, Ed. Edward Kelly : Got you. Just a quick follow-up, Gary. The FIFO gross margin outlook for '23. I think there is a decent -- I mean, it seems like there's a decent impact associated with Express, given there's no P&L impact of losing the comp. Just how are you thinking about FIFO gross margin ex fuel in '23? Gary Millerchip : Yes. As you know, we generally don't get into a ton of specific guidance. But I would say, in general, we're thinking and the way we built our model is very much in balance and consistent with what we delivered in 2022 in terms of -- when you think about gross margin, we'll be continuing to invest in the customer in key areas of value whatever important to them, whether that's pricing, promotions continuing to roll out Boost, which creates a short-term headwind as you build the loyalty of the customer and get the incremental value over a longer period of time. We believe that there'll be some continued meaningful tailwinds in our gross margin rate as we continue to execute on our go-to-market strategy. So thinking about alternative profit streams. The work I mentioned in my prepared remarks about continuing to see improvement in Our Brands penetration, which is helpful to gross margin. And so we overall, think it's going to be a pretty balanced year. There's an awful lot going in there as we're investing in the customer, investing in the experience. But as our model is now kind of reaching more of a rhythm and maturity of delivering on those gross margin improvements that we're able to balance those things. I would say from an Express Scripts point of view and some of the other work that we've done around Kroger Specialty Pharmacy are making sure that we're really focusing on profitable growth in our health and wellness business that those probably create a call it, a sort of 10 basis point tailwind in gross margin, but a 10 basis point headwind in OG&A. It's kind of net, net neutral in terms of the operating profit impact, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, but it will change the optics a bit just because the sort of pulling those sales numbers out of our overall business model. Operator : Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Simeon Gutman : My first question, it's a little similar to Ed's question. If you look at the FIFO EBIT guided for 2023, essentially, call it, flattish. I'm just rounding relative to '22. If you divide the business up into core, I don't know alternative and maybe gas as profit pools, and I don't know if those would be the right 3, the big ones to focus on. Can you give us a sense of the movement within getting to that flat -- roughly flat for EBIT year-over-year? Gary Millerchip : Yes. I think what I'd probably say, Simeon, as I think about it, the sort of 3 bigger picture moving parts that I tried to sort of tee up the overall guidance with as well. So I think about it as the 53rd week adding, call it, $0.15 of earnings per share. So that's helping with -- think of $0.01 of about $9 million to $10 million. So I think if it's like $150 million tailwind from the 53rd week. I think of gas, so fuel being a headwind of -- in the sort of $200 million to $250 million range. And then I would think of the sort of core supermarket business is really sort of continuing to grow year-over-year. So the gap is more than offsetting the impact of the 53rd week.  The core supermarket business sort of executing on our value creation model, as I mentioned. So underlying sales growth in that 2.5% to 3.5% growth because the Express Scripts business really hasn't contribute to the bottom line, continuing to invest in the customer, continuing to execute on our plans around driving cost out of the business and improving mix and those things net overall getting us to a slight improvement.  And I'll probably -- we won't get into the specifics obviously of breaking down the individual pieces, but we really categorize all profit as part of the overall ecosystem because we don't have media revenue unless we're driving the digital supermarket business. So we very much look at it as a total ecosystem. Simeon Gutman : Right. And then as a follow-up on the backdrop regarding pricing inflation, it seems like the backdrop is maybe more oligopolistic than one would have thought, not that it's not competitive out there, but in terms of price and wondering what that's a function of and maybe what could disrupt it? Is that a fair assessment? W. McMullen: We would certainly describe it and look at it different than that. And we've invested in pricing -- I'm trying to remember for the last 20 years or so every single year and would expect to continue to do that. And we fund that through process change, identifying other things to get costs out. And an awful lot of our promotions are much more directed personalized to the customer. So it's not what you see when you go to a store to look on a shelf because we provide a significant higher percentage of our value to our customers through fuel rewards and personalized offers that are connected one-on-one from -- in using technology and digital so that each person is individual. So we would certainly not describe it that way. And we view it -- every year is incredibly competitive, and everybody is working hard to do a better job and the customer gets the benefit of that. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS. Michael Lasser : Between the comments that you had indicated at the early start of the call, where you're working on the profitability of your digital business, along with what it sounds like a slowdown in the rollout of your Ocado shed this year, have you evolved your thinking on the long-term profitability of digital sales for Kroger because you had previously indicated that you expected the incremental margin on an incremental dollar of sales to be at or above an in-store dollar of incremental sales. W. McMullen: When you look at our digital business long term, we wouldn't see the profitability be any difference in this supermarket when you look at it over a longer period of time. And if you look, what we find is a customer when they move online, they actually after a year engage with us more in store than before. So what we're really focused on is having an ecosystem where the customer thinks food, they think Kroger. And what we're finding is the customer routinely moves back and forth between the different channels. If you look at each piece of it, every single day, you're working to figure out ways to improve processes and take costs out. And then on top of it, obviously, retail media is an important part of the driver. So when you look at it long term, we really see no change in the opportunity and potential. We're incredibly excited and everything that we see, we think it will be more important in 3 years, 5 years, 10 years to have where the customer engage with us through multiple ways. And the digital channel is a critical part of that, and we find the customer engages with us digitally, even when they don't shop digitally. So for us, we see it as exciting as we did before. We don't see the long-term profitability being different. And we're working continually in terms of both internally and with our partners on how to improve processes. Gary Millerchip : Maybe just to add, Rodney -- Michael, to the sort of short-term answer to Rodney's long-term perspective, I would say that we are seeing the benefits flow through in the profitability that we talked about on prior investor meetings. So if you think about our existing digital business today, pick up through the store delivery, what we're seeing is the cost to serve. We had our best ever quarter for the cost to serve a digital order in the Q4 of 2022. Rodney mentioned media, the amount of media revenue we generate per digital transaction continues to grow. So those are 2 of the big drivers that we expect to drive digital profitability, and we continue to see improvements in '22, and we expect improvements in '23 that were actually part of the tailwind in the financial model I described earlier. So we remain on that path and we are making good progress. Michael Lasser : And Gary, just to clarify that, then why slow the rollout of the Ocado sheds? And my second question just at this time. To get to the slightly below the low end of the range for ID sales by the end of the year with still low to mid-single-digit inflation, do you assume that there's going to be a unit erosion by the end of the year as -- I don't need to tell you guys, groceries are expensive and in a tough economic environment that may get worse by the end of the year. The consumer may be pulling back even further, and we just want to make sure that you factored in some conservatism into your outlook. Gary Millerchip : Sure. Thanks, Mike. I'll try and be brief on those 2. So I think just to clarify on the first part of the question, I was describing the majority of our digital business today. So think about pickup through the stores, think about the work that we're doing in delivery to customers today. And when we share that doubling our digital profitability, that was based on those metrics. And so how do we improve the cost to serve, how do we improve digital media revenue. On the customer fulfillment centers, we're very much in the middle of that journey right now of sort of 18 months or so into those first 2 facilities, really kind of fully understanding the scale of demand to how the customers behave and how you optimize that model. So I'd say more to come on that as we continue to understand that sort of key phase of those first 2 facilities really seeing the progress there on profitability. But from a customer demand, the customer experience, we're seeing all the sort of things we have hoped to have seen around customer engagement. W. McMullen: And we are actively looking for sites for some preannounced locations too on those and finding the sites ended up being a little bit more difficult than what we would have expected. Gary Millerchip : And I think just very brief on your second question, Michael. But for us, it's about maintaining flexibility. We believe we built our model to be able to adapt and to deliver value for our customers. We gave directional numbers just because I think it's helpful on inflation because of the LIFO calculation. But our expectation is our goal will be to continue to deliver more value for customers and over time grow our share and obviously make sure we meet the customer where they are and we expect the second half of the year to have some -- definitely some things that we don't know how to perfectly plan for. We need to make sure we're nimble and agile to be adapt to that because there's clearly going to be changed in the second half of the year. W. McMullen: And we feel good about our overall model being able to adapt in any situation in any market because we give a great value for the customer regardless. Thanks for the question, Michael. Operator : Our next question comes from Kenneth Goldman of JPMorgan. Kenneth Goldman : You mentioned that one of the reasons why working capital was higher than usual in the fourth quarter is that you were buying a little bit ahead to protect margins, I assume as inflation rises. Two underlying questions here. First, was this mainly in the grocery department. You talked about grocery being particularly tough in terms of inflation. And then maybe more importantly, I'm just curious, is there going to be an offset to this in the first quarter, maybe as you run through that higher-than-usual inventory, I guess I'm really just trying to ascertain if you're going to buy less than usual from some of your grocery vendors next quarter or this quarter. Gary Millerchip : Yes. Thanks for the question, Ken. From our perspective, the main forward buying would be in pharmacy and some in grocery, that will be the 2 key areas that we looked at and felt there was a good opportunity to protect margins, as I mentioned in the prepared comments. From our perspective on working capital, certainly, some of the year-over-year variance would be things that we would expect to maintain because we are seeing continued higher inflation on inventory. And as we called out, we're expecting as we improve in-stock levels as we have that some of that will be sticky. We would look at some of the payables and receivables timing impact and would expect that to be coming back. In fact, if we look at our cash at the end of the first period, the first month of the new year, it was actually up by $1 billion and back in line with the prior year, which obviously wasn't the case at the year-end. So we do think some of it was timing and will flow through. But obviously, we have strong plans for the year in terms of continuing to grow with our partners. And I would focus more on -- from our perspective, how we make sure we're continuing to drive free cash flow, and we feel good about our ability to do that. W. McMullen: And the forward buying is really driven by the economics at any given day in terms of what's available in the marketplace. If it's a good return, we'll invest the money there. If the return is not good, then you'll see the flow of benefiting working capital. Gary Millerchip : We didn't give exact numbers. I would also say, Ken, the forward buying would be a smaller part of the number, the timing of payments would be a bigger part of that than the actual forward buying. Kenneth Goldman : Got it. And then a quick follow-up.  Implied operating cash flow. It's one of the questions I'm getting from investors. You gave a CapEx number, so we can back into it, obviously. Just curious why given the strong EBIT growth this year, given some of the working capital reversals, why would it not be a little bit better than what guidance is suggesting. I know you talked a little bit about this. I just wanted to get a little bit more detail on some of the underlying factors there if possible. Gary Millerchip : Yes. I think I would say we try to guide to what we think is a more normalized year in 2023, Ken. Part of it, I would say we probably are being a little bit conservative because of -- we want to see how this unwind of COVID exactly plays out. A couple of examples would be if inflation does remain at high levels, obviously, that could impact inventory but also as we kind of unwind accruals on things like incentive payments, assuming we're more going to be more like an on-target incentive payment than significantly higher than on-target payout, those things can create some 1-year adjustments, too. So there's a few areas that just kind of create a few wrinkles. And candidly, we're trying to be conservative to make sure we can see the flow-through of the catch-up from 2022 as well. So we feel we tried -- what we tried to do is take a conservative view of a normalized environment, but there is still some, I would say, unwinding that we wanted to make sure we understood as we reported out in 2023. W. McMullen: And our incentive plan is designed -- our long-term incentive plan is designed such that we are incentivized to do better than the guidance we've given. Gary Millerchip : Yes, I think it'd be fair to say our internal goal would be higher than what we shared because we do believe it's one opportunity, but we thought it was appropriate to be conservative in the circumstances. Operator : Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : Also congrats on a great quarter. So I just want to touch on market share. Just curious if you look at  Kroger's performance in Q4, I'm not even sure if you have the full year data, just curious how your market share is performing versus your expectations? Because if I recall last quarter, you were starting to see improvement in the market share. W. McMullen: Yes. We're continuing to see improvement and if you look at internally, if you were at one of our meetings, you'd hear us continually focus on how to even continue to improve. Our objective and expectations of ourselves is to grow market share. And if you look at the higher-income shopper, in those customer segments, we did a great job gaining share in Fresh. We're doing a good job of gaining share. And I would say we're pleased with the progress, but we still are not satisfied. Rupesh Parikh : Okay. Great. And then maybe just one quick follow-up question. Just quarter-to-date. Any color you can provide in terms of what you're seeing just throughout the quarter? W. McMullen: Yes. As you know, we always get it. We always provide some insight. If you look so far, we're consistent with our expectations and Gary outlined a little bit about what we would expect quarterly between quarters to be. If you look at the first period, the first 4 weeks of the year, it's trending a little bit better than [indiscernible] but both of those were lower than the fourth quarter actual. And I want to remind you that ESI -- Express Scripts, I should say, is about 1.5%. And then I always hate to talk about weather, but weather was more friendly to us a year ago than it is this year and I don't ever want to use weather as an excuse, but it is an insight if you look at the current trends,  but the key point is we are trending where we expect it to be. Operator : Our next question comes from Spencer Hanus from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Spencer Hanus : On Our Brands, you saw that outperform the overall comp again this quarter. Are you seeing CPGs get more willing to offer trade spend just given the share losses that they're seeing? And do you think the trade down that we've seen over the last few quarters accelerate as we move through '23? W. McMullen: Yes. If you look at a 5-year trend or a 10-year trend, Our Brands has picked up share on almost every year. And the only exception to that was a little bit of time during COVID where people had much more money in their pocket. If you look, I would say, all short statements and economics are wrong, but we still have several CPGs that are passed or trying to pass through costs more than probably their inflation. We would still see that they're more focused on profit and tonnage. And when that is true, that's when Our Brand continues to gain share. And that's the reason why Our Brand is performing so strongly. And if you look at historical cycles, eventually, that what you outlined will happen, but it hasn't started happening yet. Spencer Hanus : Got it. That's helpful. And then on fuel margins, you called out $0.51 during the prepared remarks, which is up more than 50% versus what it was in 2019. So  just curious how you're thinking about the sustainability of fuel margins and where those will ultimately be baseline as it just becomes a bigger part of your overall operating profit today? Gary Millerchip : Yes. Thanks, Spencer. So I think as we mentioned in our prepared comments, we do believe that fuel margins will be sustained at a higher level than the historical averages. We think there's been some structural changes in that industry as you look at the last 5 years that would cause us to think that margins will be maintained at a higher level than historical levels. All that being said though, we do think -- I think I mentioned it in one of the questions earlier that we would think that fuel profitability somewhere between $200 million to $250 million headwind in 2023, largely not because we don't think that there's a continued sort of sustainability in fuel margins. But if you remember last year, when the war in Ukraine was announced, there were some real volatility in prices. And we think some of those shocks that happened around those times generally don't get repeated and cycle. So it's really allowing some of those sort of onetime unusual spikes in pricing or changes in pricing. But fundamentally, we believe fuel will be sustained at high levels. W. McMullen: The other thing just to add to Gary's point. When retail fuel prices are high, customers engage in our fuel rewards a lot more and we provide significant discounts to customers through our fuel rewards. If prices come down, usually our reward costs will go down there as well. So you have to look at all the pieces together. Operator : Our next question comes from Kate McShane of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Leah Jordan : This is Leah Jordan. You called out sourcing again as a tailwind this quarter. How are you managing that differently today? How much of an opportunity do you still see there? And is there anything assumed within the cost savings guidance as well? W. McMullen: I'll let Gary get into the details. But in sourcing, it's an area where several years ago, we really didn't have a separate department and didn't have professionals that manage that organization. And a couple of leaders and now reports to Gary, they've done a great job of finding talent that understands how to source product, understands the cost of the ingredients and all the pieces. And it's really turned it into a professional organization, and it's under the leadership of Mike Donnelly and Erin Sharp and a few people that have retired and now it's under Gary's leadership. And I just think that team has done a great job of bringing professionalism to the area. In terms of the specifics, now I'll let Gary get into the details. Gary Millerchip : Sure. Thanks, Rodney. Thanks for the question, [ Kate ]. Yes, we certainly believe that we -- it's a bit like our overall approach to taking cost out of the business. We started out saying, how do we make sure we're as efficient as we can be and then really become, I think, part of the culture and part of the capability in the organization and the team is working together, I'd say it's across merchandising, operations, supply chain and sourcing, all kind of collaborating on how do we design for value. So whether that be, as Rodney mentioned, continuing to make sure we understand the cost that makes the product and build the product and get the product to our stores in a way that we're able to make sure we're being dynamic in negotiating and managing those costs effectively where they change, but it's also about optimizing product design. It's looking at product end-to-end and improving, whether it's packaging or product design and optimizing with customer demand alongside how we can then really match the customer expectations with how we're actually designing the products to really drive the maximum value. And I'd say a bit like the productivity savings, one of those things where every year, we see a road map to additional savings, additional opportunities. And I think that will continue to be the case based on our experience so far. Leah Jordan : Great. And I have one quick follow-up on SNAP. Just giving any -- the potential changes there. How did you think about that with your guidance. And also, given you have such a diverse footprint, is there any color you could provide on the stores where states they've already had that extra allotment roll off? W. McMullen: If you look at SNAP, we've assumed that it's a meaningful headwind for the balance of the year. We're hopeful that everybody will work together to continue or find additional money because, as you know, because of inflation, there's a lot of people whose budget is under strain, but we have assumed that, that was a meaningful headwind both in the quarter and for the balance of the year. I don't know, Gary, anything you want to add? Gary Millerchip : No, I think it ties to the point about there is still uncertainty, so we're making sure that we're allowing for that in our guidance for the year. I would say historically, and you probably or say this before that it's actually very difficult to find a correlation between SNAP in the market and spend on food at home because typically, it tends to impact more discretionary spend. But I think our view was that we've never really had a point in time where we've had so much SNAP dollars in the market. So we believe most of the models that we've looked at for the last 30 years are kind of difficult to say, well, they hold true in this environment. So we felt it was important to be conservative given that we are in a unique time. Operator : Our final question for today comes from Kelly Bania from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Kelly Bania : Rodney and Gary. I wanted to ask just about what your guidance assumes regarding the broader promotional environment. And I guess particularly thinking about the back half when maybe inflation is at a little bit of a lower level, do you expect competition and promotional activity to heat up? This seems to be one of the key investor concerns as we head into next year. Gary Millerchip : Yes. Thanks for the question, Kelly. I think from our perspective, we feel that we have to be agile, and we're certainly shooting in our guidance that we'll be continuing to invest in value for the customer. I think one of the things that we believe has changed somewhat during the COVID environment is the situation of how the customer shops and engages with you is different. And what I mean by that is many more customers are engaged digitally, which gives us the ability to truly be able to personalize and bring together all the different pieces. So it's less about just what you see when you enter the store, it's about the fuel rewards that we can target for that customer. It's the personalized digital coupons. It's the Our Brands offers that, as Rodney mentioned earlier, can save the customer 10% on an equivalent basket if they decide to shift to some of those products. So we believe we've learned a lot through the pandemic of how do you really channel those dollars in the most effective way, and that's what gives us the confidence that as we think about the rest of the year. We'll continue to invest in value for the customer, but that we can do that even more effectively than the past to make sure that we stretch those dollars further to deliver value for our customers. W. McMullen: And one of the things that I think is always important to make sure a lot customers also decide where to shop based on how the freshness of product and the friendliness of associates, and that's part of the overall value equation. So when you look at how we go to market, we have personalized offers, we have promotions, we have fuel rewards. And the customer will engage in those to manage their budget and then they win by having incredibly fresh product and incredibly friendly associates. And that's how somebody decides where to shop. So I really think it's important for you to look at all those together. Kelly Bania : Okay. Great. And just to follow up on the discussion of units and inflation. I think as we look at this year comps, 5% to 6% range with inflation, I believe, in the double-digit range. So maybe would imply units or tonnage down high single digit. And for next year, 2.5% to 3.5% maybe seems to assume a pretty meaningful acceleration in units. So just maybe correct me where I'm wrong on that math? Or just help us understand what would maybe drive a better unit or tonnage backdrop for Kroger in '23? W. McMullen: The unit change wouldn't be as much as you said because remember also, people are switching to Our Brands and other things, where the ring per item is less, but we sell more units. So when you look at overall, and if you look overall, we also look at share and if when you look at units in total, they're declining as well. So we would expect to continue to make progress in improving our share and the flow-through of units would come from that. I don't know, Gary, anything... Gary Millerchip : No... W. McMullen: Thanks, Kelly, for the question. With that, obviously, thanks to everyone for all your questions. And as always, before we close, I'd like to share a few comments directly with our associates listening in. We invite our associates to come to Kroger for a job and discover a career. And I can't think of a better example of this than an associate at our Cincinnati, Dayton division, [indiscernible] came to the United States from Togo. After a few weeks as a bagger, his store manager, Brian asked him if he'd be interested in leading the dairy department in his store. Because of the dedication, determination and great job that he's done, [indiscernible] is now the center store specialist, and I can't wait to see what's next for this amazing young man. I'm inspired every day by the amazing work each of you do and could not be more humbled to be part of this world-class team as we enter the next year. Thank you for making Kroger the incredible place that it is. Thank you, everyone, for joining us. That concludes today's call. Operator : Thank you for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

[Operator Instructions] Please note that this event is being recorded. I would like now to turn the conference call over to Rob Quast, Senior Director, Investor Relations to begin. Please go ahead. Rob Quast : Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's first quarter 2024 earnings call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen; and Interim Chief Financial Officer, Todd Foley. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger company assumes no obligation to update that information. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question if necessary. I will now turn the call over to Rodney. Rodney McMullen : Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we begin, I'd like to provide an outline of our discussion topics this morning. I will start by sharing a recap of our first quarter performance and highlight how we continue to advance our go-to-market strategy, which powers our value creation model and drives long-term sustainable growth for our shareholders. Then Todd will cover our financial results for the first quarter. Finally, I will provide a few comments on our proposed merger with Albertsons before we open it up for questions. We're off to a solid start in 2024, reflecting the strength and diversity of our model. As better than expected performance from our Grocery business helped us manage Fuel and Health & Wellness results that were behind expectations, Kroger is providing exceptional value and a unique omnichannel experience, which combined with strong store execution, led to growth in households and an increase in customer visits. As inflation moderates, we expect customer sentiment to continue improving. But near term, many customers are managing economic uncertainty. While we expect Health & Wellness profitability pressures to continue into the second quarter, our recent improvement on store execution metrics and strong customer trends give us confidence that we are building momentum for a strong back half of the year and we are well-positioned to deliver on our full-year guidance. As we've seen over recent quarters, customers continue to seek value and are shopping with us differently based on their financial situations. Spending from premium and mainstream customers continue to be strong. Mainstream households drove our overall household growth and we improved our share of wallet with premium customers who are deepening their loyalty, spending more in our fresh departments and enjoying more premium products such as Private Selection. Within our most budget-conscious households, we are starting to see positive momentum and we grew households in this segment after experiencing declines last year. Historic multi-year inflation across the economy, high interest rates and reduced government benefits disproportionately affect these customers and are influencing their spending behaviors. Kroger's longstanding commitment to low prices and personalized promotions creates real value for our customers at a time when many of them need it more than ever. Food-at-home continues to be the most affordable meal option for customers while food inflation has impacted every meal occasion, inflation in food-away-from-home has been even higher than food-at-home inflation since 2019. We are committed to making sure our customers can enjoy a great meal experience with zero compromise on quality, selection, value and convenience. We see a significant growth opportunity to deliver convenient restaurant quality meals at an attractive value and we are expanding our Ready To Heat and Ready To Eat offerings. For example, after we revamped our fried chicken recipe, we created a meal bundle which feeds a family for $3.50 a person, a fraction of what it would cost to eat out at restaurants with quality that's difficult to beat. Every day we strive to provide an outstanding customer experience and we are focused on sharpening our store execution to do just that. This year, we raised the bar on our full, fresh and friendly customer experience metrics and we are very proud of our store teams who are delivering an even better shopping experience with service metrics at record highs. To continue the momentum in our Grocery business, we are committed to keeping prices low for customers and delivering a consistent experience while growing our pillars of Fresh, Our Brands, Seamless and Personalization. Leading with Fresh, our store team's primary goal this year is to drive more consistent shopping experience and that begins with Fresh. We are introducing new technology that's enabling our teams to better track [Technical Difficulty] Operator : We have lost connection with today's speaker. Please stand by while we still try to reconnect with them. Thank you for your patience, everyone. We now have the speaker back on the line. Please continue. Rodney McMullen : Our ongoing work to differentiate and elevate our brands is driving higher profitability. We are identifying new supply sources using more effective promotions and improving product mix, which is contributing to further margin improvements. Now to Seamless. Delivery solutions led digital results again this quarter with an increase in both households and visits. Pickup also had solid growth and focus on delivering best-in-class fulfillment led to strong improvements in key customer experience metrics. This quarter, our teams improved fill rates to a new record high, reduced wait time and delivered a significant improvement in perfect orders compared to last year. Through the power of machine learning and AI, we are developing new ways to elevate the Pickup experience for customers and at the same time reduce costs. With dynamic batching of orders, these tools are providing associates the most effective pick routes, which is enabling us to dramatically reduce pick lead time in our highest volume stores. Our customers love the Kroger delivery experience with refrigerated products delivered directly to their doorstep. As a result, the Kroger delivery network has experienced remarkable growth with sales nearly doubling this quarter versus last year. As we focus on providing an incredible customer experience, we are learning and adjusting the delivery network. A good example of this is our decision in the first quarter to close three spoke locations to reallocate capacity closer to our automated fulfillment centers where we have higher customer density and better order level profitability. This decision does not impact Kroger's automated FCs or other spoke locations. We remain confident that our Kroger delivery network provides a differentiated customer experience and will continue to be a key pillar of our digital growth strategy. Turning to Personalization. The combination of seamless and our personalization capabilities generated another quarter of digital engagement growth, up 9% compared to the same quarter last year. Personalization enables us to balance the depth and breadth of our promotions more effectively and encourages customers to engage more with us by focusing on promotions that matter most to them. This led to an 18% increase in digital coupon clips compared to last year. Capturing more digital households is a key to our long-term growth model as these households are more loyal, spend nearly three times as much with us and drive our alternative profit businesses. By executing our go-to-market strategy, we create momentum in our Grocery business. In turn, this creates the data and traffic to accelerate growth in areas like Health & Wellness and our Alternative Profit businesses. Alternative Profit businesses had a strong quarter led by growth in Kroger Precision Marketing. KPM results were in-line with what we expected and keep us on track to meet our full-year expectations of more than 20% media growth. Yesterday, KPM continued to broaden its reach by offering its custom audiences and ad measurement capabilities to advertisers on the Meta social media platforms. This is another important step in KPM's growth, creating more opportunities for clients to reach relevant audiences in more places and providing better transparency to add effectiveness. Health & Wellness grew its top line this quarter. However, profitability results were below expectations. We are optimistic about the potential of this area of our business. Our script adherence initiatives are on track and our teams are providing excellent care which helps patients live healthier lives. Additionally, our marketing plans and in-store activations designed to raise awareness and attract new patients are launching now to help drive growth in the back half of the year. Turning now to associates. Our associates are doing an excellent job elevating the customer experience and improving our full, fresh and friendly metrics this quarter. Team consistency leads to better execution and retention improved again this quarter. We are retaining more associates through a holistic approach which includes wage and benefit investments and also a focus on associates well-being and this work is being recognized. This quarter, Kroger received the 2024 Platinum Bell Seal for Workplace Mental Health. This is the third consecutive year that we've been recognized with the certification. And for the first time we received the top distinction. This program recognized Kroger as an employer who creates a mentally healthy workplace for our associates through culture, benefits, compliance and wellness programs. We'll continue to invest in our associates. When our associates have a better experience, they provide a better experience to our customers. With that, I'll turn it over to Todd to take you through our first quarter financial results. Todd? Todd Foley : Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger's first quarter performance reflects the resiliency of our model, which enables us to manage a variety of economic cycles. The strength of our model combined with the momentum in our Grocery business gives us confidence to reaffirm our full year guidance even as we continue to navigate an environment of economic uncertainty. I'll now take you through our first quarter financial results. We achieved identical sales without fuel growth of 0.5%. As Rodney mentioned earlier, our identical sales were driven by several positive customer metric trends, including increases in total and loyal households and increased customer visits. We continue to see sequential unit improvement and our teams remain focused on returning to positive units later this year. Inflation continues to moderate, which is consistent with our expectations at the start of the year, and towards the end of the first quarter, we began cycling the headwinds from the reduction in SNAP benefits. Digital sales grew by more than 8%, which was led by 17% growth in delivery solutions. Gross margin was 22.4% of sales and our FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, decreased seven basis points. The decrease in rate was primarily attributable to lower pharmacy margins and increased price investments partially offset by favorable product mix reflecting Our Brands' margin performance. The slight decline in our FIFO gross margin rate was in line with our expectations. We expect our FIFO gross margin rate to improve beyond our first quarter result driven by the core components of our margin expansion initiatives. During the first quarter, we recorded a LIFO charge of $41 million compared to a charge of $99 million for the same quarter last year. The decreased charge for the quarter was due to lower inflation expectations for the current year compared to last year. The OG&A rate excluding fuel and adjustment items increased 22 basis points, driven by planned investments in associate wages and increased incentive plan costs partially offset by continued execution of cost savings initiatives. In the second quarter, we expect the factors identified in the first quarter to continue, leading to a similar to slightly higher OG&A rate. We expect our OG&A rate to improve in the second half of 2024. We continue to make progress on our digital profitability, delivering another quarter of improvement in our pickup cost to serve. It remains a long-term margin opportunity with runway to improve through increased volume and process enhancements. Our store associates played a key role in the cost to serve improvements and, as Rodney mentioned earlier, did so while they improved key customer experience metrics. Adjusted FIFO operating profit was $1.499 billion. Our adjusted EPS was $1.43 per diluted share, a decline of $0.05 compared to last year. Fuel continues to be a key driver of our strategy to build loyalty by providing compelling fuel rewards to customers. We continue to see more reward activity with 8% more redemptions contributing to gallon sales, which outpaced the industry this quarter. However, our fuel profitability was below expectations this quarter with our cents per gallon fuel margin down low single-digits compared to last year. I'd now like to provide a brief update on associates and labor relations. We continue to invest in our associates as part of our long-term strategy, resulting in an average hourly rate of $19 an hour and a rate of nearly $25, with comprehensive benefits factored in. During the first quarter, we ratified new labor agreements for our Houston Clerks and Meat, Mid-Atlantic Division stores in West Virginia, South Carolina stores in Columbia and Myrtle Beach and Portland Distribution Center and Drivers covering more than 21,000 associates. Turning to cash flow. Kroger continues to generate adjusted free cash flow, strong adjusted free cash flow, through consistent operating results which is enabling us to continue deleveraging in anticipation of our merger with Albertsons. At the end of the quarter, Kroger's net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.25 compared to our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Our strengthened balance sheet provides ample opportunities for Kroger to pursue growth and enhance shareholder value. We continue to take a disciplined approach to deploying capital with a focus on projects which drive long-term sustainable net earnings growth while remaining committed to our investment grade debt rating, increasing our dividend over time subject to board approval and returning excess capital to shareholders when we are able to do so. As part of our capital investment plans for 2024, we shared last quarter our plans for approximately 30 major storing projects focused on higher growth geographies, where we have traditionally achieved a strong ROIC and operating profit growth. We've made good progress on our projects so far and remain on track with our plans. While early, we're happy with the results from projects completed in the first quarter. We are confident these new storing projects will help advance our omnichannel strategy and be an important component to our sales growth and TSR model going forward. During the first quarter, we announced we had entered an agreement for the sale of our Kroger Specialty Pharmacy business. As part of our regular and ongoing review of our portfolio, we determined that Specialty Pharmacy was not part of our core strategy going forward and a sale would enable us to focus on our Health & Wellness strategies that revolve around our retail pharmacies. Due to the sale, a non-recurring held for sale tax adjustment of $31 million was recognized in the quarter and it has been reflected as an adjustment item in our results. The sale of KSP is not expected to have an impact on our 2024 guidance. I'd now like to provide some additional color on our outlook for the rest of the year. Today, we reaffirmed our annual guidance reflecting both positive momentum we are seeing in our business along with a more cautious customer environment in the near term. In terms of quarterly cadence, we now expect a decline in adjusted EPS for the second quarter similar to the rate we observed in the first quarter as we expect pharmacy business profitability pressures to carry over into the second quarter. This reaffirms where we expected to be through both the first half of the year as well as the full fiscal 2024. In closing, our first quarter performance reflects the strength and resiliency of our model. We are strengthening our Grocery business, which drives the data and traffic to accelerate growth in our Alternative Profit businesses and we remain confident in our ability to drive attractive and sustainable returns for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call back to Rodney. Rodney McMullen : Thanks, Todd. As you've heard from both of us, our Grocery business is performing well and we are building momentum across our business. Kroger is operating from a position of strength. We have the right strategy, which is resonating with customers, and we have the financial strength to pursue growth and enhance shareholder value. As we continue to prepare for our merger with Albertsons, I'd like to thank our associates for their incredible commitment. Since we announced the proposed merger back in October of 2022, our associates have done an exceptional job preparing for the integration with Albertsons while never once taking their eye off the ball of serving our customers, advancing our strategy, operating our business and driving results. Because of their efforts, we will be prepared to hit the ground running as a combined company ready to serve more customers from day one. A more general merger update, in April, we announced an expanded divestiture plan with C&S, which directly responds to the concerns raised by federal and state antitrust regulators regarding the original agreement. We believe the package, which includes a modified and expanded store set and more non-store assets, bolsters Kroger's position and regulatory challenges to the proposed merger. Including our upcoming court proceedings, it also positions C&S to be a strong and successful competitor. We are prepared to defend our merger because it will produce meaningful and measurable benefits for customers, for associates and for communities across the country. Customers will benefit from lower prices and more choices following the merger close. We have committed to investing $500 million to begin lowering prices day one following close, along with an additional $1.3 billion to improve Albertsons stores. Employees will benefit from Kroger's commitment to invest $1 billion to raise wages and comprehensive benefits, further building on our $2.4 billion and incremental investments since 2018. As union membership continues to decline nationwide, this merger will secure union jobs. And communities will benefit from the strength and the ability of the combined company to accelerate Kroger's commitment to ending hunger. As a combined company, Kroger has committed to donating 10 billion meals to families across the US by 2030. In closing, Kroger is off to a solid start to the year, positioning us well to deliver on our commitments. We continue to invest in associates and the associate experience because when they have a better experience, our customers do as well. Grocery results are off to a better-than-expected start, which provides the foundation for growth in Alternative Profit businesses and our model is generating strong free cash flow, which has strengthened our balance sheet and positions us for future growth. With that Todd and I look forward to taking your questions. Because we are in litigation, we will not be taking questions on the merger this morning. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Rupesh Parikh : Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Rodney McMullen : Good morning. Rupesh Parikh : So I wanted to dig deeper into the gross margin line, if you can maybe walk us through the puts and takes as you guys see it for the balance of the year, including how you think about the pharmacy margins in the back half of the year. Todd Foley : Yeah, thanks, Rupesh. Great question. We talked at the beginning of the year that our expectation was to have relatively flat year-over-year gross margin and that is still the expectation. As mentioned in my comments, we do expect results for the balance of the year to improve beyond our Q1 results and that's really reflective of some of the gross margin expansion efforts that we have going on. They're going actually really well. We alluded to our Our Brands performance. Our margins in Our Brands continue to do very well and as that business continues to grow, particularly in today's environment, we talked about the budget-conscious consumer and that continues to connect with them. And so the growth in that business helps drive the margins and we expect to see that as the year goes on. Fresh is another category where we've had meaningful growth. Fresh is doing really well. We've talked a lot about produce, our end-to-end Fresh and how that business is growing. And certainly that comes with higher margins, which has a positive effect on our mix. And then when you look at Alternative Profits and in particular retail media, that business continues to grow well and especially the second half of the year. We expect retail media to continue its momentum to achieve our growth of excess of 20% for the year. A lot going on in that space. And we went to a new platform a year ago and as we went and ramped up the platform a year ago, we'll be cycling that period of time with some of the momentum we have in that business. So all of those are where a lot of our confidence comes from when we talk about reaffirming our guidance for the year. And we alluded to some of the pharmacy headwinds. Even though we expect some of those to carry over into the second quarter, I think all of the results that we're seeing from our margin expansion efforts are going to continue to drive us so that we hit our expectations to improve the result relative to Q1. Rodney McMullen : I want to just add a couple of points on Todd's last point. We continue to have good success with value-add product and typically that product is something that the customer can eat almost immediately in the car or at home, and that's helping on margin. And then our sourcing teams continue to have making progress in cost of goods, which helps as well. Rupesh Parikh : Great. And then maybe just one quick follow-up question. In light of some of the competitor announcements of reducing price on certain items, just wondering how you guys feel about your price gaps today. Rodney McMullen : If you look at overall, as you know, for the last, I don't know, 15, 18 years, part of the Kroger's strategy has always been to invest in pricing every year and 2024 wouldn't have been any different than any of the previous years. And we continue to execute against that plan of helping the customer stretch their budget. If you look at where we feel on our relative price position, we feel very good. And one of the things that we even -- was glad to see is if you look at the customer that's on a budget, for the first time in over a year, we actually had growth in count from that customer base. So overall, we feel good about where we are. One of the things I always think it's important to remember too is, as a promotional merchant, people buy a lot more when things are in promotion. We also have a very sophisticated rewards program for personalized offers that publicly you wouldn't see and also our fuel rewards. So overall, we feel good about where we are and we feel good about where we are relative to any of our competitors. Thanks, Rupesh. Rupesh Parikh : Great, thank you. I'll pass it along. Operator : The next question comes from Robert F. Ohmes from Bank of America Meryll Lynch. Robert Ohmes : Oh, hey, Rodney. I had just two follow-ups on the first question. Hey, just in terms of the price investments, and I know you guys always do them, but has anything changed with what your CPG partners are doing with Kroger to drive volumes? Because we know that they're looking to do that. And then also would love to just get further perspective on what Kroger is seeing competitively either the same or different sort of there's kind of Walmart and Target, but what are the regionals and independents doing competitively? Are they changing at all? What they're doing? Rodney McMullen : If you look at CPG partners, overall, we would be seeing more trade dollars than in the past, and I think some of that ties to the comment I made before on sourcing. As economists always say, all short statements are incorrect. There are some CPG partners that aren't worried as much about tonnage and wouldn't be as aggressive. But we are seeing an increased trend where CPG most CPG partners are starting to focus on tonnage again and then trying to partner with us more aggressively to help tonnage. If you look at regional competitors, really wouldn't see much difference there than the national competitors. And overall inflation is up slightly. You would see people raising slightly more prices than lowering. But nothing that's especially different there than what we would see. And as you know, there's a ton of great awesome regional competitors out there. Thanks, Robby. Operator : The next question comes from Simeon Gutman from Morgan Stanley. Uriel Zachary Abraham : Hi. This is Zach on for Simeon. Thanks for taking our questions. First, with respect to the Q1 performance, would you say that you set up the guidance with some conservatism or was it genuinely stronger than what you thought it would look like? And maybe as a follow-up, why shouldn't we extrapolate that level of upside for the full year? And was it driven primarily by price or units or some of both? Thank you. Rodney McMullen : Yeah, if you look at the first quarter performance, as Todd and I both mentioned, we felt very good about where we were finished or where it turned out. One of the things I always think it's, the first quarter is so early in the year, I never felt -- it would be unusual for us to feel comfortable changing too much. If you look at things that we felt good about or the things that we outlined in the prepared comments around our customer count growth, the growth that's broad-based across all of our customer types, our store team is doing a very good job of continuing to improve the experience and in-stock positions and all those things. The couple of headwinds that we do have is if you look at like incentive plans, especially in the second quarter, we'll have significantly higher incentive plan accruals in the second quarter than what we did a year ago, which is partially what's affecting the second quarter. But overall, for the year, we feel good about where we are. We feel good about where we are relative to where we thought we would be. But it's really too early in the year to make too many changes. Todd Foley : That's a good call, Rodney. And actually the two go together. The strength we saw in the first half of the business is really tied to your incentive plan comment. A big contributor to the strength we're seeing in our Grocery business is around our teams delivering on store execution and the shopping experience and improvement in those metrics is an important part of our incentive plan this year. So it's -- those two thoughts are connected with one another. Uriel Zachary Abraham : Okay. Rodney McMullen : Thanks, Zach. Operator : The next question comes from Kenneth B. Goldman from JPMorgan. Kenneth Goldman : Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to clarify, are you still on track to see inflation increase as the year progresses? I think that was mentioned in the last quarter. I didn't hear any update on that rate of change. And then I don't think you provided, again, I may have missed it, gross profit dollars or pennies per gallon for fuel. Just trying to follow up on those two. Rodney McMullen : Yeah, I'll let Todd answer the second part. On inflation for the year, the first quarter was pretty much where we expected it to be. Where we, for the year, it's pretty consistent with where we thought it would be. So if I'm going off of memory, but I think we said it was slightly over 1% and we would continue to see it slightly over 1%. It's -- if you look at some of the commodity -- the commodities themselves, obviously that will bounce up and down. And as you get later in the year, we -- that some of that bounce will be driven by what kind of crop year is it relative to corn and some of those things. But really overall, what we expect inflation to be similar to where we did last year and it is starting to stabilize. We don't see deflation broad-based at all, but it is stabilizing around that little over 1%. Todd Foley : Yeah, that's great. And on the fuel point, we did -- in my comments that we did see that cents per gallon margin was down low single digits. Rodney McMullen : Okay. Thanks, Ken. Operator : The next question comes from John Heinbockel from Guggenheim Partners. John Heinbockel : Hey, Rodney, I wanted to start with, when you think about delivery and pickup profitability, I mean, I know you're losing money in those areas. Do you have an idea in mind when you can begin to approach breakeven? I know it's going to take a while, but thought on that. And then if you had to pick a couple of key drivers, right, that would get you there, what do you think they are? Rodney McMullen : Yeah, if you look, and John, we've talked about it a lot of times, I always say our job one is to make sure we don't lose the customer and job two is we have the responsibility to figure out how to be profitable with each of those customers. We do have some divisions that are now at breakeven or slightly profitable. And if you look at incrementally on a per order basis, through almost all of our channels, now they're -- incrementally they're contributing. In terms of our expectation of ourself is that, that customer will be just as profitable as a store customer over time. I don't know that I would put a specific date on it yet, but that is the expectations we have for ourselves. And the key things on it will be continuing, for me, I think number one is making sure our NPS scores stay strong because that's what causes that customer to continue to repeat. Then making sure that each basket we start getting where the customer adds items within a basket and then always from an operating cost standpoint, we'll continue to use our technology to be more efficient. John Heinbockel : Okay. Then maybe as a follow-up on pharmacy. So what's your sense -- the pressure is coming from where? Is it solely reimbursement or something else? I mean what's your take on reimbursement longer term and are we basically going to see less capacity, right? Drugstores, right, are closing a lot of locations. But do you think between that, supermarkets getting out of the business, there will be a lot less capacity in Pharmacy three years or four years or five years from now that will help profitability? Todd Foley : John, I'll talk to the headwinds a little bit. What we're seeing there was really a couple of items in product mix. One was around GLP-1. We've talked about that before. It's a high retail ring, but an extremely low margin and so that puts pressure on our margins. And coming into the year, if you recall the latter part of last year, we had supply constraints on GLP-1. And so some of those restraints were relieved in the first quarter. And frankly, our team did a really nice job with suppliers getting out there to get product to meet demand in our stores. And so our sales exceeded what we expected to see in the first quarter and that put a little bit of that unexpected pressure on margins. And then the second, there's another category of drugs as well, where we saw some regulatory restrictions that were unexpected that drove up the cost on those meds and put some pressure on the margin. So when we talked about some unexpected trends in Pharmacy, it was really around product mix in those couple of areas, and wanted to make sure we called it out, because we do see that carrying over into the second part of the year, it wasn't necessarily reimbursement related. Rodney McMullen : And as we look longer term, three years or five years, we definitely think there'll be less capacity. And as you noted, there's a significant number of closures by the other three players in that space. And there's a lot of work that's being done from a governmental standpoint around PBMs. The thing that I get super excited about, our pharmacies and our Health & Wellness teams, they continue to do a great job of improving the experience. And I think it's amazing that a third of our customers don't even realize we have a pharmacy. And we're obviously working incredibly hard to make sure that third of our customers that don't even realize we have a custom that we have a pharmacy to get them to convert and become a patient of our pharmacy because our teams do an amazing job on service. We have incredibly quick lines and things like that and it's one less trip that somebody has to make. So thanks, John, for the question. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Lasser from UBS. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. Rodney McMullen : Good morning. Michael Lasser : Rodney, between some of the comments from other food -- morning -- before -- between some of the comments from other food retailers, as well as your own discussion around increased price investments, there is a perception that the industry is becoming more competitive and that is going to disrupt the profitability of food retail in the back half of the year. So could you compare where the overall promotional intensity that you're witnessing is today versus where it's been in the past, especially around disruptive times? And how much did your price investment contribute to the improvement that you saw in more price-sensitive customers, lower income consumers, in the quarter? Rodney McMullen : In terms of overall, I would say, in terms of promotional activity looks very similar to pre-COVID and for the first time it finally starts looking and feeling more like pre-COVID times. As I mentioned a second ago, overall, we saw more prices go up than go down, when you look at the individual number of SKUs. I feel really good about where we are and I feel good about our teams and their ability to continue taking care of customers. In terms of the valued customer, I think, a lot of it is driven more from some of the things that we've done relative to our new brand in terms of Smart Way, helping that customer understand that they can come and shop with us and it's -- and you don't have to compromise relative to fresh and quality and some of those other aspects and experience -- the customer experience or associate experience that they give. So when you look at it overall, it's pretty consistent with where we thought it would be. And part of it, I think, is just the moderating inflation, but we still continue to expect a little bit of inflation. Michael Lasser : My follow-up question is that Kroger's financial formula works very well when its ID sales are above 3%. When is a realistic expectation that it could resume seeing ID sales back at that level? Todd Foley : I think you're right. Our model is to drive 2% to 4% ID sales. And as you looked at -- we talked a lot last quarter around the dynamics of inflation and what we saw last year with the rapid disinflation throughout the year. And as we get back to this year, that more normal inflation environment that Rodney alluded to, and we start cycling those heavy disinflations. We talk about the -- getting towards the high end of our guidance range relative to sales by the second half of the year and I think that starts to get us back into that range that our long-term model is based on in the 2% to 4%. Rodney McMullen : And the other thing, it's a great question. It's hard to give a specific data other than I can assure you that our team is working really hard to get there. We're also -- and this is something I would say we've always done, but you always try to get better. And if you look at capital investments, we would also be using capital investments to support that growth. And as you know, we're starting to increase the number of stores that we're opening. And the maturity of those stores and the remodel of those stores also help with identicals over time. And we would expect that to obviously be the case now. And as Todd mentioned, it's early in the slightly higher capital spending for new stores and expansions and stuff, but we're pleased with the early results. Thanks, Michael. Operator : And our next question comes from Michael Montani from Evercore. Michael Montani : Hey, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask if you could discuss the ID sales cadence through the quarter and then in the month of June. How should we think about ID sales for 2Q? And then I had a follow-up. Todd Foley : Yeah, the first quarter was a little choppy because we had a Easter mismatch relative to the calendar. But the general trend throughout the quarter was that we saw IDs increase steadily as we went through the quarter on average. And then as we look to Q2 to date, so far, we're right on plan relative to our expectations for Q2 results in the guidance that we've given. Rodney McMullen : Yeah, and as you know, we do expect IDs to improve throughout the year and we continue -- so far we're continuing to see that and would expect that to continue. Michael Montani : Got it. That's helpful. And if I could just wanted to try to better get the arms around some of the pharmacy pressures, is there anything that you could point to in the back half of the year, whether it be comparison-based or otherwise, that would help to alleviate some of those pressures or perhaps other sources of profit, whether it be media or fuel that could offset somewhat? Rodney McMullen : I'll make a couple of comments, and Todd, feel free to add. One of the things as you get to the third quarter and early in the fourth quarter is vaccines. And as you know, last year our teams did an amazing job of increasing the number of vaccines we gave. And we have a ton of learnings that we think will be able to do that again this year. And the -- so when you look at just the pharmacy business, part of that will be that. And also on some of the supply issues, we would hope that and expect for those to get more normalized and like the one drug that Todd was talking about, the generics, as they come out and stuff, historically, that's always improved profitability. And we would expect at some point in this latter part of the year for those things to happen. Relative to the other pieces, Todd, I'll let you. Todd Foley : You're right on with what I was going to say on pharmacy, Rodney, and just overall with the business. I alluded to earlier, the margin expansion efforts that we're seeing, and those are all factored into the guidance for the rest of the year. And even given those pharmacy headwinds, we expect the pharmacy or the margin expansion, the gross margin expansion initiatives that we have blended with the pharmacy headwinds that we called out should enable us to achieve gross profit results beyond what we saw in the first quarter. Rodney McMullen : Thanks, Michael. Operator : And our next question comes from Ed Kelly from Wells Fargo. Edward Kelly : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Rodney McMullen : Good morning. Edward Kelly : I wanted to start two questions. The first question I had is just around -- good morning -- it's just around the second quarter guidance. So in Q1, you beat on lower fuel margins and lower pharmacy. Q2, the guidance is coming down. Is that just solely based on pharmacy and incentive comp? Is there something else happening within here? I'm just trying to figure out the level of conservatism that is sitting in the second quarter guidance given what you just did in Q2 against all of this. Todd Foley : Yeah, no, you're right. And it is primarily based on pharmacy and incentive. You are correct. From a fuel perspective, that's so volatile. It's really week to week. It's part of what we keep our eye on as we go forward. So far it has been closer to our expectations for the quarter, but that's one that we truly monitor daily and weekly to understand the impact it's having on the business. Edward Kelly : All right. Then I guess a quick follow-up is just on leverage. So you continue to reiterate your leverage target. You are well below that at this point. Taking a step back, are there any advantages that you see to the business to running below the target long-term? Is this a metric that you think you would reassess post the Albertsons decision? Just curious as to how you're thinking about that. Todd Foley : I think long-term, our targets at 2.3 to 2.5 are in the right place. That is -- one of our key objectives is to maintain our investment grade rating and over time, it's proven that is the range that enables us to be able to do that. So I think we long-term continue to look to operate within that range, with or without the merger, frankly. And the beauty with where we're at here, you're right, we do have a lot of capacity there. Obviously, we're firmly focused on closing the merger and being able to use that capacity relative to the merger and come out the other end. But I think in any scenario, the capital allocation approach that we've taken over time, we've got a long track record on what that is and how we do it. And I would expect this to execute under that framework on a go-forward basis. Rodney McMullen : We really view our lowest cost of capital is a BBB rating. And if you look at it historically, it's like 80% of the time that would be the lowest cost of capital. And as you look at the markets going forward, we don't see anything that would cause that to change. So that gives you the financial flexibility to do things like merging with Albertsons. It also creates the lowest cost of capital. And the reason we always reiterate that 2.3 to 2.5 is that really is the point that we believe creates a solid BBB rating. And the thing that, as Todd and I both mentioned, the business continues to be incredibly strong from a free cash flow standpoint and the anticipation going forward. So it gives us the opportunity to continue to invest in the business, continue to grow the business, and we can't wait to be able to merge with Albertsons, so we can do that at even a scale a little bit bigger. So thanks, Ed, for the questions. Operator : And our next question comes from Kelly Bania from BMO. Kelly Bania : Hi. Good morning. This is Kelly Bania from BMO. Rodney McMullen : Good morning. Kelly Bania : Just wanted to ask about the volume and the tonnage outlook. I think you mentioned some positive momentum with the budget consumers and maybe an increasing customer count there. But how are volumes and tonnage trending year-over-year within your different customer cohorts? And how is that impacting your outlook for the full year in terms of tonnage and volume overall? Rodney McMullen : If you look, the tonnage trends are all trying to think if there's any exception to this, they're all in the right direction and they're improving. If you look at historically, part of that, we believe, is because of the moderating inflation, part of it is because of doing a better job on in-stock and the customer experience and connecting better with each customer segment. So we feel good about those trends for multiple of reasons. Was there a follow-up question or? Kelly Bania : Oh, yeah, thank you. I wasn't sure if you're done. Just wanted to ask maybe another question on the promotional and the competitive environment. It sounds like you characterize it maybe back to normal, I guess. What's different today about Kroger's kind of gross margin profile being more stable? And it sounds like maybe up a little bit in the next couple of quarters here relative to a few years ago, how much of that just rests on the Alternative Profit and the magnitude of that and the growth -- continued growth there versus anything different that you see in the gross margin for the kind of the core business? Todd Foley : Yeah, Kelly, I think it's -- you hit on part of it. I don't think it's just Alternative Profit. I think we have today more levers maybe than we've had in the past to be able to drive that value through margin expansion. So it's Alternative Profit and retail media. It's what our merchants do. We've already talked a little bit today about our brands and the value that our brand brings and the margin expansion there. And same with Fresh. I think it's all of those areas. And I think it's also the things that we continue to do with process improvement, whether it's in supply chain, whether it's continuing to drive down shrink, et cetera, et cetera. So I think it's the variety of margin improvement initiatives that we have. It is -- it's what's a little different than maybe what we saw several years ago, because we have various sources of value to help fund those investments in our customers and in our associates frankly. Rodney McMullen : Yeah. And if you look at some of the things that's in margin, like, warehouse and transportation costs, our teams are making good progress there, reducing the number of empty miles, taking and managing more of the transportation. So there's a lot -- one of the things, as you know, we've done a ton of work over the last five years or 10 years on diversifying our business model and how we create value. And part of it is the traffic that our base business creates being able to monetize that in ways that the customer actually views and finds of value. Thanks, Kelly. Operator : And our next question comes from Krisztina Katai from Deutsche Bank. Krisztina Katai : Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about the store execution plan that you implemented with the daily scoring system. Now you're really addressing some of the underperforming stores relative to the chain average. So one is what has been the biggest opportunity for some of the store-level improvements you're seeing? Just how much are they contributing to the traffic gains that you are also seeing? And just how best to think about further upside with both your budget-conscious customers but also the mainstream and the premium customers? Rodney McMullen : When you look at upside, I think, our whole team feels incredibly good. If you were in one of our meetings, you would hear us talk about all the things that we can get better at, and it's things that matter to our associates and matter to our customers. So we're incredibly excited about the continued opportunity we have on getting better. On the store execution, obviously, they always say retail is detail and it literally is working with every single store. As we mentioned in our prepared remarks, turnover continue to improve. When turnover is lower, when retention is better, it helps on the experience, it helps on the execution in the store, on in-stocks and other things. Our teams are doing a very good job on Fresh and that's everything from our supply chain to our folks ordering product to using AI to make sure the right stores get the right product, to the stores getting it out on the shelf and helping the customer have a couple more days of freshness at home. So it's really all of those things together that we think it's what's driving the increased traffic and increased in connection with our customers. So it's obviously super proud of the whole team and excited about the opportunities going in front of us. Krisztina Katai : Great. And just a quick follow-up. I hate to beat this, but just on the promo backdrop, just how should we think about your promotional basket? How much of that is proactive versus reactive that you are doing in the current environment? And I think you said that it's pretty much back to pre-COVID levels. Is it fair to assume that your vendor funding is also in line with pre-COVID levels or do you anticipate that to continue to ramp as your vendors are focusing on driving volumes? Thank you. Rodney McMullen : Yeah. If you look at vendor funding, we would expect it to continue to increase because you know that CPGs are trying to move tonnage. If you look at overall, we would, I think, feel like it's pretty much backed up pre-COVID but at a higher level. Some CPGs have increased their margins without, so they're just making flat-out more profit. So we think they actually have room to even further invest in trade dollars. Todd Foley : To your comment on reactive versus proactive, when we put our plan together for the year and our guidance in the whole nine yards, we put together our pricing strategy for the year and we're executing on the strategy that we've put in place and we think clearly customers are responding to that very favorably. We're not deviating from the plan that we have -- that we've put into place. We're executing our playbook. Rodney mentioned it earlier. It's what we've done for 15 years or 20 years and we've stuck to our playbook and we think that's what's resonating with our customers. Rodney McMullen : Yeah, there isn't things that are going on out there that I would say that's causing us to be reactive. You always pay attention and I spend as much time getting to the competitors' store as I do our own stores. But when I look at overall, we're running our plan and we're using our data and insights to make sure that we're taking care of our customers and associates. So I feel really good about where we are overall on that. So thanks for the questions. Operator : The next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research. Chuck Cerankosky : Good morning, everyone. Rodney McMullen : Good morning, Chuck. Chuck Cerankosky : I was cut off for a while, but it sounded like you said, Rodney, that your delivery sales doubled year-over-year in the first quarter. What's driving that? Is it just your execution or the customer demand? And when you look at customer demand for delivered groceries, how does it break down between budget-conscious customers and more affluent customers? Rodney McMullen : Yeah. If you look, sorry that you got cut off, but the delivery business almost doubled year-on-year. It's pretty broad based on all customer segments, but I think one of the things that's important to remember is that our technology allows us to do a better job now accepting SNAP and some of those things than what it did a year ago. So it's really across all customers. I think the thing that's driving it is our teams are doing a nice job on making sure the experience is good. I can tell you in Florida, people get ice cream that's still frozen and chocolate that's not melted because of our delivery, because of the delivery trucks. And it's really -- it's one of those things where all the things you feel good about, we still have a lot of work to make sure that we're satisfied with the profitability. Chuck Cerankosky : Are there any CPG promotions or monies made available to help get that customer to make the first delivery order? Rodney McMullen : Yes. The short answer is yes. And there's, as you know, online and with our data and personalization, there's all kinds of things that you're learning in terms of different customers find it attractive at different times. So the short answer is absolutely yes. The other thing is, obviously online really supports the Alternative Profit business as well from a media standpoint. Thanks, Chuck. Chuck Cerankosky : Thanks, Rodney. Good luck for the rest of the year. Rodney McMullen : Thank you. Appreciate it. Operator : The question-and-answer session is now finished. So I will hand back over to Rodney for any final remarks. Rodney McMullen : Thank you for all the questions, as always. As you know, I always like to share a few comments with our associates listening in. Today I'd like to take a moment to celebrate Alex Spurlock. Alex is a store leader at QFC store 860 in Redmond, Washington, and recently was named the 2024 Food Industry Association Store Leader of the Year. Obviously, this is a huge honor and we are so impressed by the amazing work that Alex does at her store. With more than a decade in the grocery business, Alex understands the industry. She has a gentle spirit and a fierce attention to detail that clearly earned her this recognition. What's most impressive is Alex's passion for her associates. She is always ready to coach her team and celebrate their success in meaningful ways. Thank you and congratulations, Alex, for everything you do for our customers and your fellow associates. And congratulations on this amazing honor. And thank you to all of our teams for all the work they do every day to take care of each other and our associates and thank you for everyone for joining us today. Operator : That does conclude today's conference call. Have a nice day. You may now disconnect your lines.",

I'd now like to turn the conference over to Rob Quast, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Rob Quast : Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. I am joined today by Kroger's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen; and Interim Chief Financial Officer, Todd Foley. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today's discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Company assumes no obligation to update that information. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question if necessary. I will now turn the call over to Rodney. Rodney McMullen : Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we begin, I'd like to provide an outline of our discussion topics this morning. I will start by sharing a recap of our second quarter performance and highlight how we continue to advance our go-to-market strategy, which powers our value creation model and drives long term sustainable growth for our shareholders. Then Todd will cover our financial results for the second quarter, and finally, I will close with an update on our pending merger with Albertsons. Turning to our performance this quarter, we continue to execute our strategy and we are delivering solid financial results through the strength and diversity of our model. We are driving positive customer activity with a compelling combination of affordable prices and personalized promotions on great quality products, all through a unique seamless experience. Our strong customer trends also reflect our enhanced focus on elevating the customer experience through excellent store execution, which continued into the second quarter. Customers continue adjusting to the current economic environment. The reduction of excess savings built up during the pandemic, higher interest rates and the effect of inflation are pressuring customers' ability to spend. This is especially true for our most budget-conscious customers, as we've been seeing for a while now, but we're now seeing other customer segments beginning to make changes as well. Customers are purchasing lower-priced cuts of meat, buying less and focusing on essentials. Budget-conscious customers are buying more at the beginning of the month to stock up on essential items and groceries. And then as the month progresses, they are more cautious with their spending. In response, we are supporting our customers by keeping prices low through promotions, including loyalty discounts, personalized offers and fuel rewards. We are also expanding our multi-tiered portfolio of Our Brands products, which provides customers exceptional alternatives to national brands competing on quality, while at a noticeable lower price point. Our long term model demonstrates that by consistently keeping prices low, we increase customer loyalty and grow share of wallet. While the food-at-home industry remains competitive, our model drives efficiencies that allow us to sustainably invest in value and maintain competitive price spreads with key competitors. In addition to lowering prices, we executed our go-to-market strategy through our pillars of Fresh, Our Brands, personalization and seamless. We are proud of our associates for bringing this strategy to life with another quarter of excellent store execution. This led to another quarter of strong customer trends, including total and loyal household growth and an increase in customer visits. Mainstream households, our largest customer segment, led our sales growth through more households and increased visits. By delivering a more consistent customer experience, we are moving customers up the loyalty ladder and positioning ourselves for long term sales growth. I'd now like to cover how we are enhancing our go-to-market strategy, starting by leading with Fresh. Our Fresh for Everyone promise reflects our commitment that customers can trust the quality and freshness of every item they purchase. This promise is only possible through our strong relationships with farmers and suppliers, which enables Kroger to source the freshest products. Field & Vine, one of the newest Our Brands lines, offers regionally grown berries picked at peak freshness. We are very pleased with the initial customer response to this line. Our Brands is an important differentiator for our business, enabling us to offer innovative products at a great value. This combination of quality and value led to Our Brands sales growth outpacing national brand sales growth this quarter. More than 90% of our customer households purchased Our Brands products during that time. Across the portfolio of Our Brands, we are expanding into new categories and launching new products with almost 600 already introduced this year. Each of these new products is thoroughly tested and validated to earn its spot on our shelves, competing aggressively with national brands with no compromise on quality. Smart Way, one of our opening price point brands, is delivering exceptional value to customers on a budget. These are ultra low-priced essentials and pantry staples that we know our customers need the most. We continued expanding the Smart Way lineup in the second quarter to meet our customer needs for more value. We are also making progress on Our Brands refreshment roll out, with more of Our Brands portfolio to be refreshed later this year. We are excited to see our customers respond to these new designs. As we innovate within the portfolio and expand to meet customer needs, we are improving our mix and driving better profitability. For example, our manufacturing plants allow us to make many of our own products, keeping costs lower as we pass those savings on to customers while preserving our ability to grow margins. Next is an update on personalization. Our loyalty program and personalized promotions enabled us to deliver value beyond the shelf price. We collect data and insights, which enable us to enhance our personalization capabilities, delivering better product recommendations and more effective promotions. As a result, we are generating greater unit lift on promotions compared to the industry. Boost, our paid membership program supports our personalization capabilities. This quarter, we held a Boost Bonus Days event, which provided Boost customers even more savings during the two week special event. This event went well above and beyond the incredible value the membership already offers with daily savings, free delivery on orders of $35 or more and two times fuel points. Now turning to seamless. Digital sales grew 11%, driven by an increase in both households and traffic. One of the many ways we move customers up the loyalty ladder is to convert digitally-engaged households into e-commerce households. This means we are moving customers from simply using our app or website to making purchases through one of these digital channels. This work resulted in our teams growing e-commerce households 14% this quarter. Households who shop with us digitally and in our stores are important because they are our most loyal and increase retail media and monetization opportunities. Delivery solutions led our sales growth once again this quarter, with pickup also showing very strong demand. Demand across our Kroger delivery network, which provides customers a premium shopping experience, continues to grow. Customers tell us they love the convenience of on-time and refrigerated delivery right to their homes. Profitability remains a key focus as we drive volume growth through our Customer Fulfillment Centers. Our teams are working hard to improve the shape of weekly and daily demand as well as refining trade areas to improve customer delivery density. By executing our go-to-market strategy, we are building loyalty and creating more growth opportunities. First, with alternative profit businesses, which had a strong quarter, led by growth in Kroger Precision Marketing, their results were in line with internal expectations and keep us on track to deliver more than 20% media growth this year. Next is health and wellness, we continue to be optimistic about this area of our business. We know that grocery customers, who are also pharmacy customers, are more loyal to Kroger, and spend more with us. While the pharmacy industry is going through a period of transformation and disruption, we have a unique opportunity to help our customers live healthier lives and grow share. Over the long term, we remain confident and our teams are working hard to navigate industry challenges and position the company for future growth. During the quarter, sales outpaced internal expectations. Profitability was similar to last year, but behind internal expectations due to product mix pressures, specifically as a result of strong GLP-1 sales. We expect GLP-1s to have a similar impact on our results for the remainder of the year. Our vaccine efforts are ramping up now and should help offset some of the GLP-1 impact in the second half of the year. Turning to associates, our full fresh and friendly commitment is our roadmap to achieving a best-in-class customer experience, and we appreciate our associates for delivering again this quarter. We are facilitating this improved customer experience through our commitment to be an employer of choice. We are achieving this by investing in associate wages and by continuing to create an outstanding supportive work environment. It is great to see these efforts recognized with a perfect score on the 2024 Disability Inclusion Equality Index, making Kroger a Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion for the fifth consecutive year. With that, I'll now turn it over to Todd to take you through our second quarter financial results. Todd? Todd Foley : Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger's second quarter results reflect the resilience of our model as investments made to diversify our business are enabling us to navigate an environment of economic uncertainty. Our results through the first half of the year are in line with our expectations, and with our improving sales momentum, we are able to reaffirm our full year guidance. I'll now take you through our second quarter financial results. We achieved identical sales without fuel growth of 1.2%. As Rodney mentioned earlier, identical sales were supported by several positive customer metric trends, including increases in total and loyal households and increased customer visits. We are encouraged by favorable unit trends as we continue to make progress toward achieving positive unit growth. As we saw in the first quarter, vendor support for promotions has been strong, and we will continue to deliver on our long term commitment of providing customers with exceptional value. Digital sales had a strong quarter, led by 17% growth in delivery solutions. Pickup is an important part of our seamless ecosystem and demand continues to be strong, with pickup sales growing 10%. This reflects our digital team's relentless focus on delivering a great customer experience, resulting in increased fill rates, a reduction in wait times and a 33% improvement in perfect orders, which are orders with both a 100% fill rate and that are completed within an appropriate wait time. With the help of AI-enabled advancements and dynamic batching and routing, we are able to offer two hour lead times and pickup in all stores. These improvements in customer experience are being accompanied by productivity enhancements, resulting in an improvement in our cost to serve. Turning to margins, I would like to spend a little more time today talking about our second quarter trends in gross margin and OG&A rates. As you know, our long term model is designed to deliver consistent year-over-year gross margin rate and OG&A rates in a way that we deliver slightly expanding operating margins over time. Though there can be puts and takes in these measures from quarter-to-quarter, over the long term, our business model gives us the flexibility to balance investments in lower prices and higher associate wages with growth in margins through Our Brands and alternative profit businesses as well as cost-saving initiatives and productivity, all to ensure that we are consistently returning value to shareholders. This expectation is true for fiscal 2024 as well. For the full year, we now expect FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, to be slightly positive, balanced by the OG&A rate without fuel, which will be slightly negative. This quarter, FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, was 42 basis points favorable to last year and was slightly ahead of our expectations for the quarter. Conversely, the OG&A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items, was 65 basis points unfavorable to last year as well as unfavorable to our expectations, primarily due to several nonrecurring charges during the quarter. Looking in more detail at our quarterly results, gross margin was 22.6% of sales. The increase in FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, was primarily attributable to favorable product mix in our grocery business, including Our Brands, lower shrink and sourcing benefits, partially offset by lower pharmacy margins. The result reflected Kroger's ability to improve margin while being competitive on price and helping customers manage their budgets. The improvement in shrink reflects the significant ongoing work from our operations team as they address this challenging issue. While we are pleased with the result this quarter, shrink related to theft remains high on a historical basis, and we still have work to do to further mitigate the financial impact. The increase in OG&A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items, was driven by investments in associate wages, increased incentive plan costs and nonrecurring costs, including hurricane expenses and an increase in costs due to the severity of general liability claims, partially offset by continued execution of cost savings initiatives. During the second quarter, we recorded a LIFO charge of $21 million, compared to a charge of $4 million for the same quarter last year. Adjusted FIFO operating profit was $984 million. Our adjusted EPS was $0.93 per diluted share, a decline of 3% compared to last year. Fuel is an important part of our total value proposition. It builds loyalty through our Kroger Plus program by offering customers another way to save and led to gallon sales outpacing the industry this quarter. Fuel profitability was stronger in the second quarter compared to last year on a cents per gallon basis. In the second half, we will be cycling stronger fuel results, but expect margins to be relatively flat compared to last year. I wanted to provide a brief update on inflation, a topic I am asked about frequently. Inflation increased slightly in the second quarter from the first quarter, but is trending around 1%, which is consistent with our expectations since the start of the year. I'd now like to provide a brief update on associates and labor relations. During the second quarter, we ratified new labor agreements for our Food 4 Less warehouse stores in Southern California, Columbus Valley stores, Mid-Atlantic Division stores, Anderson Bakery, Michigan, West Michigan and New Market clerks, Central Peoria clerks and Shelbyville warehouse, covering more than 13,000 associates. Kroger is working to reach an agreement with the UFCW for meat and grocery associates at 29 Fred Meyer stores in Portland. We respect our associates' right to collectively bargain. Associates at these stores chose to strike for six days before returning to work last week. Negotiations continue this week, and we remain open to constructive dialogue with the UFCW. We are also communicating to local unions. They are coming to the table with proposals that do not balance investing in associates, with keeping groceries affordable for our customers and supporting a growing and profitable business model are untenable. It underlines our goal of growing the company in a way that helps to ensure job security and create more jobs and advancement opportunities for more associates. Turning to cash flow, Kroger continues to generate strong adjusted free cash flow through consistent operating results. Consistent generation of free cash flow is an important part of our model and is enabling us to deleverage in anticipation of our merger with Albertsons. At the end of the second quarter, Kroger's net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.24, compared to our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Our strengthened balance sheet provides us flexibility to pursue growth and enhance shareholder value. We continue to take a disciplined approach to deploying capital, prioritizing the highest growth opportunities that strengthen our business and deliver solid returns for shareholders. We're committed to maintaining our investment-grade debt rating, increasing our dividend over time, subject to Board approval and returning excess capital to shareholders when we are able to do so. The strength of our free cash flow gives us the ability to invest in the growth of our business. We are allocating more capital to our major and minor store projects this year. Our teams have done an excellent job completing projects ahead of schedule. And year-to-date, we have completed almost double the amount of store projects as we had completed last year at this time, which will position us to grow in the second half of 2024 and 2025. It also creates capacity later this year to work towards opening 2025 projects earlier in the year as well. To reflect this, we are raising our guidance for full year capital expenditures from a range of $3.4 billion to $3.6 billion to a range of $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion. Based on the strength of our free cash flow, the change to our CapEx guidance does not affect our adjusted free cash flow guidance. In the second quarter, we raised our quarterly dividend by 10%, reflecting confidence in our ability to generate strong cash flow. Our quarterly dividend has grown at a 13.5% compounded annual growth rate since being reinstated in 2006, and this marked the 18th consecutive year of dividend increases. I'd now like to provide some additional color on our outlook for the rest of the year. We are encouraged by our performance through the first half of the year, which led to results that were in line with expectations. Our solid sales results through the first two quarters of the year give us confidence to raise the low end of our full year identical sales without fuel guidance. We now expect identical sales without fuel to be in the range of 0.75% to 1.75%. We are cautiously optimistic about our sales outlook for the second half of the year and expect customers to continue prioritizing food and essentials. We have developed merchandising plans that are designed to enhance customer engagement, drive spending and improve unit volumes. The strength of our model enables us to navigate an environment where customer spending is constrained by current economic pressures, and we expect the various components of our model, including grocery, health and wellness, fuel and alternative profit businesses to provide us with flexibility in how we create shareholder value. As a result, we are reaffirming the rest of our full year guidance. I'll now turn the call back to Rodney. Rodney McMullen : Thanks, Todd. Before I open it up for Q&A, I'd like to speak briefly about our pending merger with Albertsons. First, I would like to express my appreciation for our associates and their incredible commitment. It has been a long journey, and our associates have done an excellent job serving customers and running the day-to-day operations of our business, while also preparing for the merger. Integration work continues to progress, and our teams are laser-focused on ensuring a seamless transition for our customers and associates from day one. It is exciting to see the complementary strengths of both Kroger and Albertsons organizations, and we look forward to combining these strengths to provide customers an even better experience. As part of our merger preparation, Kroger recently launched an exchange offering for Albertsons notes, contingent upon the closing of the merger as well as a successful new offering for $10.5 billion of senior unsecured notes with the net proceeds expected to fund a portion of the cash consideration for the proposed merger. A portion of the proceeds of this offering is subject to a special mandatory redemption if the merger does not close. As the preliminary injunction trial with the FTC nears its conclusion, we are confident in the facts and the strengths of our position. The retail industry continues to be more competitive, and we know how our customers shop. Every day, they are making decisions on where to eat and where to buy their groceries. They shop at a wide range of competitors from Costco to Amazon to Dollar Stores, and they eat at restaurants. They shop digitally and brick-and-mortar. As I have said before, we remain committed to closing the merger because it will provide meaningful and measurable benefits for customers, associates and communities across the country, and we look forward to bringing these commitments to life. Regardless of the outcome of the trials, Kroger is operating from a position of strength and we are optimistic about our future. Our business is more diverse than ever, and our value creation model provides us with multiple ways to drive sustainable growth. We are delivering strong free cash flow that allows us to invest in our business and drive attractive returns for our shareholders. With that, Todd and I look forward to taking your questions. Because we are in litigation, we will not be taking questions on the merger this morning. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from Ed Kelly of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Edward Kelly : Hi, good morning, everyone. Rodney McMullen : Good morning. Edward Kelly : There's been increased concern around the competitive backdrop, rising promotions across the industry. Can you just talk about what you are seeing from a promotional and competitive standpoint? And then what are your plans as you think about the back half of the year? I mean you did raise the gross margin guidance a bit today. So it certainly seems like you believe you can manage it. But just thoughts around what's going on out there and your promotional plans. Rodney McMullen : Yeah, if you look, I would say the promotions are getting back to pretty much normal. And obviously, during COVID there was less promotions because supply chains were under tremendous pressure. The other thing that we would say on the promotions we are doing, we view -- the ones that we're doing are more effective and the CPG partners are increasing their support for some of those as well as they're trying to grow tonnage. If you look at -- as Todd outlined, overall, we feel good about the balance of the year and balancing cost reductions and mix changes that are helping gross and our continued investment in pricing, which we've been doing for, I think, close to 20 years now. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kelly Bania from BMO. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Kelly Bania : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking our questions. Just wanted to dive in a little bit more on gross margin. It was really quite strong, and you called out some of the factors there. But can you help us just understand how digital is impacting gross margin? Is that included in your kind of mix category? And just a general update on digital profitability as you look forward really into the back half and the next couple of years here? Todd Foley : Yes. Be glad to, Kelly. Yes, you're right. As we went into the year, we talked about the expectations for our margins to be relatively flat. And included in that expectation was a little bit of an increase in the second quarter year-over-year. But even on top of that, some of the strength that we saw in Our Brands, like we called out, we had a tremendous quarter in Our Brands, actually, the sales growth there outpaced national brands quite meaningfully that helped drive it above our expectations. And also, we had a great shrink quarter. It's been a while since we've looked year-over-year on shrink and seen positive results. So that's really exciting to see as we called out. Still a lot of work to do there on a go-forward basis. So it was a little bit better than our expectations, which were to be up some, and therefore, for the balance of the year, we do expect for the full year margins to now be slightly favorable on a year-over-year basis. So from a digital profitability standpoint, Rodney, if you want to add anything in that space? Rodney McMullen : Yes, I'll just a couple of comments. We continue to make progress. If you look at over the next two or three years, we see the opportunity to make significant progress, and we would hold ourselves accountable for doing that. The thing that's pretty special about the overall ecosystem that we're building, is when you look at a customer that engages with us seamless, they actually still physically go into stores. Sometimes they do delivery, sometimes they do pick up. They also become more loyal in other aspects, becoming Boost members, engaging in pharmacy. So as you look out over the next two or three years, we are very excited about the potential of that and the continued progress. Obviously, the media business helps gross margin and the margins in that is significantly different than anything that we've ever sold in the supermarket store. Thanks Kelly. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Partners. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Anders Myhre : Good morning. This is Anders Myhre on for John. Between the proactive cost reductions, the media growth and the moderating digital losses, should we expect a greater amount of P&L benefits than there have been in recent years? And if so, how much of this incremental benefit flows through to the bottom line versus reinvestment into other areas of the business? Thank you. Todd Foley : Yeah. Great question. The things that you call out are great examples of some of the margin enhancement programs that we've talked about in the past as well as some of the productivity improvements and cost improvements that we've realized over time. That's an important part of our overall business model, being able to use that value that we create through the things that you called out to invest it back in the business. Rodney alluded to it. We have a long history of taking that value and reinvesting it back in the business in a way that over time, our operating profit rate grows slightly over time. So as we grow the top line, as we're able to balance the investments with the benefits that we get from those that drives the bottom line over time. Rodney McMullen : Yes, I think it's always a good reminder that our long term TSR model is 8% to 11% a year. That long term TSR model assumes that we continue to move and grow alternative profit businesses, continue to invest in wages, continue to invest in lower prices for our customers. As you know fortunately, we generate a tremendous amount of free cash flow. We would expect over time for more of that growth to come from the business as opposed to buying back stock. And then once the merger happens, obviously, there's incremental accretion that will happen because of the merger for a period of time that once the merger happens, we'll give more insights into. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Leah Jordan of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Leah Jordan : Good morning. Thank your for taking my question. Thinking if you could comment on your market share trends in the quarter, and especially interested in any color on what you're seeing in Fresh specifically as I know that's been a big area of investment for you? Rodney McMullen : Yes. If you look at our Fresh trends overall, they would be stronger than the center store. Overall, I would say that we feel okay about where we are. But if you look, going forward, we continue to see improvement, and we would expect to see improvement throughout the balance of the year. So it's one of those areas where we're not satisfied. We are gaining strong household growth and strong loyal household growth as well, which also, in the past, always leads to future progress as well. So I would say that we feel okay where we are. We're more excited about what we see where the trends are and where we see for the balance of the year and next year because we're also incrementally adding storing [ph] as well, which helps on market share as well. Thanks Leah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Simeon Gutman : Good morning, everyone. Two-parter. First, if you look at the second quarter and the second half, the difference in comp that you're guiding to, how is it changing between units and inflation? I heard the inflation piece, but curious how the guidance reflects this. It looks like it's slightly better than consensus. The second part is, if this environment stays, and I know you're not -- you're trying to improve share and grow comps. But if we stay in this very low single-digit environment, do you spend the same way in the business next year, and you think you can keep the core EBIT dollars roughly flat or margin flat in this backdrop? Thank you. Todd Foley : Yes. Good question, Simeon. Let me start with the differences in comp. We did update our sales guidance for the year, taking up the bottom end of that range, as you saw from 25 basis points to 75 basis points, but kept the top end of the range at 1.75 basis points. And I think our thought process around that was really to take the low end off the table. If you think about where we came into the year, and there was quite a bit of disinflation last year. That was still kind of hitting us early in the year and wanted to make sure that we were navigating through that uncertainty. Our view at the time was that Q1 would be the low point of the year, and we would consistently grow our sales as we went through the year on a backdrop of inflation that was 1%-ish as we go throughout the year. And that's really -- certainly through the first half, it's played out as we expected in the first half of the year. And our expectations for the back half are very similar to the way that we thought about it back then. So I would say both our expectations on the sales and the inflation environment backdrop against which, it hasn't really changed a whole lot, and we expect that growth to flow. From a unit standpoint, we've talked about that a little bit. Rodney alluded to the fact we continue to be encouraged by the trends there. We're still a little negative on the unit side, but we continue to be encouraged by the progress that we're making in that space and think that will be part of the contribution to the sales trend that we see for the back half of the year. Rodney McMullen : Yeah, we are seeing progress on units. We would expect to continue to see progress on units. You didn't really ask, but if -- the thing that's right now, what we're seeing is, and I mentioned it earlier, in the first of the month, our business is really strong, holidays are strong. And then when you get to the end of the month, they're weaker because of the people being constrained on a budget. So far in the third quarter, we're tracking a little bit better than where we were in the second quarter. So fundamentally, we believe all the programs we're doing is making improved connection. Your question relative to 2025, I would say it's still early for us to start sharing guidance on 2025, and I would just -- the comments I made earlier about our long term business model really would apply to 2025. Obviously, we would expect to be in a position of where we've just completed a merger, and we would also need to update where we are relative to the merger and the integration of the merger and those factors as well. So thanks, Simeon, for the question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Montani of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Michael Montani : Great. Thank you for taking the question. It seems that the guide is implying a stable or even slightly up EBIT margin in the back half of the year. And I just wanted to understand a little bit if you could parse out the drivers behind that, in particular, with relation to shrink, if there's favorable compares coming up that give you confidence, and/or if there's certain onetime costs that you could quantify for us on OG&A that wouldn't come up again? Todd Foley : Yeah. We'll do, Michael. You're right. Great call out. And as we look at the back half of the year, we talked about, given the trends that we saw in the second quarter, our view for the year on gross margin would be that it will be slightly favorable year-over-year. And on OG&A, the annual trend will be slightly unfavorable year-over-year. But we do expect those to reasonably balance as they come out. We talked a little bit about shrink earlier. And again, we're really excited about the results that we saw in shrink, but I mentioned the caution that we have there. There is a lot of work to do. That issue is still out there. And our shrink costs are high relative to history on where we've been this. So our team continues to work in that space and continues to drive it. You can't have a trend until you have a data point. And so we're excited to see where we're at, but we're kind of cautiously optimistic about the opportunities for shrink for the balance of the year. Relative to some of the other costs-- Rodney McMullen : Before you move on, one additional shrink, Michael, that you might -- that everyone might find helpful is if you look at our Fresh side of our business, we've made meaningful progress on improving shrink over several quarters. Now when you look at the center store with organized retail crime and other things, you couldn't see it. But there's been tremendous changes by using technology, AI processes, and our teams have done a nice job of improving the Fresh side on shrink. That's not subject to as much theft, but it's really process-oriented. So now, Todd, I'll let you go and talk about some of the other stuff. Todd Foley : Yes. Great color, I appreciate that. Talking a little bit on the cost side, there are -- we did see in the second quarter in part of why it was a little bit worse than our expectations, some non-recurring type of items. The main one was some costs related to Hurricane Beryl that came through. Obviously, that was event-driven relative to that. The second, and we've talked a little bit about this, we've talked about incentive being a little bit higher than our expectations. We do think for the second half of the year that will have less of an impact on our year-over-year OG&A than what we've seen in the past as well. So I think those are a couple of the examples of things that we don't expect to continue in the second half. Rodney McMullen : Thanks Michael. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Kenneth Goldman of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Kenneth Goldman : Hi, thank you and good morning. I wanted to dig in a little bit deeper into inflation, just in light of the CPI and PPI numbers that came out this morning. Usually the two rates have changed. They're not perfectly correlated, but they're somewhat correlated. And right now, PPI food is increasing at a faster clip than CPI. So I just wanted to get a sense for how you think about balancing the need to pass on inflation? I know that PPI is not a perfect proxy for that, but it's somewhat of a proxy. Balance that with the desire to continue to appeal to budget-conscious consumers, and then how do we reconcile all of that with the fact that your GM growth was so good when PPI is growing so much faster than CPI? Rodney McMullen : Yes. As you've mentioned, I mean, you're always trying to balance all the pieces. Part of the PPI is it's -- certain parts of it are commodity-driven. And we will -- if we think something is a permanent cost increase then we try to pass that along as fast as we can. If it's a short-term blip, then we'll manage that based on what's going on in the market. And it's as difficult now estimating where inflation is going to be as probably any period of time, but we are seeing it being reasonably stable. If you look out in terms of price increases that CPGs have already shared with us because obviously, we'll see that in advance of it happening, it would certainly still be in the range of where we said we think overall inflation will be around 1%. And we don't see anything that's causing us to see that be much different than that. Over time, we do find the two kind of line up pretty close. The other thing that we are seeing is inflation on food away from home is meaningfully higher than food at home. And we are beginning to see customers move back from restaurants to food at home because you can prepare a meal at home for about a fourth of the cost of going out and getting a meal. So that is something that we are beginning to see a little bit of as well. I don't know, Todd, anything else you want to add on inflation? Todd Foley : I don't. Thanks, Rodney. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Rupesh Parikh : Good morning. Rodney McMullen : Good morning. Rupesh Parikh : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So first on CapEx, so higher range for this year. So I just want to get a sense of if we should think about this level of spend as more of a normal going forward. And then secondly, not sure if you're giving any clarity in terms of how to think about the EPS growth cadence between Q3 and Q4 as I know you're lapping the 53rd week later this year. Todd Foley : Yes. Great color, Rupesh. On the CapEx, yes I think we talked about it. We've been working really hard to take the opportunity to get these storing projects open as quickly as we can to be able to serve customers. And so shifting spend from late in '24 to early in '24. You saw our CapEx year-to-date be a little bit higher. That's going to create some capacity to help us pull early -- what might have been early '25 construction process into late '24, so we can open next year's projects early too. So I think given the strong cash flow in the business, if we're able to continue to execute that, then I think what we'll see should be a lift in our spend in our capital plan over time. Rodney McMullen : And we're -- the money that we're investing, we're seeing good performance to budget as well. And operationally, it's a lot easier to open up a remodel or new store expansion earlier in the year versus later in the year as well. Todd Foley : And then talking to your EPS comment, Rupesh, yes, for the balance of -- given where we landed in the first quarter in our actual results -- for the first half of the year, sorry, our first half kind of landed where we expected it to, quarter's played out a little bit differently than we thought. But the first half landed where we expected. And reaffirming the rest of the year, the back half, we think is right on par with where we've been guiding as well. Within that, we do think that the third quarter will be probably slightly ahead of where we were year-over-year and the fourth quarter probably slightly behind on a 52-week basis when you compare it 52 to 52, but that's probably how the trend will play out for the balance of the year. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Mark Carden : Good morning. It's Mark Carden on for Michael Lasser this morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. So you talked about some of the trade down that's accelerated in 2Q to additional income cohorts, and also highlight some of the pressures that budget customers are facing. What kinds of behavior changes are you seeing in your middle income and above cohorts? And when did you see this become more pronounced? Rodney McMullen : Yes. It's throughout the year, and as I mentioned before, we're seeing it more at the end of the month than the beginning of the month. And people continue to be aggressive or whatever the right term is on celebrating holidays. Now I think one of the things that's always important to remember is those changes aren't -- many of those changes are beneficial to us. So if you think about people moving from eating at a restaurant to cooking at home, that's beneficial for us. If we look at customers' changing segments, that's good for us because they typically will buy more Our Brands, products and they'll buy smaller packages and some of those things as well. So when we look, it's been really throughout. But I would say, over the last few months, it's been more pronounced as you get toward the end of the month. But all of those things are things that -- obviously, you're changing your promotional approach, your connection with the customers, what offers you make at different times of the month and all those things. So overall, the customer, as we've said all along, are under tremendous strain, especially customers on a budget. That was the reason why I want to say it was probably 1.5 years ago or 2 years ago, we saw that coming, and we introduced our Smart Way product to be much more aggressive on having an entry price point item because that was a trend that we saw coming and trying to be proactive on addressing that, and we continue to add product in that. But for us, we're going to do everything we can to help a customer be able to have a great meal without compromising and eating as a family. And so far, the changes the customer is experiencing, we're making changes to trying to support the customer and the customer is connecting well with that. So you feel for people in terms of where they are, and we're going to do everything we can to try to help support them on what their particular situation is. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Ohmes of Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Robert Ohmes : Thanks for taking my question. Maybe, Todd, for you, can we get even -- you gave some color already on the OG&A line for the back half. Maybe a little more how -- where is Kroger on the wage pressure in the back half of the year, say versus the front half? And also, you guys called out general liability claims. You're not the only retailer to call that out this quarter. If we get some -- how much pressure was that in the second quarter and is that an issue or a pressure in the back half? Thanks. Todd Foley : Yes. No, great call out. Relative to second half OG&A again, given what we saw in the second quarter, our guidance on the year is now we will be slightly unfavorable to where we were a year ago. But beyond that, I think our trends will be as expected in the second half of the year. You talk about wage pressure. One thing to keep in mind on our wage pressure is because so many of our wages come through collective bargaining agreements, we've got 300 or so of those. But at any point in time, probably 75% of our wages are locked in, in a collective bargaining agreement. We have maybe a third or a quarter of those that are up each year that we constantly negotiate. So the guidance that we have out there reflects those expectations and where we're at from a wage perspective because most of those are known to us going into the year. Your comment on GL claims, there's really two pieces to general liability. The incident rate piece is -- actually our results are phenomenal. When you look at it through the lens of OSHA incident rates, we're very much below where the industry averages are at. And even as a company where we're at, we're in that kind of record low territory there, at least in modern history. And so we're extremely excited about the work that the teams do to manage the incidents from that standpoint and the number of claims. What we saw as we were going through our analysis this time was around the average cost of the claim, and what we were seeing relative to the cost to settle some of these claims being much higher. Given the environment that's out there, we're seeing more and more pressure on the average cost to settle those claims. And so as we evaluated what we had outstanding for reserves in that space, given that trend, we thought it was wise to update it. We have done a nice job in the past trying to mitigating those claims and have a variety of strategies to put into place, and we'll continue to be able to put more of those types of items in place to be more effective in keeping that average cost down. But I think the announces that we did, I think, has us comfortable with where we need to be now and we don't expect that to recur in the back half of the year. Rodney McMullen : One other comment I would add to -- Robbie, to the OG&A comment that Todd was talking about is, we feel like we've developed a good skill on being able to identify cost reductions over time. And we would expect that's a skill that we'll have also as you look out in the second half and forward in next year as well. The other thing that our teams have done a nice job on is continuing to find process changes to be able to operate a store with less labor and simplify the store to run. And it's one of those where we've made good progress, but we still think we have plenty of opportunity to get better going forward. So I really appreciate the question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky from Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Chuck Cerankosky : Good morning, everyone. Rodney McMullen : Good morning. Chuck Cerankosky : Rodney, when you look at the sales growth challenges, you mentioned the economic factors putting pressure on consumers, and it seems to be a wide range of consumers. But you also have nontraditional competitors put pressure on the supermarket channel. Can you sort of compare what the strengths of those difficult headwinds are as you're trying to accelerate sales at Kroger? Rodney McMullen : Yeah, the increase in non-traditional competitors, obviously, has been a 20-year trend. And when you look at Amazon and Costco and Walmart and I could go on and on for the litany, those in terms of how do you be successful against them really is how do you continue to change your basic offering to the customer and supporting the customers' changes. And we felt good about those changes that we've made, but we still need to continue to make them. And it's one of those things where, if you ever think you've figured it out, it's -- I would say that it's not good, you need to change. So we feel good about our ability to compete. We'll have to continually change. It's the reason why we've invested so much in staying connected with the customer on a seamless perspective, continuing to invest in wages, continuing to invest in promotion, but making up some of those things with alternative profit growth and mix. And over time, we would hope food away -- a more stronger competitor on food away from home because half of the money that's spent on food is food away from home. And we see no reason why we shouldn't be able to get a share of that. If you look at the economic pressure so far, we feel confident in our ability to deal with it or manage it or whatever because there's -- fortunately, we have a large business, and there's a lot of moving parts. And Our Brands obviously had a strong quarter. We think the opportunity is even stronger in Our Brands and things like that, which helps support the customer that's under that economic pressure as well. So on those so far, I mean, if you had a depression, I wouldn't -- I would give a different answer. But so far on the things that we're seeing, we feel comfortable or confident in our ability to deal with those changes. Thanks Chuck. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Feldman from Telsey Advisory Group. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Joe Feldman : Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Rodney McMullen : Good morning. Joe Feldman : I wanted to ask about inventory level, which was down a little bit and down, I think, almost 3%, which is really good shape. I'm wondering how you guys are thinking about inventory going forward? And what drove that? Was it you guys -- is it fewer units? Is it because the prices have just come down a bit year-over-year, so you've been able to be lower inventory levels because of that? Maybe you could just share a little more color around that going forward. Todd Foley : Yes. Great question, Joe. And I think you hit on some of the keys. I think it's a variety of things. Inventory, it's -- part of it is we're seeing less cost inflation, so the average cost of an item on the shelf is a little bit less. But we have also been very laser-focused relative to working capital and working capital management. When we talk about our strong cash flow generation, that's an important part of that is balancing our working capital. And it's -- both of those go together. It's always having the right tension between making sure we're in stock for our customers and having what our customers need, but making sure we don't have too much there so that we're being a good steward of working capital. So I think what you're seeing on the balance sheet is the combination of lower cost per item, relative inflation year-over-year and the right level of working capital management to make sure we're in stock for our customers. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will take no further questions for today, so I'll hand back to Rodney for any further remarks. Rodney McMullen : Thanks, Alex and thank you to all for all your questions. And as you know, before we conclude our call, we always like to -- we have many of our associates listening in, and we always like to share a couple of comments with them. And I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge our 2024 Kroger Scholars. Since the Kroger Scholars Program was launched in 2008, we've awarded more than 3,300 scholarships, totaling almost $5 million to children of our associates. These recipients were selected based on a broad range of criteria, including their volunteering activities, civic service, extracurricular activities, academic performance and work experience. And it's always fun to be able to help a little on their education and congratulations to our 120 winners this year. And thanks to everyone for joining us today. And I know it's early, but it will be December before we talk to everyone. I hope everyone has a beginning, great holiday season as well, and thank you very much. Operator : Thank you all for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Robert Quast, Senior Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Robert Quast : Good morning. Thank you for joining us for Kroger\u2019s third quarter 2024 earnings call. I am joined today by Kroger\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Rodney McMullen; and Interim Chief Financial Officer, Todd Foley. Before we begin, I want to remind you that today\u2019s discussions will include forward-looking statements. We want to caution you that such statements are predictions and actual events or results can differ materially. A detailed discussion of the many factors that we believe may have a material effect on our business on an ongoing basis is contained in our SEC filings. The Kroger Company assumes no obligation to update that information. After our prepared remarks, we look forward to taking your questions. In order to cover a broad range of topics from as many of you as we can, we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up question if necessary. I will now turn the call over to Rodney. Rodney McMullen : Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we begin, I\u2019d like to provide an outline of our discussion topics this morning. I will start by sharing a recap of our third quarter performance and highlight how we continue to advance our go-to-market strategy, which powers our value creation model and drives long-term sustainable growth for our shareholders. Then Todd will cover our financial results for the third quarter and walk through updates to our full year guidance. And finally, I will close with some comments on our pending merger with Albertsons. Turning first to our performance, we delivered strong third quarter sales results led by our pharmacy and digital performance, which reflects the versatility of our model. Customer engagement remains strong. Our convenient, Seamless shopping experience, along with incredible customer value through low prices, personalized offers and great quality Our Brand products, drove growth in both total and loyal households. As we entered the last quarter of 2024, we are focused on providing the quality, Fresh and affordable products that make holiday celebrations special. Customer spending habits continue adjusting to current macroeconomic factors. As inflation normalizes, our premium and mainstream households are feeling more confident and are returning to their pre-pandemic shopping patterns more quickly. Mainstream households are the primary driver of our positive customer engagement trends. While overall consumer sentiment remains low, expectations are improving, which positions us well for the holidays and into next year. As we said, near-term, some customers are managing macroeconomic uncertainty. Spending from budget-conscious households remain under pressure, as the effects of multiyear inflation and higher interest rates have had a larger impact on these households. Therefore, we expect it will take longer for these households to fill the benefits of economic improvement. Kroger is delivering on its longstanding commitment to provide customers with the value they are seeking. We are helping customers save in multiple ways, including competitive shelf prices and loyalty discounts, personalized offers, fuel rewards and an expanded multi-tier Our Brands portfolio. Digital offers are an important way we deliver savings to customers and engagement continues to grow. With 5% more digital offer clips so far this year and that has led to 14% more savings for Kroger customers. We are always creating additional ways for our customers to save. This quarter, we celebrated and thanked our customers with a Customer Appreciation Week, offering new great deals, and to help our customers enjoy a memorable Thanksgiving, we lowered the price of Thanksgiving meals for the third consecutive year, by creating a meal bundle that served a group of 10 people for less than $5 per person. We are focused on executing our go-to-market strategy to deliver a differentiated customer experience through our focus areas of Fresh, Our Brands, Personalization and Seamless. We appreciate our associates\u2019 continued efforts to elevate the customer experience and bringing this strategy to life by improving on our key priorities of Full, Fresh & Friendly again this quarter. I would now like to cover how we are enhancing our go-to-market strategy. We are seeing long runways for growth in many areas of our strategy, starting with Fresh. Customers connect strongly to our Fresh for Everyone brand promise, which is a key differentiator for Kroger. Improvements across the supply chain as part of our end-to-end Fresh initiative are increasing days of freshness. For example, bagged salads now offer customers more than seven days of freshness. Customers are noticing and it has led to identical sales in produce of more than 3% this quarter. In addition, we constantly evaluate new ways to apply data and technology to provide an even better Fresh experience and deliver more days of freshness for our customers. One of the ways we are doing this is through recent implementation of RFID-embedded labels on bakery items. These labels provide us with greater insights into our Fresh inventory, resulting in consistently fresher items and higher in-stock levels. We have seen encouraging results, including higher sales, in locations and categories where we have piloted the RFID labels and we look forward to scaling this to more stores. Turning to Our Brands, I would like to step back and talk about the significant investments we have made in Our Brands and how those investments are delivering value to both customers and shareholders. For years, the grocery industry offered private label products with the primary goal of creating products at lower price points. Several years ago, we recognized an untapped opportunity for growth in these products and envisioned a future where our private label products would match or exceed the innovation, quality and recognition of national brands, which is why we coined the phrase, Our Brands. Guided by that vision, our teams built distinct and recognizable brands that our customers want and love, providing more value and meeting unique product needs that national brands cannot fill. Recently, we focused in on refining Our Brand architecture to optimize the portfolio and ensure each brand plays a unique role on the shelf. The successful addition of Smart Way, our new opening price point brand, played an important role in rounding out our multi-tiered portfolio and offering an attractive alternative to national brands at every price point. The next phase of the work involved refreshing designs and packaging, enhancing brand equity, and reinforcing quality and improving the shopability. For example, to reinforce our longstanding guarantee of quality and freshness, we are placing guarantees on labels across our Kroger branded products. Innovation remains a driving force for Our Brands\u2019 growth. We utilize our data and insights to understand customer trends and meet increasing demands by consistently introducing new items to our portfolio with a focus on growth areas, including free-from, organic, and multicultural. This innovation enables us to differentiate ourselves from both national brands and other private label brands, creating destination items that help build customer loyalty. Our manufacturing capabilities will continue to be an important advantage for Our Brands. With oversight over the quality and the supply, we can develop unique and differentiated products while keeping costs low, allowing us to pass the savings to customers while preserving our ability to grow margins, a true win-win for customers and Kroger. This quarter, Our Brands continue to deliver strong financial results, which Todd will cover in more detail. Next, to Personalization. Our Kroger Plus program provides our loyal customers access to savings and rewards that in turn drive traffic to our Seamless experience. As customers become more engaged, we gain deeper insights into customer trends while creating the data that enables us to grow Kroger Precision Marketing and deliver more effective promotions and relevant product recommendations. We are working to grow Boost, the next level of our loyalty program, through new benefits and this quarter we announced the addition of Disney+, Hulu or ESPN+ streaming benefits with Boost annual memberships. Turning to Seamless, digital sales grew 11%, driven by an increase in both households and traffic. Within digital, delivery sales grew at 18% and continues to outpace other channels. Boost is one of the important ways we are increasing e-commerce penetration, providing customers an affordable membership model for free delivery. Increasing e-commerce penetration is important to our model, as households who shop with us digitally and are in our stores are our most loyal customers and increase retail media monetization opportunities as well. As our digital business grows, particularly in our delivery network, it continues to have a larger impact on our financial results. Improving profitability is a key priority and becoming even more important to our financial model. Over nearly a decade, we made significant investments in our digital capabilities, building out our own properties, creating distribution channels in both pickup and delivery, investing in automation, enhancing Personalization and introducing an industry-leading retail media network. While each of these capabilities required significant investments, we now have a unique digital experience that our customers enjoy. Moving forward, we are committed to growing volumes, utilizing automation, and introducing new technology that will create efficiency gains while helping us narrow the profitability gap between online and in-store. Narrowing that gap will generate meaningful operating margin benefits and help drive shareholder value over the next several years. By executing our go-to-market strategy, we are building loyalty, increasing customer engagement and creating more growth opportunities, first with alternative profit businesses, which had another solid quarter. Kroger Precision Marketing continued to deliver the most significant growth from our alternative profit businesses. Next, in Health & Wellness, as the pharmacy industry continues to transform, Kroger has a unique opportunity to play a bigger role in helping patients live healthier lives while growing our share of the industry. We are excited about this area of the business and its performance. This quarter demonstrates we can grow this business profitably in a way that supports our customers to live healthier lives. Sales and profitability this quarter were well ahead of last year, led by growth in both GLP-1s and vaccines. Our strong growth in vaccines reflect patient trust in Kroger to vaccinate them and their families during the start of the cold and flu season, the peak quarter of the year for vaccinations. Our Health & Wellness teams did an excellent job this quarter in building awareness around our vaccine capabilities, growing share, and administrating significantly more vaccines this year versus a year ago. These helped offset the product mix pressures from GLP-1s. Our vaccine efforts are leading to new patient scripts, which is important as these customers are more likely to become loyal households and spend more across the store. We appreciate our associates for their continued efforts to elevate the customer experience by delivering on our key priorities of Full, Fresh & Friendly. Team consistency leads to a better customer experience and we are excited about another quarter of improvement in retention. Our focus on retention reflects a holistic strategy, including investments in wages and benefits, as well as enhancing the associate experience through training, technology and career development opportunities. With that, I will hand it over to Todd to take you through our third quarter financial results. Todd? Todd Foley : Thanks, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger\u2019s third quarter results reflect the durability of our model with strong pharmacy results that helped offset lower fuel profitability as we cycled strong fuel results from a year ago. As we head into the final quarter of the year, we are narrowing the ranges on our identical sales without fuel, adjusted FIFO operating profit and adjusted EPS guidance. The strength of our model gives us confidence in our ability to deliver on this full year guidance. Before I walk through our third quarter financial results, I would like to start off by covering a couple of items from the quarter that affected our financial results. First, during the third quarter, we finalized the sale of our Kroger Specialty Pharmacy business for $464 million. The sale reduced total company sales in the third quarter by approximately $340 million, compared to the same period last year, and annualized sales will be approximately $3 billion lower going forward. KSP was a low-margin business. As a result, the sale of the business increased both Kroger\u2019s gross margin and operating general and administrative costs as a rate of sales. It had no material effect on operating profit. Second, on a year-over-year basis, the combined hurricane season and port strike had approximately a 20-basis-point favorable impact on sales as customers stocked up in anticipation of these events. These events had an unfavorable impact on OG&A. Together, this did not have a material impact on total operating profit. I\u2019ll now take you through our third quarter financial results. We achieved identical sales without fuel growth of 2.3%. As Rodney mentioned earlier, identical sales without fuel were led by strong pharmacy and digital sales. We\u2019re also encouraged by the continuation of positive customer metric trends, including increases in total and loyal households. Our Brands had a strong quarter, with sales outpacing national brands again this quarter, led by mid-single-digit growth in our most premium brand, Private Selection. Customers continue to demand premium products, but at the same time are looking for value. Our Private Selection brand is a perfect solution by offering our customers premium quality at an attractive price. These results demonstrate the breadth of Our Brands portfolio and the ability to meet customers\u2019 needs for quality and value. Digital sales delivered another quarter of double-digit growth, led by 18% growth in delivery solutions, driven by our customer fulfillment centers. The CFCs are offering customers a superior digital experience with excellent in-stocks, fresh items and a white-glove on-time delivery. CFC growth was driven by a significant increase in households and trips, as well as an increase in basket size. Our third quarter identical sales without fuel results were affected by the Boar\u2019s Head recalls that began in the second quarter. We acted quickly, with the safety of our customers in mind, as soon as we became aware of the situation. Boar\u2019s Head is a strategic supplier with brand-loyal customers that are an important driver of our deli sales. As a result, some customers have temporarily migrated away from the category. It will take some time for those customers to resume their prior purchasing behavior and we expect this to remain a headwind to sales in the near term. The unfavorable sales effect from Boar\u2019s Head this quarter was largely offset by the favorable sales impact from the hurricane and port strike. Turning to margins, gross margin was 22.9% of sales and our FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased 51 basis points compared to last year and was ahead of expectations. The increase in rate was primarily attributable to the sale of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy, Our Brands performance and lower strength, partially offset by lower pharmacy margins. The result reflected Kroger\u2019s ability to improve margin while being competitive on price and helping customers manage their budgets. The OG&A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items, increased 22 basis points, driven by the sale of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy and increased incentive plan costs, partially offset by the continued execution of cost savings initiatives. Excluding the sale of Kroger Specialty Pharmacy, fuel and adjustment items, our OG&A rate to sales would have been nearly flat year-over-year, demonstrating that our model can leverage expenses when we achieve our long-term ID sales without fuel goal of 2% to 4%. This is made possible by a relentless focus on productivity and cost savings initiatives, which remain an essential part of our model. These initiatives are focused on simplification and utilizing technology to enhance the associate experience without impacting the customer experience. This quarter, we launched a new, internally developed, generative AI-powered sell-through tool, which helps us better manage inventory in both Fresh and center store departments through real-time insights tracking sales and shipments. This enables our teams to increase freshness on shelves and prioritize sell-through, optimizing both sales and margins. Looking ahead, we plan to further enhance the AI capabilities on this platform by extending into improved forecasting and end-to-end inventory management. During the third quarter, we recorded a LIFO charge of $4 million, compared to a charge of $29 million for the same period last year, due to lower expected year-over-year inflation. Adjusted FIFO operating profit was $1.02 billion and adjusted EPS was $0.98 per diluted share, an increase of 3% compared to last year. Fuel is an important part of our strategy. Fuel rewards, through our Kroger Plus program, help build customer loyalty. Fuel sales were significantly lower this quarter compared to last year, attributable to a lower average retail price per gallon. Fuel profitability was also meaningfully behind a year ago, as a result of fewer gallons sold and lower cents per gallon margin. I wanted to provide a brief update on inflation, as it remains a topic of interest for many investors. Inflation was down slightly in the third quarter, compared with the second quarter, but remains around 1%. We expect inflation to remain consistent in the fourth quarter. I would now like to provide a brief update on associates and labor relations. During the third quarter, we ratified new labor agreements for Dillon\u2019s Columbia, Missouri clerks, Central Division, Ottawa and Streeter clerks, Northern Illinois meat clerks, Fred Meyer Portland retail stores and the Foods Co. contract in Northern California, all covering nearly 13,000 associates. We respect associates\u2019 right to collectively bargain. We\u2019re also communicating to local unions that coming to the table with proposals that do not balance investing in associates with keeping groceries affordable for our customers and supporting a growing and profitable business model are untenable. These proposals stand in the way of operating our business in a way that ensures job security and advancement opportunities for associates. Turning to cash flow, Kroger continues to generate strong adjusted free cash flow through consistent operating results. Free cash flow generation is an important part of our model and is enabling us to invest in our business for growth. At the end of the third quarter, Kroger\u2019s net total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.21, compared to our target range of 2.3 to 2.5. Our strengthened balance sheet provides us flexibility to pursue growth and enhance shareholder value. We continue to take a disciplined approach to deploying capital, prioritizing the highest growth opportunities that strengthen our business and deliver solid returns for our shareholders. We\u2019re committed to maintaining our investment-grade debt rating, increasing our dividend over time subject to board approval, and returning excess capital to shareholders when we are able to do so. I would now like to provide some additional color on our outlook for the rest of the year. After delivering solid third quarter results, we\u2019re narrowing the ranges of identical sales without fuel, adjusted FIFO operating profit and adjusted EPS guidance. Additionally, we have updated our guidance for adjusted effective tax rate and expect it to be 22.5%. We now expect identical sales without fuel for the year to be in the range of 1.2% to 1.5%. With quarter-to-date trends signaling, we will be near the midpoint of this range. Identical sales without fuel results year-to-date have largely been in line with our expectations, with Q3 being slightly ahead of expectations due to favorable effects from the hurricanes, the port strike and strong vaccine growth during the peak season for immunizations. Our expectations for fourth quarter identical sales without fuel are consistent with our forecast at the beginning of the year. We expect Q4 identical sales to remain strong, but sequentially lower than third quarter, partially due to the cycling of weather benefits from the fourth quarter of 2023 that are not built into our current forecast for Q4 2024. We now expect adjusted FIFO operating profit to be in the range of $4.6 billion to $4.7 billion and adjusted net earnings per diluted share is expected to be in the range of $4.35 to $4.45. Looking to next year, we are in the process of finalizing our 2025 business plan, while we still have many unknowns, we do expect Kroger to deliver FIFO operating profit growth on a standalone basis. During our fourth quarter earnings call, we plan to share our full year 2025 outlook in more detail. In closing, we are happy to deliver another quarter of strong results, which reflect the resilience of our value creation model. While macroeconomic conditions remain uncertain, our model has multiple levers which enable us to navigate any environment, including grocery, Health & Wellness, fuel and alternative profit businesses. This gives us flexibility in the ways we create shareholder value and confidence in our ability to generate attractive and sustainable returns for shareholders. I will now turn the call back to Rodney. Rodney McMullen : Thanks, Todd. Before I open it up to Q&A, I\u2019d like to speak briefly about our pending merger with Albertsons. First, I would like to express my appreciation for our associates and their incredible commitment. It has been a long journey and our associates have done an excellent job serving customers and running the day-to-day operations of our business while also preparing for the merger. I would like to extend a special thanks to those who supported the litigation in federal and state courts, both the associates who testified and the teams who prepared a compelling case about the meaningful and measurable benefits of the merger. Our teams are ready to ensure a Seamless transition for our customers and associates from day one. It is exciting to see the complementary strengths of both Kroger and Albertsons organizations, and we look forward to combining these strengths to provide customers with an even better experience. As we await the court rulings and the regulatory challenges to the merger, we remain confident in the facts and the strengths of our position. The retail industry continues to be more competitive and we know how our customers shop. Every day they are making decisions on where to eat and where to buy their groceries. They shop at a wide range of competitors, from Costco to Amazon to Dollar Stores, and they eat at restaurants. They shop digitally and brick-and-mortar. And as I\u2019ve said before, we remain committed to closing the merger because it will provide meaningful and measurable benefits for customers, for associates and for communities across the country, and we look forward to bringing these commitments to life. Regardless of the outcome of the trials, Kroger is operating from a position of strength and we are optimistic about our future. Our business is more diverse than ever and our value creation model provides us with multiple ways to drive sustainable growth. Our strong free cash flow and strengthened balance sheet provides us with the ability to invest in our business and enhance shareholder value. With that, Todd and I look forward to taking your questions. Because we are still in litigation, we will not be taking questions on the merger this morning. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Simeon Gutman : Good morning, Rodney, Todd. My question is on the P&L for 2024. If you take out the extra week lap and then you pull out some of the merger-related costs, the big ones, it looks like the core business is growing pretty nicely on EBIT and really nicely, potentially mid-single, even high single-digit percentage, and that\u2019s despite lower fuel profitability and the environment\u2019s been pretty tough. So first, is that a fair characterization and is it mixing the way you would have thought between the core business and the alternative? Thanks. Todd Foley : Great question, Simeon. Thanks for that and I think that\u2019s a fair read on how you\u2019ve described it. We were obviously very happy with the results that we\u2019ve seen coming from not only the core business but inclusive of pharmacy, particularly pleased with the results we saw in pharmacy, you heard Rodney talk about today. So despite that lever in fuel giving us a headwind this quarter, we were pleased with the core growth coming from the core business and see that continuing. The mix relative to alternative and core business, I think the growth expectations that we have around the alternative profit business are relatively consistent to what we expected to see and so I think that those continue to be as balanced as we expected going into the quarter. Rodney McMullen : And longer term, as everyone knows, the alternative business -- profit businesses will continue to see a great opportunity and the margins on that business is meaningfully higher than the supermarket business, and the whole flywheel between our brick-and-mortar business and our Seamless business pickup and delivery is the engine behind driving that continuation there, which we\u2019re very excited about. Todd Foley : That\u2019s a great call, Rodney. We saw the digital growth again at low double-digit growth, which is an important part of the growth that you talked about, Simeon. And that, again, when you talk about mix in our business and our omnichannel, that low double-digit growth is right on what we expected and helps drive both the core business and the alternative profit as Rodney described. Simeon Gutman : And the one follow-up, this is more towards a comment Rodney made. All year, we talked about the mainstream, the premium and the lower end. It felt like there may have been an inflection whereas the mainstream has been resilient and the premium has been healthy. I thought your comments today on mainstream inflected a little more positively. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s reading too much in. Lower income sounds about the same. Curious if that\u2019s fair. Rodney McMullen : Yeah. The mainstream customers certainly performed, connected with us better in the third quarter than the second quarter. How much of that is driven because of things we did and how much they\u2019re just feeling better, we don\u2019t know. Now they\u2019re telling us they feel better. And certainly customers that are on a budget continue to be under a lot of strain and the accumulation of inflation and other aspects and higher interest rates continue to affect them more. And I think the other thing that\u2019s always important to remember is, that customer in many cases are starting out in careers and things and they don\u2019t have as many physical assets on a house or a little bit of savings and those things, and those -- inflation obviously affects that person a little harder than others. Thanks, Simeon. Operator : Our next question comes from Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer. Rupesh, your line is now open. Please go ahead. Rupesh Parikh : Good morning and thank you for taking my question. So just going back to your guidance, so you did narrow the operating profit ratio to the lower end of the range for the full year. So just curious what\u2019s driving that. Rodney McMullen : Yeah. Todd, I\u2019ll let you start. Todd Foley : Yeah. Well, with one quarter left, Rupesh, we wanted to try to narrow the range because there should be less variability in our expectations. When you look at the sales part of the guidance down at 1.2% to 1.5%, I think, that\u2019s pretty consistent with what we\u2019ve been thinking for the year. The midpoint on that range is a tick higher than I think what we had been thinking before. And frankly, when you look at where we expect to be in Q4, I think that\u2019s right on how we\u2019ve been thinking about it all year relative to all of that. Q3 actually is the one that was really strong and we talked about -- Rodney talked about the pharmacy and the digital growth there, particularly in the vaccine space. We were really pleased. We\u2019ve been working hard to grow our vaccine business and we saw that throughout the quarters early in this year, but with Q3 being that key vaccine, the Super Bowl season for vaccines, we were really pleased to see that that growth continue and that it paid off in that point in time. So that\u2019s where we saw Q3 being really strong and that Q4 guidance being really what we expected. When you look at it on the EPS side of our guidance through past again, narrow the range there. We took a nickel off the top side and the bottom side and really that midpoint of the range is pretty consistent with where we\u2019ve been thinking about it for the year. As we think about that range and some of the key factors for that range in the fourth quarter, a couple of key things that we\u2019re keeping an eye on. One is weather. We alluded to it in our prepared comments. There were several meaningful weather events a year ago that drove some benefits and we just don\u2019t forecast weather on a forward-looking basis. So if we see the number and magnitude of weather events in the fourth quarter this year, I think that would be something that could push us towards the higher end of that range. And then the other one is fuel. And certainly we -- fuel tends to be pretty volatile and we\u2019ve seen that this year and really we have fuel expectations to be pretty in line with where they were last year. And frankly, from a gallon trend and from a $0.01 per gallon trend in the fourth quarter, we\u2019re pretty consistent sequentially from where we\u2019ve been performing over the last few periods. So if we have variance in the fuel profitability, either positive or negative, I think that could lean us towards the top or the bottom end of that range, respectively. Rodney McMullen : Todd said this, but I think it\u2019s important to just highlight it. If you look at the range for the year, fuel in the third quarter was a tougher quarter than what we expected it to be and that really relative to the top side. And the other thing that Todd mentioned, we don\u2019t budget weather because we just don\u2019t know. Obviously there\u2019s been some major storms, but those storms haven\u2019t been in places where we operate stores. So it really hasn\u2019t affected us so far. And generally that\u2019s a positive when we have weather because people eat at home as opposed to going to restaurants. Rupesh Parikh : Okay. And then my very quick follow-up question, just on the Boost membership, you added the Disney perk as well. Just overall, are you guys happy with the signups you\u2019re seeing and the retention with that program? Rodney McMullen : I would say we\u2019re very happy, but the thing that I guess I get more excited about is the potential, because it\u2019s an incredible value for customers and customers love it and we have a high renewal rate and a high NPS score. So our job is to continue to educate more customers on it. So I\u2019m really more excited about the opportunity going forward and the overall deeper connection with customers. So great question. Thanks, Rupesh. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Leah Jordan of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Leah Jordan : Good morning. Thank you for taking my question and thanks for the commentary on inflation this morning and how you\u2019re thinking about it in the fourth quarter. But as you plan with your vendors and seeing if you can add more color on how you\u2019re thinking about inflation into next year, what are you seeing across categories and hearing from those partners? Rodney McMullen : Yeah. No. A great question. Maybe still a little early to think about next year, but you think about where we were this year, obviously, coming into the year, we were coming out of that crazy disinflation that we had a year ago. And inflation has played out more or less the way we expected. It\u2019s maybe a little bit less than what we expected, but it\u2019s been relatively stable at just under 1%. Maybe even saw, I think, a slight step back in Q3 relative to Q2, which as we said, we expect to see for next year. As we look to next year at this point, looking at both some of the macro and governmental studies, as well as conversations with vendors. Again, it\u2019s still early to tell. And we might see a slight expansion to inflation next year, but really don\u2019t expect to see anything meaningfully different or inconsistent with what we\u2019re kind of seeing right now with inflation. Todd Foley : We are continuing to see CPGs be a little more aggressive on trade dollars, and over time, that obviously affects inflation a little bit as well. Leah Jordan : Great. Thank you. And I just wanted to follow-up on some of your Fresh initiatives. I know you\u2019ve been working on improving days of freshness in produce for a while, so great to see some improvement there. But it seems like the RFID tags within bakery is new to me. Just wanted more color there, what degree of lift are you seeing when you add that to the category? How many of your stores have it today and how should we think about the rollout over time? Rodney McMullen : Well, we are -- as I mentioned, we\u2019re testing it. We\u2019re happy with the initial result. The benefits are as much helping our associates be able to do their job a little bit easier. And it\u2019s too early -- it\u2019s early enough to be excited about the potential. It\u2019s too early to say this much we can budget in terms of what we would do. But the thing that we\u2019re excited about for our customers, it\u2019s helping us make sure we have fresher product for the customer and stay in stock better. And it\u2019s super exciting. We will look at other areas of the store to see what kind of opportunity it is. The cost per tag is still higher than we would like, so we still need to continue to work on focusing on the get the cost per tag down. But positive early results, really early in the process and excited about the potential. Thanks, Leah. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Ken Goldman : Hi. Thank you. I wanted to follow-up on the topic of next year. I appreciate it\u2019s too early for specifics and I\u2019m not asking for any numbers. But to Simeon\u2019s question, you agree that it\u2019s a fair read that the core underlying business is doing very well. I think those are the words, despite when you ex out the merger cost and the digital mix and fuel and so forth. And you talked a little bit about inflation being sort of steady and predictable and consistent in that low-single-digit range. Are there any other unusual tailwinds or headwinds that we should consider just directionally as we think about next year? Just trying to get a sense for what would kind of throw you off from having another reasonably good year. You did say that operating profit would be up, but you didn\u2019t kind of tell us how much and your longer term algo is 3% to 5%, of course? Rodney McMullen : And it would be way too early to tell you specifics, and obviously, we\u2019re waiting for the ruling on the merger, which will affect guidance as well. The other thing that I guess from a positive standpoint that I\u2019m excited about, in the third quarter, we opened or expanded the most number of stores that we\u2019ve done. I think it\u2019s actually in a quarter in seven years. And as you know, last year we talked about it that we will open more stores this year than we have in several years and we would expect to continue to open more stores. And so far, the stores that we\u2019ve opened, we\u2019re happy with the way they\u2019re connecting with customers and we\u2019re happy in terms of the volumes they\u2019re creating and the early read on the profitability of the stores as well. So over time, we would hope that that would continue to be a tailwind, and obviously, on Seamless, we continue to see that as really critical to our five-year or 10-year future to be awesome there and we still have a lot of work to do to make where we\u2019re indifferent, whether somebody shops with us online or in-store and we\u2019ll continue to put a lot of effort there. In terms of headwind, Todd, I\u2019ll let you add anything that you can think of. Todd Foley : I can\u2019t think of anything unusual headwinds or tailwinds as we sit here today, frankly Ken. But going into next year, part of what has us optimistic and feeling good about the strength of our value creation model is a lot of the momentum we have in the things that are in our high growth areas today. We\u2019ve talked about a lot of them already. It\u2019s pharmacy, it\u2019s our digital business, it\u2019s our alternative profit. And we have good momentum in those spaces and are executing on those. And from a headwind standpoint, we\u2019re going to continue to invest in the business. We\u2019re going to invest in price. You\u2019ve heard Rodney say it before. We assume every year is going to be more competitive than the last and that view hasn\u2019t changed. And so we\u2019ll continue to engage in customers, make sure we\u2019re delivering value to them by investing in price and investing in their shopping experience and we\u2019re committed to continue to invest in wages. So some of those are headwinds. They\u2019re just the parts of our model that is we deliver the value in our model through all their different value propositions. We\u2019re able to use that to invest in the business to keep the flywheel moving. Ken Goldman : Okay. Thank you for that. And then speaking about price investments, Rodney, you mentioned that CPGs continue to be a little bit more aggressive on trade dollars. Your largest competitor are in food retail. We\u2019ll see if the judges agree that it\u2019s a competitor or not, but your largest competitor in food retail had more kind of commentary last week or this week about how they would like to see more of those price investments from key vendors. Rodney, your tone, since I\u2019ve known you has always been more sort of agnostic about that. If investors -- if your vendors don\u2019t invest with that, you\u2019ll be happy to sell customers more private label. I\u2019m just curious where you stand in terms of, are you content with the level of price investment or are you more just sort of agnostic and saying, look, whatever our vendors want, it\u2019ll play out either way beneficially for you. Rodney McMullen : Yeah. I guess a little bit of both. The -- if you look at tonnage growth in CPGs, there\u2019s a lot of CPGs that cannot be satisfied with their tonnage growth. And I believe that trade dollars and being more aggressive on partnering with us to make sure the right customer gets access to those benefits is good long-term for the customer, a long-term benefit for both of us on tonnage. If they\u2019re not willing to do that, it really gets back to the comment that we talked about. Our Brands and Todd and I both mentioned it had a strong quarter, the profitability of Our Brands is several hundred basis points higher than national brand. And if the CPGs are willing to continue to give up share to Our Brands we\u2019re okay with that because what we find is once a customer tries Our Brand, the repeat rate of customers coming back is incredibly high because what they find is they have -- there\u2019s no compromise on quality and they have a great value for the money. So, at the end of the day, the customer wins when they buy Our Brands, but it really is we try to run a business where the customer decides what they want to buy as opposed to forcing them to buy something. Thanks Ken. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ed Kelly of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Ed Kelly : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Rodney McMullen : Good morning. Ed Kelly : I\u2019m curious about the gross margin. You\u2019ve had a couple good quarters on the gross margin front. I think you admit this quarter was better than expected. How are you thinking about gross margin in Q4 and then, even like into, I don\u2019t know, you\u2019re not going to get next year, but sort of like the outlook for the gross margin. And I\u2019m talking like ex-Spec Pharma divestiture and maybe just talk about the puts and takes around that? Todd Foley : Yeah. No. Great question, Ed. And I think you hit on a key part of thinking about it excluding KSP. We talked about, it was a strong quarter in gross margin and about half of that year-over-year benefit was a result of the divestiture. But the other piece of it really came, we highlighted both of, Rodney, layers and what Rodney was just talking about, what was our growth in Our Brands, where we continue to have Our Brands sales growth outpacing national brands and that is always going to drive solid margin expansion. And so that\u2019s certainly what we saw again in the third quarter, very similar to what we saw in the second and then shrink had another nice quarter. So we\u2019ve got cautiously optimistic on the progress we\u2019re making there, but we are making progress on the shrink space that really helped us in the third. As we look to the fourth, I think, excluding KSP, I think overall we\u2019ll probably be slightly favorable in the fourth, reflecting KSP when you, when you pull that out, I think, we\u2019ll probably be relatively flat on that relative to some of the puts and takes. Again, if we over index in things like Our Brands and whatnot, but we may be a little bit favorable, but overall, I think we\u2019ll be, we\u2019ll be relatively consistent relatively flat year-over-year on the margins in Q4. Rodney McMullen : I totally agree with everything Todd said. And Todd said the big pieces, I would also add a couple of smaller pieces that\u2019s helping on gross margin that should continue is if you look at our warehouse and transportation costs, continue to make some progress there and the customer continues to buy more value-added product and Fresh continues to grow as well. So those are things that help on mix and in addition to things that Todd talked about. Ed Kelly : And just to Rodney, a quick follow-up, this one\u2019s for you. And you kind of hinted at it or talked about it, but Albertsons would be a transformational deal. How do you feel about Kroger\u2019s position, if the deal is rejected and do you need to hunt for something else more transformational or is it just simply more prudent to double down on what you have and, and reward shareholders for their patients with returning capital? Rodney McMullen : Yeah. It\u2019s a great question. If you look at the balance sheet capacity that we have, there\u2019s probably no -- nothing else that would be transformational that would use the balance sheet capacity that we would have. So I don\u2019t know that we would be out there trying to find what\u2019s the next Albertsons. As you know and you just said it, we track -- we\u2019ve always made sure that we don\u2019t need to do mergers to make our business successful and that was one of the reasons that we\u2019ve always been proud of what Kroger has done. We\u2019re super excited about Albertsons and the potential, and we believe we will be able to add a ton of value for giving customers better value. The people there will be able to provide security and grow our business and create additional career opportunities and support communities, but if it doesn\u2019t happen we\u2019ll continue to go on. As you know, we always will continue to look at how ways to grow the business. Mergers is always one of those ways of growing the business. But we try to make sure that we only do a merger when it makes sense, and we\u2019re not chasing something and we won\u2019t get in a position where we are having to chase something. So great question, and thanks, Ed. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Lasser of UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Michael Lasser : Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my question. As of the second quarter, Kroger had made a point in its presentation that it was on track to deliver more than 20% media growth this year and that line was removed this quarter. So is it right to interpret that the media growth, which is an important driver of the alternative revenue stream is starting to slow, perhaps, as there are more adverts -- net more platforms for advertisers to choose and direct its advertising dollars. And if that\u2019s the case, how does Kroger accelerate that element of its algorithm in order to support the long-term outlook for the business? Todd Foley : Yeah. Let me start there, Michael. Thanks for the question. It\u2019s a good call. We do still expect to see our retail media growth being that in that 20% range for the year. It\u2019s still a fast growing part of our business and the outcomes that we\u2019re seeing continue to demonstrate that we\u2019re well positioned for that growth. As we look at those CPGs that are advertising with us, we see the outsized return on ad spend that they\u2019re generating and so that\u2019s why I say we\u2019re able to demonstrate and we\u2019re seeing those results. And not coincidentally, the sales for those CPGs at Kroger are strong and so I think the proof points continue to be there, but as you say, there\u2019s a proliferation of options as everybody\u2019s kind of got their own flavor of what this is. So I think we just need to continue to demonstrate that the CPGs, because I think the proof will be in the results. Rodney McMullen : Todd\u2019s last point to me, and if CPGs are listening in, that\u2019s the only reason why I\u2019m adding on top. The CPGs that increased spending the most had the highest tonnage growth with us, which to me is, it shows you the power of our platform and Todd said it, I just wanted to double down on it. Michael Lasser : Okay. And my follow-up question is, what do you need to drive -- what do you need to happen in order to drive The Kroger to achieve the sales piece of its long-term algorithm in 2025? This year, there\u2019s been a contribution from the GLP-1 drug, some storm-related spending, perhaps those won\u2019t be as meaningful contributors next year. So is it that you would be banking on A, market share stabilizing and is that realistic; and B, some acceleration in inflation to offset what had been driving some of the comp this year? Rodney McMullen : Yeah. We would not be dependent on inflation and it\u2019s really we continue to double down on the customer experience. And when we find that we improve the customer experience, our business follows that or the customer rewards us for that. And it\u2019s -- it really gets back to you\u2019ve heard us say it a million times Full, Fresh & Friendly. The other thing that we\u2019re increasingly supporting is allocating capital to growth areas and that would be storing, obviously, continuation of Seamless or online business continues to have outside growth and then specific projects that support cost reductions and sales opportunities. Todd Foley : Yeah. I agree, everything you said, Rodney, especially the storing that you hit on earlier as well. You mentioned GLP-1 and that certainly has been part of this year, but as we sit here today, I think we continue to expect to see growth in that area as more manufacturers get in the mix and the supply continues to become more available and more and more patients continue to utilize that drug. So I think we\u2019ll still see -- expect to see growth in the GLP-1 space as well for the -- at least near future, foreseeable future. Rodney McMullen : Thanks, Michael. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Partners. Your lines are open. Please go ahead. John Heinbockel : Hey, Rodney. Can you talk about the, you referenced in your release, the initiatives -- productivity initiatives on in-store order selection and how broadly is that rolled out? And when I think about how much you can take the cost per order down, can you take that down a double-digit from where we are today? Rodney McMullen : Over time, we would certainly expect to take it down double-digit from where we are today. And when I talk about over time, I\u2019m talking about over the next two years or three years and it\u2019s -- we still have a reasonable amount to roll it out. Now, as you, you followed Kroger long enough to know that we will start -- whenever we roll something out, we start with the biggest opportunity places first. So it\u2019s the highest volume locations and those kinds of things. The thing that I think is fascinating and exciting is, if you look at the fundamental things behind the software, we\u2019re learning that we can actually use that same technology in other areas of the business and I would hope that we\u2019ll continue to find those kinds of opportunities. So I feel confident and comfortable that certainly, well, double-digit type stuff of improvement. But our team\u2019s not going to be satisfied until they get to where it\u2019s indifferent, how somebody shops with us. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Montani of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Michael Montani : Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask first, did I miss the fuel CPG contribution for this quarter? Wondering if you could give some added color there and then just had a follow-up? Todd Foley : Yeah. Thanks, Michael. We don\u2019t typically -- we stopped a few quarters ago, given in details around CPG. You did catch on to the point that I think that, that Rodney brought out that both gallons and CPG were down in the third quarter. Again, some of the volatility in fuel, but as we looked at the fourth quarter relative to our expectations versus a year ago we think fuel will be a little bit -- our expectation is that fuel will be a little bit more stable year-over-year in Q4 and that\u2019s supported by some of the trends that we\u2019ve seen over the last few periods in both gallons and, and margins. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Dickerson of Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Robert Dickerson : Great. Thanks so much. Rodney, I know you set up front and it seems like consumer sentiment is still low, but maybe there are some green shoots, maybe it\u2019s improving a little bit. So I\u2019m just wondering kind of as you got through the Thanksgiving holiday and then as we\u2019re kind of real time in the current holiday season, like you have -- have you seen any incremental almost like sequential traffic improvement in the actual retail stores? Rodney McMullen : We feel good about where we are. The thing, I guess, I would say that we still don\u2019t quite under, it\u2019ll take time is there\u2019s five less shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. So we feel good about where we are. We\u2019re tracking a little bit better than where we thought we would be. But we still are cautious because of the five less shopping days and how does that play out? And as you mentioned, we are seeing the customer, most of the customers are starting to feel a little bit more relaxed and comfortable in terms of where they stand and what\u2019s coming -- what -- how things look going forward. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Jacob Aiken-Phillips of Melius Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Jacob Aiken-Phillips: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to go back to inflation a little bit. So you showed that you were able to kind of leverage SG&A given like flat comps excluding KSP. How do we think about that relationship going forward in terms of wage inflation and wage investment? And then also with tariffs, we\u2019re of the view that it could be a self-fulfilling prophecy in terms of like people buying stuff and causing inflation, even if there aren\u2019t actually tariffs happening. I just wanted your thoughts on that. Todd Foley : Yeah. I\u2019ll start with the wage inflation -- the wage investments. It\u2019s a great question. We\u2019ve talked a lot about how important it is for us to invest in our associates because they\u2019re so critical delivering our customer experience. But we will continue to balance those wage investments with the other profitability enhancement items that we say. So in any inflationary environment and in any sales leverage environment, we\u2019ve demonstrated that our model enables us to pull the levers to be able to balance those wage increases accordingly over time. So given the comments that we said with fairly balanced inflation, we think we\u2019ll be able to leverage our SG&A including wage investments. Rodney, I don\u2019t know if you want to comment on the tariffs. Rodney McMullen : Yeah. Tariffs for us, first of all, the effect on us is probably a little less than most companies and we buy product internationally, but it\u2019s pretty modest. If you look in the Fresh departments, it\u2019s less than 20% of the stuff. If you look in the center store, it\u2019s a fraction of that. So we would see the tariffs affecting others generally more than us and we feel like we\u2019ll be able to manage whatever is done because our competitors will have to deal with the same thing. Thanks Jacob. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Chuck Cerankosky : Good morning, everyone. Rodney, you mentioned that the mainstream and premium customers were pretty close to spending how they had been before COVID. But there also is from what I can observe, the groups that are more likely to be going to restaurants, which seem to be doing fairly well right now. How do you sort of offset that with Kroger\u2019s prepared food offerings and maybe what changes are you making in those categories? Rodney McMullen : Well, first of all, we believe that that\u2019s a huge opportunity. Our market share -- half of meals bought at a restaurant is consumed in a car or at home. Actually, I think it\u2019s a little over half. So we see that as a huge opportunity. I would say we\u2019re trying a lot of different things. We have -- we\u2019re working with a couple of outside companies trying to help us there. But to me it\u2019s more of -- in the future we have a bigger opportunity than we\u2019ve been able to unlock so far and we believe it\u2019s a huge opportunity because what we\u2019ve found is that a customer can buy a meal from us and it\u2019s usually the cost is one-third to one-fourth versus going out to a restaurant. So it\u2019s -- for us, it\u2019s a great opportunity, but we\u2019re just scratching the surface. Operator : Thank you. At this time, we will take no further questions. So I\u2019ll hand back to Rodney for any further remarks. Rodney McMullen : Thank you for all the questions. And as always, we have a lot of our associates listening in. First, I would like to send our thoughts and prayers to those impacted by the recent hurricanes. I would also like to take a moment to express my gratitude and appreciation for our dedicated team of associates, especially during this time. They just did amazing things on supporting communities. And as you know, our stores are vital to each community we serve and during these types of times, our customers rely on us to provide them with food and other essential items. And I am so proud of our associates who have stepped up to be there for our customers, communities and each other. Thank you for everything that you do for Kroger and our customers. And thank you for everyone joining us today. We wish you a very happy holiday season, Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. Operator : Thank you all for joining today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect your lines.",
