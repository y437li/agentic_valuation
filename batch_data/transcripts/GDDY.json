At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the GoDaddy Q1 2015 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Ms. Marta Nichols, VP, Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Marta Nichols : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for GoDaddy's First Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. With me today are Blake Irving, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Wagner, Chief Operating and Financial Officer. Blake and Scott have some prepared remarks which will follow with a Q&A session. On today's call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, including bookings, adjusted EBITDA and unlevered free cash flow. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalent may be found in the presentation posted to our Investor Relations website at www.gddy.com or on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC with today's earnings release. The matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, May 12, 2015, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. With that, I'll turn the call over to Blake. Blake Irving : Thanks, Marta. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us for our first public earnings call. I'd like to extend a warm welcome to all of our new shareholders. We're grateful for your interest and your confidence in our vision, our strategy and our business model. We delivered a strong first quarter, and we look forward to continuing to deliver for our customers in the months and the years ahead. Since our founding 18 years ago, GoDaddy has been a trusted partner and a champion for organizations of all sizes in their quest to build successful online ventures. GoDaddy's vision is to radically shift the global economy towards small business by helping individuals easily start, confidently grow and successfully run their own ventures. The passion and dedication of our customers inspire our employees every single day. Our more than 13 million customers want simple powerful solutions, and they want someone in their corner to help them perform online and that's what we do. We offer them a growing suite of simple, yet powerful, cloud-based products built on a single global technology platform and supported by empathetic, consultative customer care, real people that are here to talk with and help our customers every day. Our strategy and model have yielded a large high-growth business with strong cash flow, which serves a massive global market with growing needs. At the end of Q1, we've grown to serve nearly 13.1 million customers, an increase of more than 1 million customers versus a year ago. Our average revenue per user, or ARPU, rose nearly 10% to $115 in the first quarter. Bookings grew 13.7% to $499 million, and together, our strong customer and ARPU growth drove our revenue up 17.5% to $376 million. Our adjusted EBITDA jumped 17.8% to $94 million in the first quarter, producing an adjusted EBITDA margin of 25%. We've been particularly focused on expanding internationally and have grown to serve a total of 37 countries and 17 languages over the last 18 months. We ended the first quarter with more than 59 million domains under management, and that's roughly 21% of the world's domains. Now I see several big themes in our recent accomplishments and our results. First, we're continuing to innovate and expand our product portfolio; second, we're delivering strong financial performance and growth; third is the conscious evolution of our brand and it's showing real benefits. Let's run through each of those briefly. On my first point about expanding our product portfolio, we demonstrated continued innovation in recent months in all 3 of our major revenue lines. In Domains, we recently delivered our 300th top-level domain extension and acquired 200,000 domains, continuing to expand our inventory to offer the broadest choice of possible naming options to our customers. In Hosting and Presence, we recently launched GoDaddy Pro to a strong reception, with well over 10,000 web professionals signed up, and we've been rolling out new web presence products like our Online Store builder and our new SEO product as well. In Business Applications, we recently launched GoDaddy Email Marketing, or GEM, built by our recently acquired Mad Mimi team to help our customers market to their customers. All of these products and services demonstrate our focus on delivering truly distinctive products on a single technology platform, all wrapped with world-class customer care. We continue to serve our customers in a unique and special way, with products, technology and care all around the world. These capabilities, our breadth of products, the strength of our platform and our care team, allow us to grow with our customers as their ideas grow. For example, Candis Jones of thejonesmarket.com, who rang the bell for us at the NYSE, first used GoDaddy's Online Store builder to create a simple, elegant online storefront for selling her handmade jewelry and later added our bookkeeping software to easily create invoices, track her sales and expenses and made tax filing easy for her. On my second point about our financial performance, as you can see in our Q1 results, and as Scott's going to discuss in more detail, we're growing revenue across all 3 of our business lines while continuing to invest in innovation and growth, delivering strong cash flows and margins. And third, on our brand. We continue to drive our brand evolution with a laser focus on showcasing what we do and who we do it for, our customers. Our Super Bowl ad continued to honor the tenacity and dedication of small business owners and according to Adweek, delivered the highest brand lift of any advertiser in the 2015 Super Bowl. On April 1, a group of our customers stood with me on the podium at the New York Stock Exchange and our online store customer, Candis Jones, who I just mentioned, rang the bell on our behalf. More recently, we announced that this will be the last season of our NASCAR sponsorship. While NASCAR has been a powerful branding platform for us in the U.S., we're diversifying our marketing spend with a focus on international markets and a more personalized data-driven marketing approach. We believe our intense focus on our customers and their needs for easy-to-use products delivered on a single global technology platform, delivered with exceptional customer care, this rare combination of products, technology and care will continue to differentiate GoDaddy and produce strong financial results going forward. Now let me turn the call over to Scott to talk about the financials in more detail. Scott? Scott Wagner : Thanks, Blake, and let me add my warm welcome to everyone as well. As Blake said, we feel great about what we delivered in the first quarter. We grew customers more than 9% over the last year, ending Q1 with approximately 13.1 million paying customers. Our average revenue per user, or ARPU, grew nearly 10% on an annualized basis year-over-year to $115, up from $105 a year ago. As Blake said, bookings grew 13.7%, and solid growth in both customers and ARPU drove revenue up 17.5%, with each of our 3 product lines Domains, Hosting and Presence and Business Applications growing at double-digit rates. Now we report and measure our top line in 2 ways : bookings and revenue. Our bookings represent the cash we collect when a customer purchases a product. We typically collect the full purchase price at the time of sale and then recognize GAAP revenue ratably over the term of a customer contract, which averages a bit more than a year. Over the past 5 years on average, we've generated 90% of our revenue each year from customers already in our base at the start of the year. While we experience annual customer churn of less than 15%, the 85% of customers who do stay with us typically spend more, which translates into limited annual revenue churn. In short, we have a very stable revenue model. I'll briefly run through the results in each of our 3 revenue lines. First, on Domains. We continued to extend our market leadership with Domains revenue up 10.4% in Q1 to $199 million. The domain market continues to grow on a secular basis as more businesses and individuals claim and name their ideas online. While Domains revenue continues to expand for us, it now contributes about 53% of revenue, down from 56% a year ago as our other 2 revenue lines grow faster. Our objective in Domains is pretty simple. It's to enable our customers to easily find the perfect name wherever they are in the world, and there are several ways that we're working to make that happen. First, we've continued to expand our domain inventory. With more than 300 gTLDs and ccTLDs now available through GoDaddy and over 760,000 new gTLD domains under management since we began launching the new gTLD program in early '14, including .guru, .club, .nyc and hundreds more names. Second, we're simplifying and improving our proprietary domain search experience. We see hundreds of millions of searches for domain names on GoDaddy every year, so we're in a unique position to use search patterns to reveal the most refined recommendations to our customers and help improve customer conversion. Third, we're integrating the primary and secondary markets to allow our users to identify the best domain amongst all available names, including entirely new domains alongside those already-registered domains that might be for sale. As Blake noted, we acquired over 200,000 domains in late April to increase the liquidity in the secondary market, and we've been really pleased with immediate interest in the names that we've acquired. Our second product group is Hosting and Presence, which grew 21.2% to $140 million in Q1. Hosting and Presence now makes up 37% of total revenue, up from 36% a year ago. We've been improving and expanding our offerings in Hosting over the past year, focusing on providing our customers with great performance, reliability and speed, while adding new options like our industry-leading Managed WordPress product and robust virtual private and dedicated server offerings. And just last week, we launched GoDaddy Pro into general availability, providing web designers and developers with a new suite of products and support that will help them save time as they build and manage websites for their clients. We worked with several thousand web pros in the beta of GoDaddy Pro, creating and refining tools that ease project management for these web professionals. Now we expect these various innovations to allow us to add more products and deepen our business relationships with our existing Pro customers and also to attract more end customers through this really important set of influencers. On the Presence side, we're continuing to see strong new sales and renewals of our DIY website builder product as well as terrific reception of new products like our Online Store builder and SEO product. In our third revenue line, Business Applications, we continued to see very strong growth, with revenue up 53% to $37 million for the quarter. Business Applications now makes up nearly 10% of our revenue versus just $7.5 million last year at this time. We're seeing strong adoption of the Microsoft Office 365 product suite we introduced in 2014 and solid renewals of our proprietary workspace email product as well. Our newest product, GoDaddy Email Marketing launched just last month, builds on our acquisition late last year of Mad Mimi and provides our customers with really simple, elegant and effective email marketing tools. The products in our Business Applications suite, in particular, demonstrate the power of our integrated platform to bring new products and service offerings to our customers over time. Now before we leave revenue, I'll touch briefly on our growth overseas. A key focus for us over the last couple years has been bringing all these products to customers in key international markets in localized form. We've made a huge push into Europe last year and began 2015 with offerings in 37 countries and 17 languages, with a primary focus on major English-speaking markets as well as Latin America and Europe. We gained share throughout 2014 across our major Tier 1 markets, including the U.K., India, Canada and Australia and expect to begin moving into Asia late this year in localized form. In the first quarter, our international revenue grew 23.4% to $96 million and now makes up over 1/4 of our total revenue. We feel good about how we're delivering on the top line. Turning to cost. Perhaps the most attractive attribute of our business is our customer unit economics. That's the profits that we generate over the lifetime of a customer relationship versus our cost to acquire that customer. In 2014, we acquired customers for roughly $50 to $60 each. Our average customer has generated more than $550 in gross profit during the course of their relationship with us. That's an LTV-to-CAC, or lifetime value versus our cost to acquire a customer, of approximately 10x and is personally my favorite metric for measuring the power of our business. We closely monitor and manage the metrics that contribute to this ratio. As we focus on moving overseas and target higher potential value segments like web professionals. Our costs to acquire customers may increase over time, but we expect to maintain attractive LTV-to-CAC ratios as the total spending and margin profiles of our customers increase as well. Looking briefly at our cost lines. Our gross margin increased by more than 280 basis points year-over-year to 63.5% in Q1. This is primarily because our 2 smaller higher-margin revenue lines, Hosting and Presence and Business Apps, are growing faster than our average. In Q1, our 2 go-to-market expense lines, marketing and advertising and customer care, grew the fastest year-over-year as we put more relative muscle behind the products and geographies that we've introduced over the past 15 to 18 months. By contrast, we got operating leverage from our 2 other major operating expense lines, G&A and technology and development. While the pace of growth slowed in technology and development in recent quarters, we still put nearly $68 million into that category in Q1, and over the past 5 years, we've invested nearly $1 billion in technology. Hopefully, you see and appreciate how we're balancing these various operating expenses to both serve our customers and help distance ourselves from other companies as well as, at the same time, allowing for modest margin expansion. And everyone can see how that played out in our Q1 results as our solid top line growth, combined with prudent investment, helped us grow adjusted EBITDA to $94 million in the quarter, up 17.8% year-over-year and producing margins of 25%. Now I'll note that Q1 typically represents our highest-margin quarter each year. We expect modest margin expansion for the full year overall, but we do expect our profit margins as a percent of revenue in the next several quarters to be lower than Q1. We also converted more than 90% of adjusted EBITDA into unlevered free cash flow in Q1. Unlevered free cash flow grew more than 70% year-over-year to $85 million. We expect our business will continue to generate substantial cash flow, but due to the timing of working capital needs and CapEx, our free cash flow generation may be lumpy quarter-to-quarter. Over time, we expect unlevered free cash flow to be roughly 70% to 90% of adjusted EBITDA. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the first quarter with net debt of $1.3 billion. Now as you all know, we completed our IPO immediately following quarter end, issuing 26 million shares at $20 per share and yielding $520 million in gross proceeds. In late April, we paid off a $300 million senior note and $75 million on our credit revolver. If the IPO and use of proceeds had occurred on March 31, our net debt would have been approximately $851 million and our pro forma leverage ratio would have been approximately 3x, which is a really comfortable level for the business over time. Looking forward, I'll provide some quick color on what we expect for Q2 and the full year financials. For the second quarter ending June 30, 2015, we expect revenue between $390 million and $395 million and adjusted EBITDA to fall into the range of $75 million to $78 million. For the full year ending December 31, we expect revenues to fall in the range of $1.595 billion to $1.605 billion and adjusted EBITDA to fall in the range of $322 million to $327 million. The midpoint of our outlook for the full year translates into year-over-year growth of 15.3% for revenue and 19.5% for adjusted EBITDA, implying an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 20.3%. We believe these targets allow for a healthy level of reinvestment in products, technology and care for our customers to deliver long-term value as well as delivering a solid incremental return for our shareholders in the near term. And as we said earlier, we feel great about the strong first quarter that we've delivered, and we look forward to continuing to do more for our customers in the months and years ahead. We believe that GoDaddy's unique combination of products, technology and care will continue to differentiate us in the market and to produce strong financial results going forward. With that, we'll open it up for questions. Marta Nichols : Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan with Deutsche Bank. Deepak Mathivanan : 2 questions for Scott and Blake. So first on the web pro strategy, you discussed in the past about the Managed WordPress product. How does this fit in the broader spectrum of web pro? And then how does this tie in with the GoDaddy Pro product? Would you consider both as different? Would you say the product offerings are expected to be integrated into one offering over time? And then secondly, the buildup of short-term deferreds seem to be a little bit higher than what we had expected. Was there any term difference in terms of contract, anything, which is specific to the first quarter? Or was there any difference in renewals? Blake Irving : Yes. Deepak, this is Blake. I'll answer your first question and hand it over to Scott for the second. The web pro strategy is a set of tools that allows a web pro to manage customers on the GoDaddy platform with a variety of different products. The different products range from a Managed WordPress product all the way to a fully dedicated server, whether being on a Linux platform or a Windows platform. The Managed WordPress product is one of the products in the developer or designer's portfolio that they can offer their customers and use the web pro tools that we've delivered to manage them on their customers' behalf, being able to actually buy things on the customers' behalf or be able to have the customer buy them themselves and allow the web pro to actually work on them as a delegate of their accounts. So it's a powerful set of tools, and we look at a web pro not just as a customer but also as a channel. And those new web pros will bring in new small business customers to us to allow us to service them as a customer with delegation capabilities so they can manage that small business customer's account. We know that 60% of small businesses today have somebody build their websites for them, and it's an incredible important channel for us and some really powerful tools to enable them to do their best work. Scott Wagner : Yes, this is Scott. Thanks, Deepak. I'll take the second question, and thanks for that. And it's a good notice. Term has or effective term has been shortening a bit, not only in the first quarter but really for the last several. And that's 2 things. One is product mix has a little bit to do it, but we've also been shortening our term lengths a bit, which has really been just selectively reducing long-term discounts for high-renewing products and again, managing the business over a lifetime value relationship. And so we don't really manage for term, but again, as you can see, the terms has been shortening a little bit, really, as we focus on long-term value in reducing some of those long-term marketing tactics. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC. Mark Mahaney : You talked about the cadence of international launches and the potential impact on CAC. Could you quantify how much of an impact you could see on CAC in international markets and just remind us again of how aggressively you want to continue to roll out in international markets over the next 12 to 18 months? Scott Wagner : Yes, thanks, Mark, it's Scott. So we're localized in Latin America and Europe right now. And as mentioned, we're going to go into Asia late this year and certainly, throughout 2016. And from a marketing standpoint, if you look at the marketing line specifically, you will see that on a year-over-year basis, we're spending a little bit more. And look, that reflects our continued buildup of markets geographically. And as mentioned, we're managing each of these markets on an LTV-to-CAC ratio and we get really attractive returns. And so we're going to continue to manage and feed out these markets based on that ratio and the success that we have. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray. C. Eugene Munster : Just a quick question. You guys had acquired some domain names in the quarter through Marchex. I was curious with just how those kind of play into your broader domain strategy. Blake Irving : Yes. Gene, this is Blake. So our overall strategy is to make sure that we have the best tools available to find the exact right match for a customer who's searching for a particular domain name. And that means strategically, not only providing names that are in the primary market of unclaimed domain names, but also in the secondary market of names that have already been claimed. And we thought that the Marchex portfolio actually had a lot of names that were frankly very desirable, and we've seen demand for them. And Scott mentioned earlier in the release, we actually get to see search terms that come through in our search dialog box in our metrics. So we have a pretty good sense for what people find interesting and we thought there was a great match from our customers on what they were looking for and what was in that domain portfolio. So strategically, it matched our desire for primary and secondary market mix and increasing our inventories so we can match exactly what a customer wants. C. Eugene Munster : You see -- you're doing that more in the future? Blake Irving : We -- one of our tenets strategically has been to combine those and make a very -- make it incredibly easy for finding a customer the perfect domain name for them. And if you're going to do a great job at that, you have to do a wonderful job mixing the primary and secondary markets, which is what we're doing and where we're making some significant investment. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer & Co. [Technical Difficulty] Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Sterling Auty : Yes, I'm definitely interested in asking a question. I want to start with -- actually, let me do one question, one follow-up and then I'll hand it off. Looking at the marketing spend in the quarter and the kind of returns that you're getting on it, what I'm kind of curious about is what should we think that level of spending is going to do for that customer acquisition growth. So the 13.1 million better than we expected. Given this level of spend, how should we think about that customer growth as we move into the coming quarters? Scott Wagner : Sterling, it's Scott. This is -- 13.1 million customers, right, it's a base that is hard to move in dramatic differences. And I think the pacing that you saw in the quarter follows a trajectory. And honestly, I wouldn't counsel you to think about the trajectory or pacing all that differently than what we did in the first quarter. Look, and I think at a higher level, I think the pacing of spend is really just part of our overall goal of delivering good top line and bottom line performance. We're managing the business so that in the next couple of quarters, you'll see us really probably feeding out these go-to-market expense lines a little more, whereas if we go back a couple of quarters, you'll notice a lot of our relative spend and investment was in technology and development. So what you're seeing now is really the go-to-market effort around those things. But the important thing is that they're working in harmony, and we're delivering good flow through to the bottom line. Sterling Auty : Okay. And then the follow-up would be, can you give us a sense of was there any change in kind of the tie ratio? Meaning what percentage of the customers or the business in the quarter was kind of domain-only versus what was the success rate in tying in the Hosting and Presence and Business Applications? Scott Wagner : I think you'll see no dramatic differences, Sterling. But if you look over the last 8 quarters, obviously, you're seeing ARPU and ARPU continue to grow and attachment grow. And this quarter, I think, in the results are just indicative of that strategy in action. Whereas we innovate in our product portfolio and we continue to get both elegant and sophisticated against the touch points, we're seeing attachment and adoption of these services go up, which is ultimately showing up in ARPU. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ronald Josey with JMP Securities. Ignatius Njoku : I'm Ignatius Njoku, I'm here for Ron. Just a quick question. In terms of products, can you talk about GoDaddy's mobile offering? The acquisition of M.dot clearly helps, but curious on your thoughts on app development. Blake Irving : Yes, so thanks, Ignatius. So our development on mobile has been primarily and will continue to be primarily a web-based mobile development platform. The thing that's very clear of what small businesses will tell you is that they want to develop a web presence, and they want to do it once. And they want that to be adaptable and readable and beautiful on mobile devices of varying screen sizes. What they don't want to do is actually have to go develop an application specifically for an iOS device or an Android device or a third possible device, whether it be a Windows phone or something else. They would like to make sure that their website, if they designed it specifically for a mobile device, shows up beautifully on a PC and vice versa. So the tools that we have been building are focused on making sure small businesses would show up wonderfully on handsets, on tablets and on PCs. As far as our e-commerce for our own business, you'll see us increasingly start focusing on making it incredibly simple for people to buy and manage their products from GoDaddy on mobile devices. I'll give you one example. We have a GoDaddy domain finder that is a native app, that has some hybrid web capability in it. And it is incredibly simple to find the perfect domain name for you, and honestly, I even consider it to be just a darn fun application to use when you're looking for a domain name. And it can use all the things that a phone has that are contextual, like location and movement, et cetera. So I think that's a good example of directionally of where we're going with our mobile devices across the entire product line, not just website-building, but hosting and our e-commerce work. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Brian Essex : I just wanted to pivot off of maybe Sterling's question a little bit and talk about the international expansion. And I guess the question is are you seeing a different profile of opportunity as you expand internationally and particularly with -- as it relates to ARPU? In other words, you have a more robust set of domain names with the ccTLDs to choose from that enables a little bit better uplift or margin. And then the second part of that question is are you able to penetrate that market with greater attach, whereas historically, you may have led with domains and hoped to land and expand through those customers? Are you able to kind of attach an initial sale at a better rate? Blake Irving : Brian, this is Blake. It's remarkable how similar the characteristics are and homogenous they are across the countries in which we've entered. We're finding that the dynamics of, \"I get a great name, I attach something to it and I'll get an email to run my back office,\" are almost identical to the United States. So the ARPU we're seeing across global markets today are very similar to what we've modeled in the U.S., and we have not seen any different or unusual purchase patterns where the entry point is considerably different than it has been in the U.S. And that said, we still, to this day, have not launched every single product we have in our portfolio internationally, so there is an opportunity for us to see a differing dynamic going forward over the course of the next quarters. But I think so far, we've seen almost identical behavior in international markets to the U.S. market. Scott Wagner : And I'll add one point, Brian, to your question. The CPAs, on a media basis, between the international and domestic, are very similar. So on -- and each markets have different profiles and we manage them on a localized basis, but U.S. versus non-U.S. markets of CPAs are pretty darn similar. Brian Essex : Got it. Real helpful. And I think a follow-up to it is do we see kind of -- you've anniversary-ed Media Temple. So a nice shot into you, I think you made a -- just a domain acquisition in this quarter. But 17% growth year-on-year, is that representative of what you might expect on an organic basis going forward? Or are there opportunities such as continued incremental up-sell of Hosting and Presence into the installed base? Or are you still kind of selling it on a standalone basis? Scott Wagner : Thanks, Brian, it's Scott. So if you look at, on a bookings basis, and I'll talk about revenue, Q4 and Q1, were organic. So on a trajectory basis, those 2 are pretty pure. And if you look at our '15 guidance, you can see approximately 15% revenue growth, which I think reflects on ongoing organic rate. Yes, just for the quarter, if you think about that '15 full year versus the first one, in Q1, there was approximately 150 basis points of purchase accounting that impacted us in Q1. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Vogel with Barclays. Mark Kelley : This is Mark Kelley in for Paul. I was wondering if you could share a bit more detail on bookings in the quarter, either split by domestic, international or by segment. Just broadly, did any region stand out more than others? Scott Wagner : Thanks, Mark. Not really. So I mean, I think bookings just reflects the same trajectory of both balance and growth internationally as well as the product lines. There isn't anything in the quarter relative to bookings that would give you any different feel for the business than the breakouts either by product or geography that we shared. I would say one thing that's helpful though. In bookings, obviously, we, like everybody else in the world, have been affected by the strong dollar. Our bookings line in Q1 had a shade over 200 basis points of currency headwind. And so again, if you're thinking about the pacing of bookings in Q4 to Q1 being pure organic numbers, obviously, FX hit us like just about every other USD business that operates globally in Q1. Again, our guidance incorporates where we stand at an FX basis going forward. Mark Kelley : Great. That's helpful. And I know international churn is a bit higher than it is in the U.S., with things like auto-renew not really a thing outside the U.S. What can you guys do from a customer retention standpoint internationally? Is it trying to get people to sign up for auto-renew? Or is there anything else that you guys can do on that front? Blake Irving : I can't be specific, Mark, but we had a number of things that we're working on that we think can help solve the auto-renew problem. And understand that auto-renew is flatout illegal in some places. So geographically, as you point out, there are some very specific issues with it. We have been -- we actually have some things that weigh heavily in our favor, like having a care organization that can call individuals and manage that. But even then, there are some laws against even contacting folks. Still, with that said, our retention globally is actually very, very good. So we see retention and renewal rates very similar to what we see in the U.S. and feel good about them, but we do believe that there are some things technically we can do that can help us do a better job, making sure folks are aware that their products are up for renewal, which is probably one of the biggest issues I think subscribers -- subscribing businesses have outside of the U.S. today. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer & Co. Jason Helfstein : Kind of 2 questions relating to marketing. So as we think about the rest of the year, and you think about marketing, do you -- how much of this will be around new gTLDs, newer products or kind of a combination of both? And then when you think about it, are we seeing more digital or less TV? Just how you're thinking about the mix. Scott Wagner : Yes, it's Scott. Thanks, Jason. Look, I think what you're seeing is a continued increase into our international markets. And now as we've added both products, whether it be Online O 365 or Email Marketing or new Online Store, we are both experimenting and feeding out more product-specific efforts on things that are non-domain related. And as we develop experiences for segments like the Pro, there's marketing dollars that are feeding behind those introductions. And again, like everything we do here, we test and learn, and the things that continue to work, we're going to feed them out. And look, I think it's important for everybody to realize that as we look at the full year, obviously, Blake mentioned that we're going to -- we're stopping our NASCAR sponsorship at the end of this year. That amount and that activity is still going on, and we're basically trialing, experimenting and feeding out some of these new growth areas while we're still carrying the full efforts and marketing spend of a NASCAR sponsorship through this year. Jason Helfstein : So with that, next year, we probably should see even more leverage as you redeploy those dollars? Scott Wagner : Again, we're managing this on the LTV-to-CAC ratio, so -- and know that when we find good spots to spend marketing dollars, we're going to spend it and then it will deliver great long-term value for the franchise. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions in queue. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters. Blake Irving : Hi, everyone. Hey, thanks. This is Blake. I just wanted a -- one last very quick call out. Thank you, all, for joining us today on our first quarterly earnings report, and we look forward to talking with you next quarter. So thanks a bunch for spending the time with us today. Operator : Thank you for joining. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the GoDaddy Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Marta Nichols, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Marta Nichols : Thanks, Connor. Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for GoDaddy's Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. With me today are Blake Irving, Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Wagner, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Blake and Scott have some prepared remarks, which we'll follow with a question-and-answer session. On today's call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, such as total bookings, adjusted EBITDA, unlevered free cash flow, net debt and ARPU. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents may be found in the presentation posted to our Investor Relations website at investors.godaddy.net or on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC with today's earnings release. The matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, August 5, 2015, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. With that, I'll turn the call over to Blake. Blake Irving : Thanks, Marta, and good afternoon, everyone. And thanks for joining us today. We delivered another strong quarter, with solid results from all of our major product lines, and we saw some really nice improvements in our customer experience. We remain laser-focused on our vision to radically shift the global economy towards small business by helping individuals easily start, confidently grow and successfully run their own ventures. We're a trusted partner and champion for organizations of all sizes in their quest to build a successful online presence. Our employees are inspired by our more than 13 million customers. We focus on giving them simple, powerful solutions that help them deliver online. We offer them a growing suite of elegant, easy-to-use and increasingly integrated cloud-based products built on a single global technology platform, supported by empathetic, consultative customer care, real people that are here to talk with and help our customers every single day. Our strategy and model have yielded a large, high-growth business with strong cash flow, serving a massive global market with growing needs. At the end of the second quarter, we've grown to serve over 13 million customers, an increase of more than 1 million customers versus a year ago. Our annual average revenue per user, or ARPU, rose nearly 9% to $118. Second quarter bookings grew 16% to $476 million, and together, our strong customer and ARPU growth drove our revenue up 17% to $395 million. Our adjusted EBITDA, which excludes IPO-related expenses, jumped 29% to $82 million in the second quarter, producing a solid adjusted EBITDA margin of nearly 21%. I'd like to share 3 big themes in our recent accomplishments in our second quarter results with everyone today. First, we're expanding our product portfolio and delivering innovative services; second, we're posting strong financial performance and growth; and third, we're seeing our platform and data science investments translate into increasingly personalized and integrated customer experiences. Let me spend a bit more time on each of those 3 briefly. On my first point about expanding our product portfolio, we demonstrated continued innovation in recent months in all 3 of our major revenue lines. In Domains, we now offer more than 375 top-level domain extensions, including gTLDs and ccTLDs, with 32 new gTLDs launched in the second quarter. And we passed 60 million domains under management for the first time this quarter. So we're continuing to grow our inventory and our Domains team delivered dramatic improvements in Domain's search speed and overall experience this quarter as well. In Hosting and Presence, we're continuing to expand our penetration of the hosting market, and our new GoDaddy Pro offering is ramping nicely, with tens of thousands of web professionals now signed up. Many thousands of our new GoDaddy Pro users are entirely new to GoDaddy and nearly half of them are coming from international markets, which we see as a great indication of the potential of this targeted product experience and of our international opportunity with professional developers and designers. In Business Applications, our recently launched GoDaddy Email Marketing product, or GEM, as we like to call it, is now available globally in multiple languages, and it's been embedded in both our Website Builder and GoDaddy Pro purchase experiences, allowing individuals to purchase GEM from inside other GoDaddy products. Our progress in all of these areas demonstrates our focus on delivering truly distinctive products on a single technology platform, all wrapped with world-class customer care. We see differentiated combination of products, technology and care as a unique advantage for us in serving our customers. On my second point about our financial performance, our Q2 results show that we're growing revenue across all 3 of our business lines while continuing to invest in innovation and growth, all while delivering strong cash flow and margins. Scott's going to spend more time on this in a minute. And third, on our focus on creating wonderful customer experiences, we're seeing positive early results from our investments in our platform and data science. We believe our focus on the underlying platform that powers our products in customer relationships is very unique in our industry, and it will allow us to deliver a more seamless customer experience over time. We see huge opportunity to delight our customers through personalized and integrated experiences : tailoring our messages to them, making our products easier to find and use together and giving our customers myriad ways to get help, whenever and wherever they need. Let me give you just a few examples of how personalization shows up for us and our customers. First, on our homepage and our outbound marketing, we're beginning to use our data science to personalize our homepages and marketing globally. To date, we now have tens of thousands of unique homepages running across the world, and our data science marketing homepage and product teams continue to refine the volume and content of our messaging to customers, whether by phone, chat or email. Second, on products, we're integrating our various product applications to create new ways for customers to discover, use and purchase new products. Take GoDaddy Email Marketing, or GEM, and our Office 365 products. We're now embedding these applications in our other products, making it easier for our Website Builder customers to buy Office 365 or discover and use GEM email marketing to connect with their own customers when they're ready for it, and that's important. And third, on customer care, we're rolling out innovative tools such as a world-class CRM system and an all-new, mobile-first online help capability to help our care consultants provide our customers with a great experience. And honestly, we're just getting started across all aspects of personalization. We believe our intense focus on our customers and their needs for easy-to-use products delivered on a single global technology platform, delivered with exceptional customer care. That rare combination of products, technology and care will continue to differentiate GoDaddy and produce strong financial results going forward. Now let me turn the call over to Scott to talk about the financial results in more detail. Scott? Scott Wagner : Thanks, Blake, and thanks from me for joining us as well. As Blake said, we feel great about what we delivered in the second quarter. We grew customers 9% over the last year, ending Q2 with approximately 13.3 million paying customers. Our annual average revenue per user, or ARPU, grew nearly 9% year-over-year to $118, up from $108 a year ago. As Blake said, our second quarter bookings grew 16% and solid growth in both customers and ARPU drove revenue up 17%, with each of our 3 product lines, Domains, Hosting and Presence and Business Applications, growing at double-digit rates. As a reminder to everyone, we report and measure our top line in 2 ways : bookings and revenue. Our bookings represent the cash we collect when a customer purchases a product. We typically collect the full purchase price at the time of sale, then recognize our GAAP revenue ratably over the term of the customer contract, which averages more than 1 year. Over the past 5 years, on average, we've generated 90% of our revenue each year from customers already in our base at the start of the year. While we experience annual customer churn of less than 15%, the 85% of customers who do stay with us typically spend more, which translates into limited revenue churn. In short, we have a very stable revenue model. Now I'll briefly run through the results in each of our 3 revenue lines. First, on Domains, we continue to extend our market leadership, with Domains revenue up 10.3% in the second quarter to $209 million. The domain market continues to grow on a secular basis as more businesses and individuals claim and name their ideas online, and we're working hard to continue to outgrow the market. While Domains revenue continues to expand for us, it now contributes about 53% of our total revenue, down from 56% a year ago, as our 2 other revenue lines grow faster. Our objective in Domains is pretty simple. It's to enable our customers to easily find the perfect name wherever they are in the world and to turn that perfect name into a great online presence. And there are several ways we're doing that. First, we continue to expand our domains inventory with 32 new gTLDs launched in Q2. At the end of the quarter, we offered more than 375 gTLDs and ccTLDs and had over 850,000 new gTLD domains under management. Second, Blake mentioned the huge improvements in domain search speed. We view speed and comprehensiveness of results as key features in domain search. These are real differentiators that set the domain experience at GoDaddy distinctly apart from other registrars. We'd encourage everyone to try our domain experience and assess the speed, merchandising flow and activation ease relative to other options in the market. We think you're going to like what you'll find, not just in the U.S., but increasingly around the world. In this quarter, we began testing and deploying machine learning to algorithmically tune domain search results by location in several Tier 1 markets around the world, and there's much more to come. Our second product group is Hosting and Presence, which grew 18.5% in Q2 to $145 million. Hosting and Presence now makes up roughly 37% of our total revenue. We've been expanding our offerings in hosting, focusing on providing our customers with great performance, reliability and speed, while adding new options like our industry-leading Managed WordPress product and robust virtual private and dedicated server offerings. We launched GoDaddy Pro in May, and it's been well received in the design and development community. Blake noted we have tens of thousands of pros participating, and about half of them are from overseas. Now GoDaddy Pro is still in its infancy. But so far, our initial customers love the ability to easily manage clients and products through GoDaddy using features like delegation, shared shopping and site performance. We expect these innovations to allow us to add more products and deepen our business relationships with our existing Pro customers and also to attract more end customers through this important set of influencers over time. On the Presence side, we continue to see strong new sales and renewals of our DIY Website Builder product and our Online Store builder. In our third revenue line, Business Applications, we continued to see very strong growth, with revenue up 51.4% in Q2 to $41 million. Business Applications now makes up about 10% of total revenue. We continue to see strong adoption of the Microsoft Office 365 product suite that we introduced in 2014 and solid renewals of our proprietary workspace email product as well. We've integrated GoDaddy Email Marketing, or GEM, into our Website Builder product and also enabled GEM for our web pro program. So now pros can purchase GEM for their clients using shared shopping and help their clients do email marketing effectively. Also on the topic of integrating our different products, we've embedded Office 365 into the Website Builder purchase experience, resulting in both a better experience for our customers and increased attachment of Office 365 units. The products in our Business Applications group in these initial product integrations, in particular, demonstrate the power of our platform to bring new products and service offerings to market and to connect our individual products together to create a seamless and distinctive experience for our customers. Before we leave revenue, I'll discuss growth overseas quickly. And our key focus for GoDaddy over the last couple of years has been to localize our site and products across various geographic markets. We made a huge push into Europe last year and began 2015 with offerings in 37 countries and 17 languages, with a primary focus on major English-speaking markets as well as Latin America and Europe. We've been steadily gaining share of total domains registered across our major Tier 1 markets, including the U.K., India, Canada and Australia, and are now laying the foundations for bringing our next major markets in Asia online. Q2 was our first quarter with international revenue above $100 million. International grew 19.6% versus the prior year and now represents over 25% of our total revenue. Blake and I want to give kudos, both to our core international team and to all of the teams across GoDaddy, from Domains, to Hosting, to Business Apps, marketing care and so on, who've joined forces to establish and grow our international business to over $100 million in quarterly revenue. We look forward to international becoming an even larger percentage of our revenue mix over time. Turning now to cost. Perhaps the most attractive attributes of our business is our customer unit economics. That is the profits that we generate over the lifetime of a customer relationship versus our cost to acquire that customer. Over the last several years, we've acquired customers for roughly $50 to $60 each. Our average customer has generated more than $550 in gross profit during the course of their relationship with us. That's an LTV-to-CAC, or lifetime value versus our cost to acquire a customer, of approximately 10x, an attractive ratio. We closely monitor the metrics that contribute to this ratio. Now as we focus on moving overseas and targeting higher potential value segments like Web Pros, we expect our cost to acquire customers will increase over time, but we also expect to maintain attractive LTV-to-CAC ratios as we look for the spending and margin profiles of our customers to increase as well. Looking briefly at our cost lines. Our gross margin increased by more than 210 basis points year-over-year to 64.6% in Q2. This is primarily because our 2 smaller, higher-margin revenue lines, Hosting and Presence and Business Apps, are growing faster than our average. Turning to our operating costs. As expected and disclosed in our prospectus in our 10-Q filed in May, our second quarter G&A included nearly $30 million in IPO-related expenses, stemming from agreements that terminated with the completion of the IPO. Excluding these IPO-related costs, G&A would've been roughly up 7% on a year-over-year basis. In Q2, our 2 go-to-market expense lines, marketing and advertising and customer care, grew faster year-over-year as we put more relative muscle behind the products and international markets that we've introduced over the past 18 months. Again, excluding the costs related to the IPO, we're seeing operating leverage from our 2 other major operating expense lines : G&A and technology and development. While the pace of aggregate tech and dev expense growth has slowed in recent quarters, we're still investing meaningfully in our customer-facing platform and product applications, both to delight our customers and to create competitive differentiation for us. Hopefully, everyone on the call appreciates how we're achieving steady margin expansion while continuing to invest in our capabilities and growth opportunities for the future. Our results show that balance playing out in Q2, as our solid top line growth combined with prudent investment helped us grow adjusted EBITDA to $82 million, up 29% year-over-year, yielding a margin of 20.9% in the quarter, which was up 200 basis points versus prior year. In the second quarter, we also converted more than 90% of our adjusted EBITDA into unlevered free cash flow. Year-over-year, unlevered free cash flow grew over 21% to $77 million. Just a quick note to everyone about below-the-line items in the quarter. Please note that our reported net loss included over $51 million in expenses related to the completion of the IPO in the second quarter. This includes the approximately $30 million in G&A, IPO-related expenses, which I mentioned a moment ago; and roughly $21 million in debt extinguishment costs associated with the repayment of our $300 million senior note using the IPO proceeds. We expect our business will continue to generate substantial free cash flow due to the timing of working capital needs and CapEx, our free cash flow generation may be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter. But over time, we expect unlevered free cash flow to be roughly 70% to 90% of adjusted EBITDA. On the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with net debt of approximately $794 million. With the repayment of the $300 million senior note, we expect to save over $25 million in annual interest expense.  Our second quarter net leverage ratio of just over 2.5x is a very comfortable level for the business. Looking forward, I'll provide some color on what we expect for Q3 and full year financials. For the third quarter ending September 30, 2015, we expect revenue between $405 million and $410 million and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $82 million to $85 million. For the full year ending December 31, 2015, we expect revenues in the range of $1.595 billion to $1.605 billion, and we're raising our outlook for adjusted EBITDA to a range of $328 million to $333 million. In the second half of the year, we're going to continue our investment spend to both build out new product categories, lay the foundation for future geographic expansion, continue our marketing spend and expand our use of data science to increasingly personalize our customer interactions. The midpoint of our full year 2015 outlook translates into year-over-year growth of 15.3% for revenue and 22% for adjusted EBITDA, implying an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 20.7%. We believe these targets continue to allow for a healthy level of reinvestment in products, technology and care for our customers to drive long-term value as well as delivering a solid incremental return for our shareholders in the near term. So to wrap up, we feel great about our performance in Q2, and we're focused on delivering for our customers and our shareholders over time. We believe that GoDaddy's unique combination of products, technology and care will continue to differentiate us in the market and to produce strong future financial results. With that, we will open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Mark Mahaney : I had 2 housekeeping questions, and then, a broader one. If you could just talk through the FX impact on your overall bookings growth rate, and then, the -- what the organic growth rate of the Business Apps segment would have been. Those are the 2 housekeeping questions. And then, on the customer service side, I know how much of a priority it is for the company, are there any metrics you could call out in terms of improvements you've made there with -- on the customer service function? Anything you could call out there? Scott Wagner : Yes, great. Mark, it's Scott. Thanks. So 2 housekeeping items. First, FX. Last quarter, we described to everybody that our bookings had about 200 basis points of FX impact. And then, the currency markets really haven't changed all that much, and that's about the year-over-year impact that we saw in the second quarter as well. Now our bookings overall of 16% had that headwind in it, so we feel really good about how bookings fell in the quarter, particularly relative to, still, where currencies sit. So that's one. And second, in terms of Business Apps, it's all organic. So the 51% is just continued trajectory in the business, and it's all organic. In terms of C3 and our care improvements, we are investing in a couple of things now, which we're particularly excited about. One of which is a best-in-class CRM system that's going to provide our agents with a true realtime view of what's happening with our customers across all aspects of their environment, and even things that they do online that may be outside of GoDaddy. This is in pilot mode right now, and we're excited about  what it means for our customers, and that will continue to roll out in the coming quarters. And all of our time tool set has really improved both call response times, satisfaction and other quality-of-service metrics that have been great. And from a business side, I think we've mentioned before that care is also a channel that delivers bookings as well, and the team continues to perform really well on those numbers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan with Deutsche Bank. Deepak Mathivanan : Great. First question, maybe for Blake. So you mentioned that you have tens of thousands of developers for the Pro product. Can you discuss the level of engagement on the product among these pros? What features are the most commonly used inside the product? And then, maybe how many end-customer accounts have they onboarded? Do you also see like incremental customers coming in, maybe to your Hosting products, at this time? I know it's still like early stages, but perhaps, some early feedback on it. And then, I have a follow-up. Blake Irving : Sure. Thanks, Deepak. Okay. Yes, this is Blake. So what we've seen in -- the new GoDaddy Pro features enable a developer or a designer to have a relationship with their customer and actually see it the way that their customers' sites are performing. So they can buy on a customer's behalf, they can manage the customer's cart, they can see how their website is performing, and instead of being called by a customer and told that, \"Hey, my website's down,\" they actually can make the phone call to a customer and say, \"I've noticed you have a problem, I'd like to go solve it for you.\" Or if you're -- you have a WordPress plug-in that's not performing for some reason, they can follow on that with the customer. That -- we have 2 features. One's called delegation, the other is monitoring. Those are the 2 features that are the ones that are strongly differentiated in the marketplace and are having a lot of pull with these guys. We have, of those tens of thousands, we've seen thousands of folks that are new customers for us, and we're starting to see an increasing number of customers of theirs show up on the platform. So we're pleased with results. It's not a service that we pay for, it's a service -- or the developers pay for, it's a service that provides them value in some of the top critical issues they have that we're solving on their behalf. Deepak Mathivanan : Okay, that makes sense. And then, ARPU continues to grow on a good trajectory, up 9%, and it's definitely due to a mixed shift towards higher ARPU products. Can you qualitatively maybe discuss what up-sell rates you're seeing in the last, say, couple of quarters? What products are seeing good adoption there? And maybe specifically on the site builder, the DIY site builder, can you discuss the growth rates there? Scott Wagner : Yes. Hey, it's Scott, Deepak. Yes, I mean, ARPU was up 8.6% this quarter. It was a shade over 9% last quarter. It's nice trajectory. And really, you're looking at just continued growth in Hosting and Presence and Business Apps. I mean, it would be -- it'd almost be misleading to point out any one particular product. It's really the growth across both of these -- those 2 segments and, obviously, the subsegments underneath them, whether it be Managed WordPress or Office 365 or some of the more sophisticated hosting offerings. I could rattle off, sort of -- I did 3, I could rattle off 7 more, and all of which contribute. And I think the headline for everybody on the call would be, the ARPU gains are really just a reflection of the product innovation and the product strategy that's been underway for probably the last couple of years. Deepak Mathivanan : Okay, that's helpful. Scott, if I can squeeze in one more, just housekeeping. What was kind of like the revenue contribution from the Marchex domains acquired? And how do you treat it in the domains under management? Scott Wagner : Yes, so it was immaterial in the quarter. So we closed that in the second quarter, it was immaterial for the quarter. What we did see, though, and the reason that we even did and -- did the Marchex deal was that we're big believers, over the long term, of the ability and potential in the aftermarket, which is to merchandise names in a liquid fashion for -- that are already held, and obviously, this was a portfolio of names that were really unavailable on the market. And when we merchandised these names, we saw nice activity across our entire aftermarket business for the quarter. This was just one element that had domains revenue growing 10% year-over-year, which was basically about what we did in the first quarter, too. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Jason Helfstein : Three questions. First, results would suggest a greater mix to annual subscription. So just talk about any dynamics there and kind of what impact that might be having as potentially an offset to ARPU. Second, are you guys seeing any impact as far as on the stronger dollar, i.e., customers choosing lower -- international customers choosing lower-priced plans? And does that have any impact on the back half guidance? And then, lastly, should we expect you to be more aggressive in product acquisitions? It just seems like there are some interesting things out there that would be -- you could really utilize, given your customer mix and kind of just all the customer support you're offering to up some more products. Scott Wagner : I'll try it. Yes, Jason, it's Scott. I'll do the first 2 and let Blake talk about the second one. In terms of bookings to revenue, it's -- there's not a meaningful difference in the shift of plan mix. Given that we've got a portfolio of products and some of them just have different characteristics or mechanisms on recognition, and obviously, sometimes, we're selling different term lengths, there's not one thing happening. And actually, we think that the annual -- the bookings-to-revenue relationship and our mix of annual plans is just a really healthy one. And there's nothing specific to call out that would suggest things are lengthening or the terms are dramatically changing. So that's one. Second, on the strong dollar, just like with Mark's question, the strong dollar, obviously, it's still out there on a year-over-year basis. It's approximately 200 basis points of headwind, but yes, I think, we're managing through it. And the trade-off, we are balancing the trade-off of customer acquisition, which continues to be healthy in our international markets and, still, the currency effect, and we think we're doing a pretty good job and are pretty happy about it. And our guidance reflects a currency environment that stays where it is. So we don't think that there's any special things in the second half that we'd call out because of this. We think we're basically managing through it right now. Blake? Blake Irving : Jason, this is Blake. So on your M&A question, so we continually make -- well, I'll just call it, make buy partner decisions on areas that we think our customers are demanding or we believe will benefit them. And those exist in, whether it's Domains, whether it's in the Presence and Hosting business or whether it's in the Business Applications business, customers are pretty clear with us what's important to them, and we keep an eye on the market carefully. We talk to a lot of companies, as I know you know. We've acquired -- been pretty acquisitive and have acquired 9 companies over the last 24 months or so. So we are looking in areas that we think, frankly, matter to our customers in both Presence and Hosting business, the Business Apps business, and as well as international, too. So I think, without getting any more specific than that, I think that kind of covers where we're -- what we're thinking. Scott Wagner : Yes, I mean, our organic trajectories did really good. I think, Jason, you framed it as, boy, there's opportunities, they're out there, it's just we've got a high bar for success. We'll do -- when we do stuff, it's going to be because it's adding real value and distinctiveness for our customer experience, but we've got a pretty high bar on the inorganic stuff. Blake Irving : Yes, big time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. Mark May : I had 2. First, I was hoping you could remind us about how the gross margins roughly differ between the 3 segments, in particular, with Domains, just so we can get to -- continue to think about the upside to gross margins going forward from the revenue mix shift. And then, on Business Apps, can you remind us -- I know that Office 365 has been a real good product for you guys. Are we going to hit a point where you kind of comp that and the growth rates that we see there will kind of differ? Remind us where we are and how to think about that going forward. And I know you have a relatively new email marketing product there. Is that something that, you think, will help to offset some of that comping issue if, in fact, that's something to be thinking about? Blake Irving : Mark. This is Blake. Scott and I are going to riff back and forth on this one. So margins on the 3 product segment. The first, which is Domains, we're  roughly in the high 30s. And both in Hosting and Presence and Business Applications, they're what you'd expect from a software business, so they're typical software margins, whether it's on GEM or whether it's on O-365. Scott Wagner : Yes. And your second question on growth rate and trajectory on Apps, it -- we will -- absolutely, that growth rate will end up tapering and slowing. And it's -- it gave up a couple points versus the first quarter, from 53% to 51%. We've already lapped the Office 365 introduction, and there's nothing in the next quarter or 2 that's going to cause a dramatic cliff in the growth rate. But you should expect that area and product segment to continue to slow. We think GEM, and then, plus other category extensions and things that we can do, we'll try to keep that growth growing and push it up, so. Blake Irving : Yes, and just building on Scott's comment, renewal on O 365, very strong. And when -- we've integrated that -- you heard Scott and I both talk about integration of Office 365 and GEM into the Website Builder product, and frankly, we're seeing greater activation and usage. So even while the -- we've lapped those -- we've lapped that introduction. We're seeing, what I'd really call, still really good growth in that segment, and I anticipate it to continue to be good. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Ronald Josey : I wanted to ask about cost in tech dev spending, specifically. Scott, I think you mentioned, we can see in the numbers, tech dev growth has been -- the spending has been decelerating for the past several quarters. I think it grew like 4% this year. I understand the balancing of the business, but you're also investing quite a bit in launching new products. So I'm just wondering, is this slowdown in spend more of a pause as you operationalize all the new products? Or are you just well-staffed in this segment right now and sort of -- and this is the right run rate? Blake Irving : Ron, this is Blake. Look, we I think you accurately point out that we've spent -- we had an increase in spend in -- like earlier in T&D, but -- and we're up some 7% year-over-year. I'll say this, the investments that we made years ago, and you always -- when you're making technology investments, you always have sort of a trailing result of those. So what we're seeing now is the investments that we made over the last 24 months are actually starting to benefit the business. And you heard Scott and I both talk about the -- both of us talk about the uplift in platform capability across everything that we've been rolling out, whether it's front of site, whether it's our customer care organization, the integration from other products across the board. So we continue to invest in engineering talent, particularly in both product applications and product teams. We're getting, frankly, good savings in our global infrastructure, and we've actually had, I guess, I'd characterize it, as a shift from spending a lot on IT infrastructure to being able to spend on talent. So you're seeing the numbers not increase, but the balance of how we're spending that T&D spend is quite different, and it's on talent. And we have, frankly, been extremely successful in acquiring talent in our locations in Sunnyvale, San Francisco, Seattle, Cambridge Massachusetts, and we're feeling good about the investments we made and what they're going to yield in the future. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Brian Essex : Blake, I just had a question for you, particularly on GoDaddy Pro. You noted how many international customers are coming onboard with that effort. Are you seeing any kind of maybe an outside opportunity internationally or difference in mix of the tax rates of customers that you're onboarding for -- from international markets relative to those in the U.S.? Blake Irving : I'd say no. And I think, the thing to point out that's most important is GoDaddy Pro is very new, right? So we're seeing very good success with it initially. But 50% of small businesses today rely on a professional developer to build a website for them, to develop a web presence for them, and I think that we -- this is not an area that we've been strong in over the last many years. And the products have improved, the quality, the performance across dedicated, managed -- our Managed WordPress products, I think we've seen a considerable improvement there, and it's being noted by developers, so we're starting to see them come on. Now the fact that we've actually localized products in GoDaddy Pro for other markets is something that's unique and new. So I think that, that also has some large pull-through for us. Brian Essex : Got it. And then, maybe a follow-on to Ron's question. A question for Scott. As we look at CAC and your investment in growing the business, both domestically and internationally, I understand that there's rev rec differential there from when you are able to sign a customer on and when you can recognize revenue. Should we expect any fluctuations in CAC, particularly on a per-customer basis as you expand and maybe keep in mind how that revenue is going to be recognized in the future? Scott Wagner : Yes, Brian. I think, CAC, probably not dramatic fluctuations in rev rec, as you posited it. So you're  not going to see huge swings on a quarter-over-quarter basis. As I said earlier, we should expect CAC spend to go up on average, particularly as we get smarter about targeting high-value segments like Pros or other attributes of small businesses that have higher propensity to spend. And so what you're seeing on our marketing is more dollars aiming at those higher-value subsegments, and over time, that could push CAC up. But it's not going to be dramatic swings. That'll be an evolution and a flow, and that'll happen on a measured basis. And the most important point being that, that's not happening in isolation. It's that we're actually going -- not only finding customers, but we're attaching more things to customers, and the spending profile and the margin profile are going up as well. So we're doing all this while still maintaining an attractive ratio. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Sterling Auty : Yes, I wanted to give you guys just -- I have a chance to ask this question on the call. The most popular question I got from investors after the print is, you've had 2 straight quarters of very solid bookings, 16% growth in the quarter. Why didn't that give you enough ammunition to actually maybe inch up guidance for the full year? Scott Wagner : Sterling, we feel good about where the guidance is and looking forward in the second half, and it's something -- even with FX headwind, as I've said before, that we're incorporating that into our guidance, and we just think that it's prudent with our guidance to have worries right now. Again, I would mention, obviously, we're lifting our EBITDA guidance, and the performance has been really solid there, and we feel very comfortable with the meaningful step-up in EBITDA guidance that we just put forward. Sterling Auty : Okay, great. And then, on the international front, can you give us a sense, in the markets that are contributing most to growth, is there any difference in your approach in terms of what you're selling off the bat in terms of the Domain plus any tie to Hosting and Applications? I mean, is there a difference versus what you're doing here in the U.S.? Scott Wagner : Not meaningful, Sterling, both relative to the U.S. and across the markets. There's distinction without a difference as you get into certain markets, but it's relatively similar. Sterling Auty : But that means that the new users right from the get-go in these international markets probably come on with a higher dollar value initially than, say, what the U.S. did 3 and 4 years ago before you guys came on board, correct? Scott Wagner : More way back when. If you look at international, I think we've said this before, there is a lifetime value difference in international. It's probably 10% to 15% less than the U.S., and that's ARPU-driven. And some of that is price sensitivity in more developed markets, and then, some of it is just a less fulsome attachment of some of the other services and just the relative use of the customer base. So punchline is, international ARPU is less than that in the states, but it's not a meaningful difference, it's 10% to 15%. Blake Irving : And this is Blake, Sterling. One other thing I'd point out that is different, if you think about GoDaddy years and years ago, the product portfolio is much more full today than it was a long while ago, and the quality and performance of those products have changed pretty dramatically over the last 2.5, 3 years. So that notably has a competitive product set that's easy to acquire. That on-ramp of domains matters a lot, and we've just made it incredibly simple for somebody to take that next step, either say I'm going to go build a website for myself or I'm going to have a professional developer do it for me. And we've made the services for that professional developer matter a lot more, too. So it's just a different evolution in the company, and so we've made it easier to acquire products. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Mark Kelley with Barclays. Mark Kelley : I'm just curious how you're approaching marketing outside the U.S. I know the Super Bowl has been a huge benefit to your domestic brand awareness, and I would imagine that it's pretty hard to replicate that reach. So it seems like there's a lot of moving pieces with the NASCAR partnership pending, so any thoughts you have there would be helpful. Scott Wagner : It's Scott, Mark. Look, if we think about a geography in our Tier 1 markets, we will enter that geography with a mix that has both brand awareness and direct spend, but it's single-digit millions of dollars, and that's a entry into a market. And so take India or the U.K. or Canada, we're on the back end of that investment. And what we've seen is that, again, a relatively modest amount of marketing spend, measured in the single millions of dollars, has created an activation in customer growth that's been a terrific return. So I think what that means, relative to how you framed your question was, we don't necessarily need to go replicate the NASCAR sponsorship or a Super Bowl venue to enter a market in localized form and get a big uptick, not only in awareness and attention in the market, but more importantly, our customer and financial metrics. Blake Irving : Just -- this is Blake. Just a quick example. In India, Mark, over the course of the last of 3 years, we've moved from the teens in terms of -- low teens in terms of brand awareness to over 70% brand awareness today. And that's, as Scott said, using a variety of different media : broadcast media, programmatic display and search. And doing those things in combination, we have found that there is a pretty intense amount of bleed-over from the U.S., in our marketing spend in the U.S. to other markets outside of the U.S. So when we activate the brand in a Tier 1 market like India, we see results happening more quickly than you would expect to see them if we were making those investments initially in the U.S. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters. Blake Irving : Great. Well, okay, this is Blake. I just wanted to thank all of you for joining us on our second quarter earnings report out, and I look forward to talking to you a quarter from now in our next release. Thanks, everyone. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Dan and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the GoDaddy Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to VP of Investor Relations, Marta Nichols. Please go ahead. Marta Nichols : Thanks, Dan. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for GoDaddy\u2019s third quarter 2015 earnings call. With me today are Blake Irving, Chief Executive Officer and Scott Wagner, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Blake and Scott have some prepared remarks, which will follow with a Q&A session. On today\u2019s call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, such as total bookings, adjusted EBITDA, un-levered free cash flow, net debt and ARPU. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents maybe found in the presentation posted our IR site at investors.godaddy.net or on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC with today\u2019s earnings release. The matters we will be discussing include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, November 4, 2015 and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. With that, I will turn the call over to Blake. Blake Irving : Hey, everyone. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us today. We are pleased to report we put up our third quarter of solid results as a public company with strong contributions from all of our major product lines. As we deliver for our customers and our shareholders each quarter, our vision remains unchanged, radically shift the global economy towards small business by helping individuals easily start, confidently grow and successfully run their own ventures. Organizations of all sizes trust GoDaddy in their quest to build the successful online presence. And our recent survey of global small businesses shows that our global opportunity is still significant. We found that 59% of small businesses still don\u2019t have a web presence. We offer millions of global customers a growing suite of elegant, easy-to-use and increasingly integrated cloud-based products built on a single global technology platform and supported by outcome driven personalized customer care. These are real people that are here to talk with and help our customers every single day. Our strategy and model have yielded a large high growth business with strong cash flow serving a massive global market with growing needs. At the end of Q3, we have grown to serve nearly 13.6 million customers, an increase of more than 1 million customers versus a year ago. Our annual average revenue per user, or ARPU rose almost 7% to $119. Q3 bookings grew 14% to $476 million and our strong customer and ARPU growth together drove our revenue up 15% to $411 million. Our adjusted EBITDA jumped 22% to almost $88 million in Q3, producing a solid margin of over 21% and we converted 90%, over 90% of adjusted EBITDA into unlevered free cash flow. I would like to share three big themes and our recent progress and accomplishments in Q3 results with everyone today. First, we are continuing to expand our product portfolio and deliver innovative services. Second, we are consistently posting strong financial performance and growth. And third, our efforts to evolve and grow our brands are changing the way people think about GoDaddy. Let me spend a bit of time on each of those briefly. On my first point about expanding our product portfolio, we have been innovating in all three of our major revenue lines. In domains, we continue to grow faster than the industry due to our expanding demand inventory, our industry leading proprietary domain search and our efforts to expand the domain aftermarket. We have recently passed more than 61 million domains under management and that\u2019s over 20% of the world\u2019s total domains that we managed. In Hosting and Presence, we are expanding our penetration of the hosting market with a unique understanding of the needs of small businesses offering both hosting products and tools targeted at the professional, like our industry leading Managed WordPress offering and simple tools that allow a business owner to build the site on their own like our website builder and online store builder tools. We also introduced a new Search Engine Visibility technology that allows any website using GoDaddy DNS to place higher search results without requiring the customer to manually update their websites\u2019 code. The service has been previously offered on a Website Builder and Managed WordPress products, but now it\u2019s available for any website regardless of who host it. Our innovative SEV technology has delivered a product that\u2019s simple for small businesses to use, and most importantly, it really works and it is super effective. In Business Applications, we have seamlessly integrated GoDaddy Email Marketing, or GEM as we like to call it, a Shippo shipping solutions and McAfee Security Solutions into our online store offering. This is enabling customers to purchase and activate these products inside the site builder experience. And this is important, so I don\u2019t want you to miss this. We are making it possible for customers to discover and use other GoDaddy products like e-mail that meet an immediate need, while they are using other GoDaddy products, not through a separate marketing message. This is something we call in-app discovery and purchase capabilities, a big benefit to our customers. It allows them to find, try and use the right next product super easily and makes our full portfolio of products more valuable together than apart. For GoDaddy, for us, this is one of several growth levers that can help drive ARPU. Also in business apps, we are seeing strong renewals of our proprietary workspace email product as well as continued growth of Office 365. And our O365 offer just keeps getting better. We brought our O365 provisioning to a median of 90 seconds for a customer\u2019s first mailbox purchase and that\u2019s an awesome user experience. It\u2019s improving both activation and usage. Our progress in all these area demonstrates our focus on delivering truly distinctive products on a single technology platform, all wrapped with world-class customer care. And we see our differentiated combination of products, technology and care as a unique advantage for us in serving our customers. On my second point about our financial performance, we have delivered consistently strong financial results prior to and since our IPO growing revenue across all three of our business lines, while continuing to invest in innovation and growth, all while delivering increasing cash flow and margins. Scott is going to spend more time on this in a minute. And third, the investments we are making globally in the GoDaddy brand are showing promising results. And there is much more plan. Let me say a little bit about that. Along with all the product, tech and scale work that Scott and I have talked with all of you about, we have also have been taking very deliberate steps to align our brand with our global customer value proposition, our culture and our technology investments around the world. And we are doing that in several ways. First, our global advertising is increasingly aligned with our products, our technology and our customers increasing awareness. For instance, in India over the last three years, we have seen our aided brand awareness more than double to almost 80%. Second, we have been focusing on our employment brand with an emphasis on technology, transparency and diversity. For example, we recently published our gender diversity and salary parity research highlighting the challenges we and all tech companies face in building a gender-balanced workforce, from salary parity to promotion trajectory. We have also invested in a relationship with the MIT Media Lab to further the science behind bringing customers to small businesses through their community. And third, and yesterday, we announced we have engaged GoDaddy\u2019s first global brand agency, TBWA, to help us further refine our story and bring a unified message to our increasingly global audience. Small business customers need a dedicated partner to help them start, run and grow their business online around the world and that is GoDaddy. With the help of the clear message about who we are, what we do, and who we do it for, we believe our intense focus on our customers and their needs will continue to differentiate GoDaddy and produce strong financial results. Now, I am going to turn this call over to Scott to talk about the financial results in more detail. Scott? Scott Wagner : Thanks, Blake and thanks from me for joining us as well. As Blake said, we feel great about what we delivered in the third quarter. Overall, I would like to highlight three key financial points. First, we continue to deliver strong, consistent revenue growth with a nice balance between customer and ARPU increases. Second, we are consistently delivering even faster growth in free cash flow, with over 22% growth in adjusted EBITDA and an increase of more than 40% in unlevered free cash flow in Q3. Those are great gains in our two key profitability measures. Third, we are well positioned to deliver the solid combination of top and bottom line growth into 2016 and beyond. Touching on each of these three things in more detail and starting with the top line, we grew bookings 14% and revenue 15% in Q3. In terms of the drivers of revenue, customers grew 9% over last year and we ended Q3 with approximately 13.6 million paying customers. Our annual average revenue per user or ARPU grew nearly 7% to $119, up from $112 a year ago. Our product lines all grew at double-digit rates in the quarter. Touching on our product lines briefly, domains revenue finished the quarter at $215 million, up 10% year-over-year. Our domain business continues to be fueled by; one, international growth; two, share gain in the markets in which we compete; three, successful attachment of renewals of domains, driven by our proprietary search and merchandising improvement; and four, growth in the sale of [Technical Difficulty]. Hosting and Presence revenue was $151 million in Q3, up about 15% year-over-year. We currently reaped nearly 5 million aggregate customers with our Hosting and Presence products, including those customers who use either our easy and effective Website Builder products and more sophisticated audiences, those customers have build the site with open source tools and host it on our hosting infrastructure. Unlike many point solutions, we address a full range of online presence needs, serving our customers from those who want to build a site on their own to web professionals who need more capability to build sites for others. Just as important, we believe that a successful online presence requires not just a website, but tools and capabilities to extend the sites content everywhere it needs to be online. A great example of this strategy in action is our Search Engine Visibility tool, which Blake mentioned in his introductory comments. We are also having success combining our Hosting and Presence tools with those in our business applications offerings such as email, productivity and email marketing. In Q3, our business applications revenue was $45 million, up 47% year-over-year. This product category continues to be driven by strong growth in both productivity and email marketing. In Q3, we reached 2 million paying customers for business applications products. Blake and I get asked a lot about what\u2019s next in our product roadmap for business apps. Importantly, we see plenty of growth opportunity just in our existing product categories. We also know there is value in many adjacent product areas where our customers spend a lot of money and there is ample room for innovation, whether it would be in online presence, marketing solutions or technical infrastructure. We have proven we can extend our model into other areas, but it\u2019s also very clear to us that doing a few things really well and with distinction is the winning approach. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve done over the last couple of years and it served our customers and GoDaddy well. In addition to innovating and extending our product portfolio, we are increasingly bundling our products, bringing domains, basic presence and email and productivity products together in introductory offers. We have learned that when we make it easy for customers to attach and use our core products like site builder or email, they renew at very healthy rates and have attractive long-term economics. One example of this bundling and merchandising strategy is our offer of a free email with the Website Builder purchase. Attaching a domain specific email like Blake at blakesblog.com creates a more professional appearance and it makes a domain and website that much more valuable to our customers. Now an important point and bundling is that when we sell products at a package price, payment is allocated among the product types being sold in the bundle based on the list price of the individual products. As a result, our bundling strategy may shift revenue recognition across product lines in the short-term. However, our focus is on lifetime spend of our customers in aggregate. When you look at the growth rates of our three business lines, these allocations shifted a bit of growth from Hosting and Presence line to the Business Applications in the third quarter. We are 100% focused on maximizing the aggregate lifetime value of our customers and we will continue to explore pricing and bundling strategies that grow total spend and lifetime value at the customer level. We should also mention the impact of the stronger dollar on our top line growth. In recent quarters, I said our bookings growth would have been roughly 200 basis points higher if measured in constant currency. As bookings translate into revenue over time, that currency impact shows up in our GAAP numbers. Given the lag between bookings and revenue, we are now seeing the currency impact that affected bookings in the first half of the year show up in GAAP revenue. International revenue, which represents close to 26% of our total now, grew 17% on a reported basis in Q3, but keep in mind that the currency impact that I just mentioned in total really applies directly to this portion of the revenue base. Our underlying international business remains strong across all our key markets and we feel good about the underlying growth trajectory and health of our overseas offerings. In fact, we just topped 14 million \u2013 excuse me, we just topped 4 million international customers during the quarter and that\u2019s double the number of international customers we had just 4 years ago. Turning to my second overall point on our growing profitability, we continue to deliver strong cash flow. Adjusted EBITDA grew over 22% in Q3 to $88 million, yielding a margin of over 21%, a gain of 120 basis points versus Q3 of last year. Unlevered free cash flow grew over 40% in Q3 to $80 million, roughly in line with our nine-month growth of 42%. So far in 2015, we have converted over 90% of our adjusted EBITDA into unlevered free cash flow at the high end of our long-term target of 70% to 90% conversion. We finished Q3 with approximately $333 million in cash and short-term investments and net debt of $753 million or about 2.4 times our 2015 adjusted EBITDA. We are delivering these levels of strong bottom line performance, while continuing to invest in the business. We have been and will continue to hire engineers across all our applications and are investing in marketing, care and our ongoing international expansion. Our strong cash and balance sheet position also allows us to pursue value-creating acquisitions, where and if buying businesses, technology or customers complement our strategy and provide distinctive return above our organic opportunities. Our performance both in the third quarter and year-to-date, clearly reflect the leverage in our financial aid and operating model as one our product innovation continues to drive better attachment, high-margin products beyond domains; two, our global technology platform creates scale in our infrastructure spend; and three, we scale G&A. We feel well positioned to deliver this solid combination of top and bottom line growth into the future. Turning to our outlook, we are raising our 2015 guidance ranges for both revenue and adjusted EBITDA. For revenue, we expect full year 2015 to be $1.603 billion to $1.606 billion, implying approximately 16% growth versus 2014. This translates into Q4 revenues of $421 million to $424 million, implying approximately 14% growth versus prior year, in line with the long-term revenue expectations that we have shared before even while absorbing the currency impact mentioned earlier on the call. For cash flow, we are raising our full year adjusted EBITDA range to $334 million to $337 million, implying a Q4 range of $70 million to $73 million. The midpoint of our full year adjusted EBITDA range implies nearly 24% growth year-over-year. We also expect unlevered free cash flow in excess of $280 million in 2015, implying approximately 83% to 84% conversion of adjusted EBITDA into unlevered free cash flow and year-over-year growth of over 46%. More importantly, looking forward, we are well positioned for continued growth at scale in 2016 and beyond. We serve a huge market of small businesses, organizations and individuals who are looking to build an online presence. We deliver a true lifecycle experience to these customers that combine product, tech and care in a distinctively way. And the products and services that we offer grow with our customers over time. This value proposition translates into a proven financial model with great customer unit economics and strong and consistent revenue and cash flow growth. For those of you who are building models, we would like to reinforce our long-term targets of low-teens to mid-teens organic top line growth coupled with 20% plus adjusted EBITDA growth and unlevered free cash flow growth in the mid-20s. As we continue our growth trajectory, not just in the coming quarter or two quarters, but through 2016 and beyond. Given our strong cash flow and balance sheet position, we are also well positioned to pursue additional growth through inorganic [ph] activity into adjacent and complementary products and geographies. So to wrap up, we feel great about Q3 and our continued execution and we are focused on delivering for our customers and our shareholders over time. We believe GoDaddy\u2019s unique combination of products, technology and care will continue to differentiate us in the market and produce strong future financial results. With that, let\u2019s open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Deepak Mathivanan : Thanks, guys. Congrats on a good quarter. Two questions for me. First question on international, we saw you saw launched online store in India during 3Q. Can you elaborate on what big markets do you currently offer the site builder and business apps fully customized for local languages? How should we think about the focus for international next year with respect to entering into new market up-selling and existing ones? And then I have a follow-up about bundling. Scott Wagner : Hey, Deepak, it\u2019s Scott. So, in the international, I guess, your second question first. So, first and foremost, we are going to continue to expand in the markets in which we are in, which are primarily the European and Latin American markets. And then second we will, in 2016, enter a variety of the Asian markets. To address your first point on online store and site builder, each of those are primarily localized in Tier 1 markets now and there is a roadmap to get them into Tier 2 markets and the geographies I just mentioned and obviously then following in the Asian launch. Blake Irving : Yes, Deepak, this is Blake. Just to pilot on Scott\u2019s comments, next year more specifically just to drill into Asia a little bit, first quarter will enter with a core set of products, which will include website builder and not necessarily online stores, some key markets with online store, because payment types are little more tricky, but we will enter Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, South Korea and Japan and of course China as well with a core set of products that we offer domains, hosting, website builder, email, productivity. So you should think of those as being the core on online store in select markets where we think there is good opportunity for us and we have payment types that are appropriate for the marketplace. Deepak Mathivanan : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then second on product bundling, I think the integrated email marketing app being offered into the site builder on the online store, it makes a lot of sense, it requires no incremental marketing spend. But now that you have had it for say, two quarters roughly, can you qualitatively talk about the adoption rates that you are seeing for these apps from the initiatives in the last two quarters? And then what other opportunities would you characterize are left still untapped with respect to such cross-selling? Thanks. Blake Irving : Yes. So, this is Blake, Deepak. So, qualitatively, we are seeing pretty good uptake in the way that if you have actually used the site builder, you will note that when we surface these things, we are actually using data science to determine when the appropriate time to surface that capability is. So, in the case of email marketing, when we see that somebody has had 25 people signed up on a website to get feedback, we will surface email marketing for them in the time of need. We are also doing similar things with mail. So, servicing the ability to go by mail, so when you show up in somebody\u2019s inbox, you show up with a very personalized domain name. It says blake@blakeirving.com versus blake1535@gmail.com and that matters a lot. And I will just say we are really early in this still. So, a couple of quarters, we are learning and there is machine learning involved in this as well, so it\u2019s both people and machine learning. And we are continuing to iterate and if you think about the offer that we have got, we have folks that are in a life cycle. In small businesses, we are generally a lifecycle type of business. And as they move from I get a domain to I set up a website, now I am actually having some success, I would have surfaced the capability that\u2019s going to allow me to go retain or acquire more customers, we are getting more business. And that continuum of entering new product capability as somebody is growing with us really makes a difference to our customers and I think we are seeing some of that lift and you are certainly seeing it in the biz apps number. Deepak Mathivanan : It makes sense. Thanks, Blake. Congrats on the good quarter. Blake Irving : Thanks, Deepak. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Jason Helfstein : Thanks. Down here between two calls here. So, I am going to do my best. I am not sure if you commented yet on what drove the lower CPA in the quarter, it just seems like we are seeing really good marketing leverage. And then we saw clearly good margin in the quarter you are expecting uptrend in the fourth quarter, can you comment on kind of initial expectations for next year as far as margin trends? Thanks. Scott Wagner : Hey, Jason, it\u2019s Scott. To your last question first on margin trends, as we look into next year, we are well positioned for kind of 20% growth in adjusted EBITDA. And I think that\u2019s the playbook really that\u2019s been propelling us throughout this year, which is really nice growth across our product lines with faster growth in the non-domain products that are carrying higher gross margins. And then we are getting real scale that\u2019s starting to show up. You have seen it over the last quarters, but in our tech and dev, particularly on our infrastructure and G&A and that\u2019s going to continue frankly into next year with continuing and ongoing spend in marketing and care to support our growth, but the nice balance kind of creates the algorithm that you have been seeing, which is nice top line growth and even more flow through to the bottom line. Jason Helfstein : And then on the CPA in the quarter? Scott Wagner : Yes. I think on the quarter, it\u2019s again \u2013 it\u2019s tough to sort of look at CPA one quarter or the other. And so the marketing spend, some of it, obviously, they will show up in the quarter, but some of it has some drag. And so I am not sure we are going to jump up and down and take great credit for that one in the quarter necessarily. But again, we just feel good about the ongoing marketing return that we are getting and having that show up in a very consistent cohort level of spend over time. Jason Helfstein : Maybe just one follow-up. Following Endurance\u2019s announced intention to acquire Constant Contact, do you guys think this signals consolidation generally in the space and overall thoughts? Blake Irving : No. Jason, this is Blake. So, look I think if you take Constant Contact acquisition by itself, it\u2019s interesting it\u2019s a logical move for them. The proximity of the businesses makes sense. They are both Boston locals. We have examined the email market for a couple of years and need the customers clearly have. And we are more of an organic grower than we are an acquirer of customer revenue and we have been growing organically. We did acquire a very small company and I will tell you, so we did an exhaustive research around the space over the last couple of years and found on a variety of different qualitative measures and quantitative measures and found one that we loved that had incredibly high NPS and the best product experience in Mad Mimi. And we purchased a small company and frankly integrated a product called GoDaddy Email Marketing. That\u2019s what we were just talking to Deepak about his question. And have integrated that into our product suite in a way that is surfaced when somebody would most need it. And we think that\u2019s the key. So, it\u2019s less about consolidation and more about customer need. And we think that those logical extensions that customers that our little tiny business customers or small business customers really wanted to do next to make their business important. And Scott, I don\u2019t know if you have got any comments on top of that? Scott Wagner : Yes. I think what you are seeing is online presence is a category really being created for the small businesses and organizations that are all using cloud software. And there is a variety of point solutions across a broad set of categories. And from our standpoint, having those products work very well together is real advantage for our customers and obviously for us too and it\u2019s a very big market, it\u2019s expanding and there is a bunch of different ways for things to happen and play out. I think overall the fact that you do see consolidation in certain parts of it kind of validates the value proposition that we are providing and frankly reinforces I think some of our unique strengths around being able to create a bunch of need states across things and time together that creates real value. Jason Helfstein : Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Andrew Bruckner : Thank you. This is Andrew on for Mark. I just had one question on ARPU. As we think about you expanding into Asia kind of the continued FX headwinds and the bundling, should we think about ARPU growth is slowing down here or how do we think about it in the medium, short term? Thank you. Scott Wagner : Yes, thanks, Andrew. It\u2019s Scott. It\u2019s good. First, I think at an overall level, we are balancing our adds and growth of customers, which certainly drives the long-term value and the monetization of our existing customers, which more shows up in the ARPU. And in ARPU, there is three things happening. I mean, number one is really now and in the second half, we are lapping a number of pretty big ARPU enhancing moves from last year such as Managed WordPress and our big aggressive ramp on Office 365. Second is the FX impact, which you just brought forward and that is going to continue and that as you readily pointed out is some tempering of ARPU. And then third is the bundling and merchandising. And I think if you look at our ARPU at a shade under 7% for the quarter, in the quarters ahead you will probably see it in that mid single-digits line again, factoring in all three of these different things. Andrew Bruckner : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Cakmak with Monness, Crespi, Hardt. Your line is now open. James Cakmak : Alright. Thanks. At the end of the prepared remarks, you made some comments about your potential opportunities to explore inorganic growth through adjacencies just opened, could you expand on that a little bit? Blake Irving : Yes. Hi James, this is Blake. So I wont go into specifics about what categories we are looking at, but what I would say is that very small business customers have needs that are adjacencies that they are expecting what I would consider to be IT or tech dollars on with other providers, whether that\u2019s in marketing or communications those are things that they are doing that they are not pleased with the situation that they are in today, where they either don\u2019t get the results that they want from the marketing dollars they are spending or they feel like, they are not being served the same type of customer care that they get when they are dealing with us. So we think there are opportunities because we have that unique set of products, technology and care that allow us to go into adjacencies that are potentially very strong for us and we are exploring quite a few different areas that we think are the potential interesting growth areas for us that we would be adding. And then I have Scott? Scott Wagner : Hey James, I will just add two things quickly. The first thing is, look our trajectory is one of great organic growth right now. And the second point is we throw off a lot of cash. We have got very strong cash flow position and a nice position in our balance sheet and it\u2019s citing that we have been a great organic growth story. And obviously, our balance sheet position gives us the flexibility to add something inorganic if and so we choose and that it\u2019s additive to already what we are doing on the organic side. James Cakmak : Got it. Thanks. And then on the marketing side, one of the goals was to tackle the web professional market and so with all the marketing initiatives you have in place and I guess as we look forward, can you talk about on a go-forward basis, the traction that you are seeing with the higher value, higher LTV type of clients? Thanks a lot. Blake Irving : Yes. James, this is Blake. So we are super early for just two quarters into this web professional push we have, slightly under 60,000 web pros that are now in that program. And frankly, web professionals do spend more than small businesses, because we are usually managing more than one small business. So on a cohort basis, we expect to see some \u2013 a good trend, but now we are really early in this process and still rolling out features, in fact rolling of features as we speak that matter to these guys and allow them to manage their small business clients in a way that they haven\u2019t been able to do at scale before. And we have rolled that out internationally, in fact 50% of the folks that are in the web program are coming from international markets and cohorts spend internationally is the same as it is in the U.S. So we are optimistic, but we are really early innings on this one. James Cakmak : Thanks. Blake Irving : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. Your line is now open. Mark May : Thanks. We saw a lot of leverage in your customer care line in the quarter, I am just wondering if you could shed a little light on kind of what drove that in the period and kind of how to think about it going forward. And then in terms of the ARPU growth in the quarter, maybe I am sorry if I missed this, but maybe if you can walk through a little bit some of the drivers of the ARPU growth during the quarter. And then I guess the sunset of that is in terms of the international customer growth, what impact, if any does that have on sort of the average ARPU metric that you provide? Thanks. Scott Wagner : Yes. Thanks Mark. It\u2019s Scott. So first care, you are right we saw some leverage in the care line in Q3. And ongoing care, it\u2019s a balance for us between having time, energy with our customers and then getting them into products and that\u2019s something that we continue to invest in and we see that time is distinctive and valuable to us. But also adding, whether it\u2019s technology and CRM or call routing that helps us balance our staff more effectively or adding things like chat, which is becoming much more prevalent on our site and thinking in the quarter you are seeing frankly, a bunch of investments that we have been making around using technology to both balance our people and the customer interactions in the way that are still giving us high value touch, but are also helping us scale of a cost structure. Look going-forward we are going to continue to manage this balance. And to think about the care being roughly in line with growth possibly with a little bit of scale, but as we expand around the world, obviously that might be lumpy quarter-over-quarter. But we feel like, we are on a nice trajectory there. So I think that\u2019s one. Number two on ARPU growth, I think at the very simple level, you are just seeing the faster growth in our non-domain products in both Hosting and Presence and business apps in particular. All of those products carry higher relative price points and so as more customers adopt those and those continue to grow faster, that\u2019s going to translate into ARPU. And that\u2019s got a bunch of little sub-segments to do it. But at the end of the day, it\u2019s faster growth in adoption in Hosting and Presence and business apps. And I think the third question on the international impact and how will it impact ARPU, that\u2019s part of how we have been balancing customer growth in ARPU as we are growing outside United States, some of those new customers are coming in at lower ARPUs and then they spent over time. Right now, we are managing that balance and its showing up in our results. And if we continue to expand in other markets at the economics that exist today, then it\u2019s going to be great. And look, I think I have just a point to call it the FX impact absolutely does show up in not only ARPU, but particularly the international line, the international ARPU as well. And we are going to be dealing with that for the next several quarters. Mark May : Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Your line is now open. Michael Turrin : Hey guys. This is actually Michael on for Brent. Thanks for taking my questions. Just on the business applications segment, I know you talked about having already lapped 365 and the growth rate there is still very strong and you also just spoke to the aggregate between hosting in that segment, just wondering if we could dig a bit more into the expected trajectory of that business and what you are seeing the most success with that? Blake Irving : This is Blake, Brent \u2013 Michael, sorry. The overall business we think will continue to grow at approximately the same rate you are seeing now, so that 47% growth we feel very good about and there will be some as we have talked about the way that the bundling works. There will be some fluidity between the web hosting, the web hosting and presence line and business apps line. But overall, we feel like the non-domain businesses, which are higher margin business for us, we will continue to do well and continue to pace at the paces with a pretty strong level. Michael Turrin : Great. And then we have talked a bit about international on the Q&A, I think that at one point I saw a goal of 60 countries in 2016, can you just talk about are you still on track for that particular clip and how that figures into the next year on expansion? Blake Irving : Yes. Look, we are on track right now to be very, very close to that number. And frankly, we have \u2013 we are focused on Asia. You heard me rattle off the countries, I think there is 11 of them that we will roll in the first quarter, which would bring our overall market count to 53, so that\u2019s getting pretty darn close to 60 and there is a lot of the year left for some other markets. And frankly, for us it\u2019s focusing not just on country expansion, but performance in country and making sure that the Tier 1 countries that we identify is our biggest opportunities are performing well and that we are actually making sure that we are bouncing our spend in those countries. As you know and on a software product, you can go into countries with very, very little cost and it\u2019s almost our marketing, so the way that we are going to work that marketing levers over the course of 2016 will be incredibly important for us as we roll these things out. By the end of 2016, we will be in most of the markets that really make a difference for the business and that\u2019s, if we just get away from the 60 number and think about what\u2019s really going to a sense for the business, we are going to be there, which is a really important thing. And then you think about companies that are providing a platform for various businesses, there will be nothing close. That is targeting a very small business in that many marketplaces today. Michael Turrin : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mitch Bartlett with Craig-Hallum Capital Group. Your line is now open. George Kelly : Hi guys. This is George on for Mitch. Just one question, you mentioned in your prepared remarks a product you are launching that helps with in app discovery, and wasn\u2019t totally clear on that, so wondering if you could just explain that a bit further? Blake Irving : Yes. It is not a product George, as much as it is a capability. So if you think about a scenario where I have Website Builder product and I am going to go into make a quick change or a view or just viewing my website. And I have had 25 individuals signed up for \u2013 to be contacted by me at some point. When we know that they have reached a critical mass, a critical number, we can toggle that number up or down on market. We can introduce just a button that says hey, try email marketing right now and introduce that at that incredibly important point in that small businesses life cycle that surface the ability for them to discover and then use and then try in a free trial way, try that product out. And then when they get the certain scale, then they will start paying for it. But it\u2019s a great way for discovery of a product to be within another product to give it that way. And frankly, we are doing this with email, we are doing it with email marketing and there are other places you can imagine us doing this over time that will make a lot of sense for these small business customers, did that make sense? George Kelly : Okay. Thanks. It does, yes. Thanks. Blake Irving : Okay, you bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Brian Essex : Hi, good afternoon and thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if we can talk a little bit about Hosting and Presence, I think you guys have already kind of touched on the tax rates, but what are you seeing in that segment, I think while business applications certainly beat our expectations, I think Hosting was kind of more in line-ish, just what you are seeing in terms of initiatives, performance to expectations and then how we might anticipate kind of growth going forward given the initiatives that you have in the pipeline right now? Scott Wagner : Yes. Thanks Brian. It\u2019s Scott. So I guess, as mentioned and what we talked about, our bundling and merchandising approach where we are increasingly bringing Business Applications both email and email marketing into our Hosting products is actually moving some of the growth from Hosting and Presence in the business apps. And so I think when you look at those two in totality and we look at it and think about it, the growth is really strong and healthy. And we just \u2013 we think that this bundling approach is really impactful because it\u2019s number one, contextual. And number two it reduces a lot of friction. And so and what we have learned and see is that when people are using our products, they don\u2019t go anywhere. And so we continue to experiment, not just with the offer, but how we can make it really easy for customers in the right context the relevant way to sample, try, begin to use our different products at the right time in their lifecycle. And we know when they do that, it works out for them and it works for us. So punch line on Hosting and Presence and apps is you are just seeing a little bit of a shift to the dollar growth, kind of from Hosting and Presence go over the business apps because of some of this bundling. Brian Essex : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Maybe take a follow-up of the domain side. As we see more ccTLDs and gTLDs kind of enter the market, what kind of tools do you use to gauge your penetration of the market, maybe relative to your peers? I mean, one of the things that I like about your platform is it seems that you almost have like a nice scaled management layer whereas some of your peers are smaller and don\u2019t have as many registry relationships. So, with all the choice that you have, one of the questions I get, I mean, does the source of this question is investors are often asking me how do we know about who is gaining more share and who is positioned in different ways in the domain market and curious to think \u2013 curious to hear how you look at it given the platform that you have and the visibility that you have in the market? Scott Wagner : Hey, Brian, it\u2019s Scott. But let me try the share gain one first. So think about share, certainly, there is .com in the gTLDs and then there is the different ccTLDs. And obviously, zone files from VeriSign are both published and easily accessible and we have a regular, frankly, automated dashboard, where we can swizzle .com in any country, situation around the world and track and measure our share. Over the last couple of years, as we have been entering our countries in localized form, one little execution part of that has been to establish data feeds with the registries in each of those countries to also track and measure ccTLDs. So, in our Tier 1 markets, we also are measuring and tracking our ccTLDs share and frankly, in all of our Tier 1 markets, it\u2019s going up. So, we look at both in their individual component parts, but more importantly overall, because I think this gets to the most interesting thing and is what you let into, which is our platform is now in a position where in a geography or in a market, we can surface certain kinds of products in some markets that maybe a ccTLD and others it\u2019s .com, individually, with different price points, sometimes together and have automated \u2013 frankly, the infrastructure in the platform to be able to do that kind of market price product independent. And again, that\u2019s one of those things that is just starting to rollout and we think this is going to be a big help and it\u2019s just one of the many ways that a platform plays out into making things very localized and relevant and good business for us. Blake Irving : Yes. Just to pile on, Brian, so, a couple of things I think are important to note. I think the way that we have done a proprietary search algorithm is insanely fast and it also allows us to surface any TLD that\u2019s appropriate based on the word breaking that we have done in the search query. So, actually it\u2019s a very advanced word-breaking across the search. We can surface TLDs from any registry that are appropriate for that particular search query. And it\u2019s delivered frankly a 10% growth rate for us in an industry that\u2019s not growing at 10%. So, we continue like basically double the growth rate. So, we are continuing to take share in the TLDs that we play in today, which are the big ones as well, the .com and the .nets. And frankly, having 20% of the world\u2019s domains under management and 61 million domains under management is important. So leadership here is incredibly important to us and we are going to continue to innovate and put great engineers on these \u2013 great engineers and great UX people on these problems. And we know that when you own that domains on ramp, it\u2019s the first thing that people do when they have an idea, they go buy a domain and then the next thing they do is go attach something to it. And it\u2019s a key driver not just for the domains business, but for the rest of our business as well and you will see us continuing to work there and make really good investments. Brian Essex : Great. Very helpful. Thank you very much. Blake Irving : Thank you. Operator : And there are no further questions on the lines at this time. I will now turn the call back to the presenters. Blake Irving : Hey, everyone. This is Blake. I just wanted to thank you all for standing on the phone for \u2013 standing or sitting on the phone for the last hour hearing our comments and asking questions. So, we have had a great third quarter. We feel good about it. And we look forward to talking with you next quarter. Bye now. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

My name is Connor and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the GoDaddy fourth quarter earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Marta Nichols, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Marta Nichols : Thank you, Connor. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for GoDaddy's fourth quarter 2015 earnings call. With me today are Blake Irving, Chief Executive Officer and Scott Wagner, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Blake and Scott have some prepared remarks, which will follow with a question-and-answer session. On today's call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, such as total bookings, adjusted EBITDA, unlevered free cash flow, net debt, ARPU and constant currency. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their nearest GAAP equivalents maybe found in today's press release, presentation posted to our IR website at investors.godaddy.net or on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC with today's earnings release. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, February 17, 2016 and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. I will now turn the call over to Blake. Blake Irving : Thanks Marta and thanks to all of you for joining us today. GoDaddy's fourth quarter was a good one with contributions from all of our major product lines driving strong topline growth and exceptional cash flow. The strength of our execution and our financial results have remained just as consistent as the vision we shared with you on our roadshow last year : Our vision is to radically shift the global economy toward small business by helping individuals easily start, confidently grow and successfully run their own ventures. Millions of global customers use our growing suite of elegant, easy-to-use and increasingly integrated cloud-based products, built on a single global technology platform and supported by outcome-driven, personalized customer care to create a successful online presence. I would like to share three big themes around our recent progress and accomplishments with everyone today : First, we are consistently posting strong financial performance and growth. Second, we are continuing to expand our portfolio and our geographic footprint with our recent entry into Asia. And third, we are making meaningful shifts in the way we communicate with our customers through merchandising and marketing. On my first point on our business results, GoDaddy's unique combination of great products, fast, reliable and high performance technology and empathetic customer care continue to differentiate what we do and have together yielded a large, high-growth business with strong cash flow. At the end of 2015, we have grown to serve nearly 13.8 million customers, an increase of more than one million customers versus a year ago. Our annual average revenue per user, or ARPU, rose over 6% to $121 at year-end, in spite of currency headwinds. Q4 bookings grew nearly 17% on a constant currency basis, or over 13% on a reported basis, to $464 million. Our strong customer and ARPU growth together drove our fourth quarter revenue up 17% in constant currency, or over 14% on a reported basis, to $425 million for the quarter. Full year bookings grew to over $1.9 billion and revenue rose to $1.6 billion, both up over 17% in constant currency. Our adjusted EBITDA jumped 30% to almost $74 million in the fourth quarter, bringing our full year adjusted EBITDA to over $337 million, an increase of more than 24%. For the year, we converted over 87% of adjusted EBITDA into unlevered free cash flow, near the high end of our long-term expectations. And we feel great about our delivery of consistently strong topline growth, expanding margins and nearly $300 million in unlevered free cash flow for our shareholders in 2015. On my second point about our expanding product portfolio and geographic footprint, we reached another major milestone in our company's history in January 2016 with the launch of key new markets in Asia, bringing our total there to 10 languages and 14 markets, including Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. With this launch, we are now in 26 languages and 53 markets globally. When customers in these markets visit GoDaddy today, they see content that looks and feels local. Our scalable technology platform enabled us to roll out these Asian markets simultaneously, including a localized suite of GoDaddy products and ccTLDs, with advanced personalization and flexibility, like allowing customers to toggle between languages and switch currencies, payment types and more. At the same time, we also deployed a new in-region customer care team and facility in Dalian, China providing local language care for all these new markets. Today, when a customer in South Korea comes to godaddy.com, they are directed to kr.godaddy.com. They see Korean language and imagery on our site and in our products. They have the ability to pay in dollars or Won and when they need help, they call a local phone number and have the ability to speak with a care professional in our Dalian care center in Korean. Launching across Asia immediately after closing the books on our very strong 2015 illustrates the power of our strategy and our financial model. We brought all these new countries online and launched local language support in Asia simultaneously, even as we were continuing to grow the business in 2015 and delivered huge unlevered free cash flow growth. This demonstrates our ability to meaningfully expand the markets we serve and produce operating leverage in our model at the same time. We have steadily and deliberately expanded our overseas presence over the last several years from English-speaking markets to Latin America to Europe and now Asia. International countries now contribute more than a quarter of our annual revenue and in 2016, we expect more new customers to come from international markets than from the U.S. for the first time, which is a huge move for a company that was nearly entirely focused on the domestic market just a few years ago. My third theme for this call is directly connected with our growing global presence. We are making a real shift in how we communicate with our customers, including both how we market to them and invite them to experience GoDaddy as well as how we present and bundle products to better match customer needs. One example of this is a clear shift you have seen in our approach to marketing. As you know, we already have over 80% brand awareness in the U.S., so we have been strategically shifting our marketing effort from singular big brand and mostly U.S. events, which focus primarily on driving name recognition, to increasing our customer touches through much broader reach and greater frequency at the top of the customer acquisition funnel. Well, you saw this illustrated in our approach to the Super Bowl this year. Instead of spending on a traditional 30-second spots sponsoring the broadcast game, we reached a sizable audience through digital channels, notably social and display, which included video content from Fox Sports, pre-game, free-time and post-game feeds, more social ads and a major presence across a number of large digital publishers like CBS Sports. In 2016, you will see several major extensions of this new marketing strategy : First, we are planning a larger and much more consistent presence in top-of-the-funnel channels like TV and radio throughout the year versus singular events and sponsorships of years past. Second, you will see more deliberate and consistent linkages between our top-of-funnel customer acquisition activity and our mid-funnel, especially in digital channels, similar to our multi-channel Super Bowl approach this year. Third, you will see brand creative and messaging that are distinctive and resonate specifically with the value proposition we offer our customers. This is a real change for GoDaddy and the right approach as we build on our exceptional brand awareness and push to extend our reach globally. As we market more consistently throughout the year, we expect to see more balance in our business pacing throughout the quarters of the year versus the seasonally stronger Q1 we saw in past years, which is also absolutely the right approach. Another example of our changing approach to how we interact with our customers is the product bundling Scott mentioned on our last earnings last call. You know that historically domains was really our primary customer on ramp. Over the last couple of years, we have presented customers a much broader range of offerings, often merchandising and marketing domains, presence and/or email together with introductory offers to make it super easy for customers to get started. When we make it easy for customers to attach and use our core products like site-building or email, they renew at very healthy rates and have attractive long-term economics. Our evolving approach to marketing, product presentation and bundling are all designed to better engage with our customers and address our increasingly global audience. Look, we feel really good about the quarter and the year. I am super proud of what our teams across the company delivered in 2015. We launched new capabilities with a comprehensive and just wicked-fast domain search, added over 100 new top level domains, expanded our domain aftermarket liquidity and grew to 62 million domains under management. We introduced our GoDaddy Pro tools, launched our new Search Engine Visibility service and we rolled out hundreds of features, performance and availability improvements across the company as well as filling out our international foot print to 53 markets and 26 languages. That all feels very good and creates a great foundation for growth in the years ahead. And as an aside and before I turn it over to Scott, just yesterday I noticed another timely proof point that reinforces the incredible importance of owning one's personal identity and presence online. I would encourage you all to check out what's presented when you type jebbush.com into your browser. Whether you are a presidential candidate, a small business or even a sellside analyst, I think we can all agree that with the increasing importance that the Internet plays on our daily lives, claiming and owning your digital identity just continues to become more and more important. Now let me turn the call over to Scott now to talk about the financial results in more detail. Scott? Scott Wagner : Thanks Blake. There's three key financial points that I would like to cover with everyone today : First, we continue to deliver strong, consistent revenue growth with a really nice balance between customer and ARPU increases. As Blake said, our bookings grew 17% in constant currency in Q4 or 13% on a reported basis. Revenue also grew 17% in constant currency or 14% reported. Looking at our two revenue drivers, customers grew nearly 9% during the last year and we ended Q4 with approximately 13.8 million paying customers. Our annual average revenue per user or ARPU grew over 6% to $121, up from $114 a year ago, even while absorbing the impact of the stronger dollar. Second, we are consistently delivering even faster growth in cash flow. Adjusted EBITDA grew over 30% year-over-year in the quarter and frankly, we had spectacular performance in unlevered free cash flow with an increase of more than 145% last quarter and more than 50% growth for the full year 2015 versus 2014. Those are great gains in our two key profitability measures, achieved while we continued to invest in growth. Third, we feel well-positioned to continue delivering a solid combination of top and bottomline growth going forward. I will provide some color on the performance of our three product lines. First, domains revenue finished the quarter at $218 million, up 9% year-over-year. Our domains business continues to be fueled by international growth, strong and improved renewals and continued expansion in the domains aftermarket. While in recent months, we have received a handful of questions about China, specifically on the surge of domain registrations coming from Mainland China in Q4 and how it's affected us. Here's some background. For several months in Q3 and Q4, interest in short domain names spiked in China, particularly those with three to six characters, both in Pinyin and numeric names. Now, the vast majority of those registrations were done through Chinese-based registrars, often at below cost, so that activity didn't affect our results. We do believe that most of the incremental registrations were by local Chinese domain investors. Now, the surge was positive for our domain aftermarket business as we facilitated the secondary sale of several short character names, given our unique position as the largest domain marketplace in the world. While the surge in the primary market didn't affect us, we do see it as great proof point of the value of domains in character-based languages and the prospect for our growth in Asia over time. With our January launch of localized GoDaddy offerings in Asian markets and languages, we look forward to building our presence and participation in those markets in a meaningful way going forward. The interest we saw in the purchase and sale of domain names in the aftermarket also highlights the value of domain names as unique digital assets with real value. With our growing domain marketplace, we are well positioned to help grow the global aftermarket in names and make these secondary name transactions both easier and more transparent for our customers and for the industry. Now, today Asia is still very small for us, generating less than 4% of our total company bookings. We are excited about our recent launches and the opportunity to build those markets into a more meaningful business for us over time. This will be a multi-year process that I will address a little bit more when I discuss our outlook. Now, turning to our products beyond naming. Our hosting and presence revenue was $156 million in Q4, up about 13% year-over-year. As Blake mentioned, we are increasingly bundling our products bringing domains, our basic presence offerings and email and productivity products together in introductory offers, which we believe will benefit renewals and the long-term economics and value of our customers over time. Recall that when we sell products in a bundle, revenue gets allocated across all the products in the bundle according to their list prices. Bundling like this, for example, combining our website building tool with free Office 365, shifts revenue recognition among product lines in the short-term, but our focus is always on the overall lifetime spend of our customers in aggregate. When you look at the growth rates of our three business lines this quarter, it shifted several hundred basis points of growth to business applications from our domains and hosting and presence lines in the fourth quarter. Business applications revenue of $52 million accelerated to growth of 50% year-over-year in Q4, driven by continued strong growth in both productivity and email marketing and the bundling effect I just mentioned. Like all companies with a meaningful international presence, our 2015 topline growth also reflected the impact of currency, which became more pronounced through 2015. For the full-year 2015, bookings growth would have been 17% or 320 bps higher and revenue growth would have also been 17% or about 140 bps higher in constant currency. Most importantly, we remain happy about our international growth and our future prospects. Our international business now represents 26% of total revenue and grew 25% in constant currency in Q4. Over the last three years, we have grown share and accelerated growth in our primary non-U.S. markets at attractive economics. Looking ahead, we are going to continue to focus on extending our gains in Asia, the U.K. and other key geographies while building up our Asia business. Turning to profitability, we continue to deliver strong cash flow. I mentioned adjusted EBITDA grew over 30% in Q4 to $74 million and for the full-year, EBITDA grew over 24% to $337 million, producing a 21% margin, a gain of 140 basis points versus 2014. Unlevered free cash flow was up dramatically, growing 147% in Q4 to $52 million, bringing our full-year unlevered free cash flow to $294 million, a gain of almost 54% versus 2014. In 2015, we converted 87% of adjusted EBITDA into unlevered free cash flow, near the high end of our long-term target range of 70% to 90%. Now, just a minor note on our operating cost lines in Q4. Two items in the fourth quarter a year ago produced somewhat unusual growth for a couple of our cost lines. Specifically, our tech and dev costs would have grown a bit faster than we reported in Q4, more like 7% year-over-year and our G&A growth would have been quite a bit slower or about 8% year-over-year without the non-recurring items in the year-ago quarter. Looking forward, both tech and dev and G&A should continue to be sources of leverage for us in 2016. Now overall our combination of strong top and bottom line performance demonstrates the inherent leverage in our operating model, allowing us to steadily grow the topline, invest in growth across the business and deliver excellent unlevered free cash flow, all of which contributed to delevering the balance sheet throughout 2015. We finished the year with approximately $353 million in cash and short term investments and net debt of $731 million or about 2.2 times our 2015 adjusted EBITDA. So turning to our outlook for 2016. Today we are providing guidance for revenue and adjusted EBITDA for both the first quarter of 2016 and the full-year. Our strategy is designed to generate consistent, steady growth over the long term and that's reflected in our outlook, which is right in line with the expectations we shared with you at the time of the IPO and throughout all of last year. For Q1, we expect revenue in the range of $428 million to $432 million, implying approximately 14% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. For the full year 2016, we expect revenue of $1.82 billion to $1.845 billion, also implying approximately 14% growth at the midpoint. Now this outlook incorporates the continued impact of currency, as past bookings translate into revenue in 2016. In other words, without the dollar strength that trimmed bookings in 2015, our 2016 revenue outlook would have been a bit higher what I just shared. But even while absorbing this, the ranges are right in line with the long-term revenue expectations we had shared with everybody before. We expect adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter in the range of $111 million to $114 million and for the full-year 2016 of $400 million to $410 million. The midpoint of our full year adjusted EBITDA range implies 20% growth year-over-year, also in line with the long-term targets we have shared. Two quick comments on our 2016 expectations. First, this outlook incorporates the costs associated with our recent entry into the new markets in Asia, but relatively limited top-line impact from that region. We expect to spend 2016 tuning our product offerings and marketing in these countries to lay the foundation for a more meaningful contribution from these markets in 2017 and beyond. So although Asia won't dramatically affect our P&L much in 2016, we are excited about the long-term potential there as these geographies build into meaningful contributors over time. Second, Blake described our marketing evolution and specifically our focus on reinforcing our brand message more frequently and consistently throughout the year, as opposed to our historically big brand awareness push in Q1. As we broaden our marketing reach and expand the tactics that we use, our Q1 and full-year outlook reflect our expectation for slightly less first quarter seasonality than we have experienced in past years. But overall, I am taking a step back. We are well positioned for continued growth at scale in 2016 and beyond. We serve a huge market of small businesses, organizations and individuals who are looking to build an online presence. We deliver a true lifecycle experience to these customers that combine products, an integrated tech platform and care in a distinctive way. And the products and services that we offer grow with our customers over time. This value proposition translates into a proven financial model with great customer unit economics and strong and consistent overall revenue and cash flow growth. So to wrap, our Q4 performance and execution were strong and we are focused on continuing to deliver for our customers and our shareholders over time. With that, we will open it up for your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Scott Wagner : And hey everybody, while the operator gets the queue going, we understand that the phone line was cutting out a bit that during Blake's remarks. We apologize for that. Let us know if there was any elements that people need us to come back to during the Q&A. We are certainly happy to. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Your line is open. Ron Josey : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to spend a little more time on international expansion and the plans around Asia specifically. On international, I think Blake you said that more users have come from international this year than the U.S. So I just wanted to see if you can remind us, I think you said there are about four million international users as of 3Q, so maybe an update there. And then given Asia has just launched, to the Scott's point, where do you think these users would be coming from in 2016 going forward? I guess obviously your more established markets, but any specifics would be helpful. And then lastly on marketing, just any more details on how you plan to the grow that brand awareness in those 11 Asian countries throughout 2016 would be helpful. Thank you. Blake Irving : So we will try to knock those off at this point in order. So yes, roughly about four million customers internationally today. This year will be the first time that we will take on the more international customers than domestic customers, as we cross that last, more new customers, I should say, internationally. So very good for us. Which markets do the new customers come from? We see that coming primarily big Tier 1 markets, whether it's Brazil, the U.K., Canada, India and then we have got Tier 2 and Tier 3. But the majority are coming from those large Tier 1 markets. And honestly, we do brand spend in those big Tier 1 markets. That is something where we have feet on the street with top-of-the-funnel advertising. In Tier 2, we do things that are more search engine marketing and direct in-display. Brand spend in the U.S., U.K., Australia, India, Brazil and Mexico for the most part. And we have seen good uplift and good uplift of brand when we spend and when we do localize markets, when we globalize and make sure we are managing payment types and currencies and languages. As we spend into those markets, we see an immediate win. So we are pretty happy with what have been doing so for over the last few years internationally and think that Asia is going to follow that pattern, follow that same pattern that we have seen in both Latin America, Europe, India and the other English-speaking markets we cover. That cover it, Ron? Ron Josey : Thank you. Yes. That's great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Jason Helfstein : Great. Thanks. Maybe just two things. Products are becoming more important. Maybe talk about the mix and what you are offering is impacting the bundled packages? And then can you give us a sense of perhaps some product pipeline coming over the next 12 to 18 months? Thank you. Blake Irving : Yes. So Jason, I would characterize us as being a product portfolio of companies. So we actually have a number of products, both domains, presence and ecommerce and hosting and productivity. We have seen a slightly faster growth in our productivity area. We talked about 50% growth in that area. And the pipeline of offering that will come into the next in 12 and 18 months will be in the area of what we believe our customers are looking for. So you have seen our business shift from primarily being a domain businesses to being a much more of a portfolio of digital presence products that help people get found online, be able to transact with our customers, acquire customers, retain them and then help them run their back-office as well. And we are seeing good growth in business, both on digital presence and on productivity. Jason Helfstein : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Deepak Mathivanan : Great. Thanks. This is somewhat related to the prior question. Business applications revenue growth accelerated nicely for a few quarters since you launched email marketing. You call that bundling as one of the reasons for that due to the dollar shift. But can you perhaps qualitatively touch upon what the penetration rate currently is there, in terms of the total customer base and then how you are driving trade for that product? And can you also give some color on the adoption curve of the product? The email marketing product, which is Office 365 and professional email that you saw in the past? Scott Wagner : Hi, Deepak, it's Scott. So from a business applications standpoint, I think we have said cause whether we passed few million customers that are using one of our business applications products and so we continue to see nice increases in attach and as our products, both within productivity and email marketing, again continue to get more, let's call it robust, we are also seeing some nice movement and migration into high value packages within those SKUs. So as I have described and talked to you about before, look, we continue to use bundling as ways that allow our customers to easily acquire and activate these business application products because we found and our customers certainly find once they start using them, there is huge value and they renew for a long, long time. And so look, we are just going to continue to drive both attachment and activation of these. And over time, that [indiscernible] to these categories. Deepak Mathivanan : Got it. That's helpful. And another one for you, Scott. So refund rates, if I look at it as a percentage of bookings, it was creeping up slightly for the past few quarters, but seem to our stabilized in 4Q. Will you call out anything specific this quarter or is it just due to the mix shift in the business? Scott Wagner : We just keep running the business, Deepak. I think that stability is part of it, is a way to think about it. Deepak Mathivanan : Okay. Great. Thanks, Scott. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mitch Bartlett with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open. Mitch Bartlett : Sure. Maybe a question for Blake. Just could you describe what it is like to enter a new market? You just entered 10 Asian markets in early January. What are the assets and people that need to be in place? And maybe the initial product strategies? Or just what does it look like to start in a new market? And what will it look like over a number of years? I get that you are saying very little revenues from these Asian markets, but what does the trajectory look like for a normal market like, perhaps, Thailand or something like that? Blake Irving : Yes. So let me just talk quickly about how we approach international markets. First, our international markets for us is primarily mostly a software problem. So it's making sure that the code we have written is globalized and localizable, which means we are separating the function of the code away from language, away from market. And then in market you have both currency, you have payment type and you have imagery. We separate those things out that allows us, from a platform perspective, to have very small nuances in the products and to be able to enter markets with literally no personnel in five of those markets, with the exception of a singular care facility that can be in-region that manages the languages, the individual languages of those different markets. What we have found over the last couple of years when we have entered markets with that strategy, we have seen an immediate lift just because we were actually look a lot like a very local company who knows the market well. The India example, we entered in 2012. We ramped up products. We added a local care organization. We added marketing on top of that. And we have seen those 3X growth rate in India over time. So from a cost perspective, I will hand it over to Scott and let him talk about it. Scott Wagner : Thanks, Mitch. Let me just pickup on the India example that Blake just gave which is, you have got scaled engineering in a market ramping barren marketing which India drove a 3X-plus growth and has for the last three years. And so think about these markets that we are entering, first on their size, growth and competitive potential. So we are looking at these geographies and thinking okay, well where is their embedded growth, particularly in naming and the local competitive context, mostly which is just local people. And then we are purposefully in year one, for a couple of markets that are big and large and we think we got a way to really meaningfully accelerate growth, spending year one marketing dollars to activate customers. And based on the customer growth rate plus their spending profile, we are measuring the lifetime value relative to our cost of acquisition over time. And then frankly, we are spending marketing dollars into that market based on that attractiveness. And so what I am describing is a very clear formula for growth that frankly has been at work the last three years on our international markets. And I would encourage you and everybody to think about these Asian markets as just another play in the international playbook that we have been running for three years. Mitch Bartlett : All right. That's great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Vogel with Barclays. Your line is open. Paul Vogel : Great. Thanks. I just have two questions. The first, just in terms of big picture macro, any impact at all that you guys are seeing right now on the business? And is there anything you are guiding that would imply any change to the macro? And then I guess to a more modeling question, just when we look at margins for the business, how much of a mismatch is there between where you recognize your revenue and where you recognize your cost? So obviously you talked about FX neutral revenue growth, but is there a negative impact to margins based on a mismatch between revenue and cost? Scott Wagner : Hi Paul, it's Scott. I will take both. Look, on guidance, certainly one of the appeals of our business and financial model is that we do have quite a bit of predictability and visibility into growth. Look I think the biggest macro factor is, just what we are experiencing in currency. And if you think about the range that we just provided, I think movements in these dollar amounts which should have been pretty unpredictable is, more than anything else pushes towards one side of the range or the other. And again, relative to constant currency versus reported, we have got 200 to 300 basis points of impact happening now and that are going to show up in 2016. And so that's the macro factor. Frankly, the fundamentals of business of our market performance of our attachment, they are all doing great. So I think that's question number one. On two, bookings and EBITDA, we don't have a lot of costs that are actually sitting outside the United States. Again as Blake described, as we talked about international, we are in a scaled expansion model. And so we don't have a lot of cost that actually sit outside the U.S. and so our EBITDA performance and growth is actually reflective of a cost structure that largely, in terms of people, sits here in the United States. Paul Vogel : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Sterling Auty : Thanks. Hi guys. So I have got one question and one follow-up. The first question is, the comments that you made on seasonality, I am really interested, is it that you think that just changing the marketing programs is going to help smooth out because to your point, March has been the seasonally strongest quarter for the naming business, since in fact for 15-year plus. I am wondering, is that going to be enough to smooth things out? Or is there anything else that you think will help change the seasonality? Scott Wagner : Sterling, it's Scott. So first, it's a slight change. Again, we are a subscription business. We have a big amount of renewal business plus new business from existing customers. So from a quantum standpoint in the quarter, it's a relatively small amount, but it is a bit of a smoothing from Q1 into the quarters throughout the rest of the year. So truly it is not a huge change. It's a very moderate shift from Q1 into the other quarters. Does that make sense? Sterling Auty : It does. Scott Wagner : And to be clear, that's affecting bookings, right. Because bookings is the in-quarter billing. And so that slight taper and shift for 2016 is going to just be more reflected in bookings than GAAP revenue. Sterling Auty : And then just as a follow-up. The commentary about, I think you said renewal rates actually improved. I am kind of curios, are you seeing that across the board? Or is it a pickup in renewal rates, other customers that have more than just domain names? Just maybe a little bit more either qualitative or quantitative color on the improving renewal side? Scott Wagner : It's positive across frankly, our product categories. And again, I think it's slight change in improvements, not dramatic ones but again in a subscription business, renewal rates that are consistent and steady, particularly at our size and scale and what we are doing from expansion standpoints is fantastic within certainly even domains, but then around products and categories like productivity, we are seeing just nice metrics in renewal rates. But again I think if you are sitting there and thinking about models, put it into the category of light shift comfort in the business as we expand, but not a huge dramatic change that's going to show up next quarter. Sterling Auty : Got it. Thank you. Blake Irving : Sterling, this is Blake, real quickly. I would like to expand on Scott's comments. Well, what we have found is, as we improve the product and we start seeing better activation and usage and folks really enjoying the products and using them, we see folks renew at a much greater rate. Sterling Auty : That makes sense. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Brian Essex : Great. Thank you. Thank you for taking the question. Either Blake or Scott, I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about, I know it's early days, but some of the dynamics of what you are seeing in the new Asian markets and maybe relate that to India and what you have seen there, both from a pricing mix and attach rate perspective? Are you seeing a similar profile of customer? I have to imagine that in some ways it's different but maybe a little bit of color in terms of your initial take on penetration in those markets? Blake Irving : Sure, Brian. We have been in Asia, we have got customers in Asia for quite some time. So we have been doing analysis and modeling, the way that they look. The dynamics in Asia are quite similar to what we what we see in India. The mix of product is quite similar. Pricing in local currency is quite similar. And the customer profile generally is pretty homogenous in what they are trying to accomplish is the same. They are trying to get a digital presence, starting with the name and trying to attach a website to it and many a times an email address as well. So the dynamics for Asia are quite similar to other markets that we have entered in the last few years. Brian Essex : Okay. And is there anything about the experience that you have built penetrating other geographies that might make you do this more efficiently? What are some of the major things that you have learned whether it's India or Brazil or other geos that have been stumbling blocks upfront that maybe you solved that equation going into Asia? Blake Irving : Look, we certainly have gotten better. I think at entering just helps we have the experience in other countries. We have certainly learned about product deployment and product performance and how we do regional data centers that serve up speed and availability in the local markets. And then also how we spend into those markets in the top-of-funnel and mid-funnel. So we have spent time learning quite a bit on conversions and on how to really build products that our customers feel are local. They feel local. Scott Wagner : Brian, it's Scott. I would add two things. One is, the marketing spend and the activation into a market is similar. So we have done this now in a half-dozen plus big Tier 1 markets plus later and more direct spend in others and we are dilating our formula for how much and the tactics around how we enter the market and then grow it over time. And so that's been a big learning over the last three years and frankly it's just giving us confidence in our ability to enter additional markets and grow share and do so in a really scalable way. Brian Essex : Okay. Anything you would highlight as the biggest risk for you? What are the key things that you would have to get right as you penetrate that market? Blake Irving : This is Blake. The approach that we have taken in doing primarily software driven and spending into the market is very low risk for us. We learned quite a bit. We grew our way into that over time. And you will see us take the same approach. As Scott had said earlier, there is not a whole lot of dollars at work that are outside of the country. The engineering team that actually builds these capabilities are here in the U.S. and we see good leverage from the work that we have done in the U.S. and these markets truly take a lot of the risk out of the equation. Scott Wagner : And what really helps has been frankly just a very clear name centered offering translation and doing that with the local ccTLDs and price points and payments that allows people to get the name and start to build their online presence, which has been the foundation of the business has been the key to entering these geographies. So frankly more than anything else that's a thing I think has given us confidence in entering these categories because it's really anchored name and then connecting that name to a digital identity on a long-term approach. Brian Essex : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Cakmak with Monness, Crespi, Hardt. Your line is open. James Cakmak : Hi. Thanks. Just too please. So the first one on the gross margin. Obviously you guys been able to expand that every quarter now with the growth in high-margin categories. But no with the bundling that we saw last quarter, perhaps you should have expected somewhat of a slowdown in the rate of the gross margin expansion because of that bundling, but it was par with 3Q. So just how should we think about the potential of slowing of the leverage there as we look into 2016? And then secondly on the macro comments that you made, largely ForEx related. What we are seeing is a weakening SMB environment, at least domestically. Can you just talk a little bit about what you are seeing from small businesses in general at a high level? Thank you. Scott Wagner : James, it's Scott. I will take the gross margin one and then Blake can talk about the SMB environment. So on gross margin, you said it well and it's right, which is we have put up large gross margin expansion over the last six to seven quarters and we expect that to pretty much flatten .You have seen it taper at flattening out both as we bundle and merchandise and frankly think about some of the new categories that we are going to add and what that might mean from just a gross margin percentage profile. But again, the incremental products that we are adding and the merchandising approach, from a dollar basis and a gross margin dollar basis, are really attractive. So to your point on tapered gross margin as we look into 2016 is exactly right and that's the way to think about it. Blake, if you want to talk about the SMB macro environment. Blake Irving : James, this is Blake. Our business isn't cyclical but we see pretty meaningful resilience from small businesses. And if you look back in time of the company between 2006 and 2010 had double-digit growth. And it think what it speaks to is that it's not just an established small business. It's people that have new ideas, trying to take that idea online. And frankly, that optimism, that folks rely on themselves. when time get tough, they get a new idea and they are going to do something with it, it usually starts with a name and a digital presence after that and we see pretty resilience market compared to some of the reports on the SMB environment. But it's a positive trend. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Thank you. Blake, just on international. Was the business application uptake, I just wanted to be clear that you are seeing similar uptake that you had seen in international as you are seeing in the U.S.? Or is there any differences as you see the first-time customers coming in as they look at maybe just going with one product or they starting with bundles is similar to what you are seeing in U.S.? Blake Irving : Hi Brent, this is Blake. So look, we see the subscription business, so it starts out with the first purchase and then builds over time. And as we enter a market, we see attach rates that start to model the other countries that we entered into. So as O365 was rolled out, as email applications rolled out, we see those things been attached similar to the markets that are more mature internationally today which start to look a lot like the U.S. over time. So we will see, I think, increasing penetration of O365, as an example. And we offer that, frankly, in every language and markets that we entered next 53 markets and 26 languages. So we expect to see a good penetration there. Brent Thill : Okay. Great. And Scott just on ARPU, you have been running double-digit for last couple of quarters. It's been mid single-digits and I think you have been clear to not expect a double-digit pace. Can you remind us going forward your expectations for ARPU? Is it mid single-digit number? A number that we should think about it for modeling purposes? Blake Irving : Yes. And Brent, ARPU over the last several quarters has been mid single digits. So just the pacing from the fourth quarter has actually been pretty consistent with how we have been running our product and honestly that's the way to think about it going forward too. I think we are running the business with a nice balance between customer adds and ARPU growth and frankly what we have seeing in the fourth quarter is a good way to think about it going forward. Brent Thill : Great. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC. Your line is open. Mark Mahaney : Great. Thanks. I think most of my questions have been asked and I hope this isn't a repeat. Can you comment on the net adds? They came in a little light versus what we expected this quarters? Did those come in largely in line with your expectations? And any color around them with the net adds? Is the source geographically vertically similar to what you have seen in the past? Any trends in terms of retention or in terms of the gross adds, the churn?. Thank you very much. Scott Wagner : Hi Mark, it's Scott. In terms of the quarter on net adds, the total customer won is the right way to think about it, just given the size of the base and the dynamics across markets and the total customer growth was 9%. It's steady as she goes. Frankly, I wouldn't look too much about the immediate quarter-over-quarter like just the translation of both year-over-year and what happens in the market as it might make a quarter-to-quarter comparison a little lumpy. But look, if you take a look at the customer adds, you are looking at million plus net new ads every single year and that's the way to think about the business going forward. And we are positioned in a trajectory to absolutely deliver that. Mark Mahaney : Thank you, Scott. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gene Munster with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Gene Munster : Great. Thanks guys and congrats on a solid quarter. First on GoDaddy Pro. Can you give a quick update on what the progress on that initiative is? And then second, can you talk more broadly about India? How has the investments from VCs and big tech firms impacted the Internet adoption in that country? Thanks. Blake Irving : Sure. Hi Gene, it's Blake. Look, we continue to thousand of pros through that program. A lot of pros are entering the GoDaddy franchises which is great. When you think that 50%of websites are not built by individuals, they are built by professionals for small businesses or large businesses for that matter. We have added the ability for our pros to start including showcase in their portfolio work and previous. We have added the ability for customers to actually find a pro in our system and in our program and I think that we are frankly quite optimistic about it. Half the pros that are entering the program today are coming from outside of United States which is, if you take India as an example, many and most websites of India are developed by a web professional, not by an individual. So we think internationally, the Web Pro program will have a pretty big impact for us. On India, Internet adoption correlates with market growth and we are seeing very fast Internet adoption in India and it's helping fuel the market there. So we are seeing a very nice growth profile there and we see similar things in other countries as they start to model that same type of penetration growth. So it's a positive thing. Gene Munster : Great. Thanks guys. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the company for closing remarks. Blake Irving : Hi. This is Blake everyone. I want to thank all of you for joining us today and most importantly, I want to you take a lesson from Jeb Bush and jebbush.com and go buy your name and own your identity before somebody else does. I think I will end it on a cheery note like that. Anyway, have a good day and we will talk to you next quarter. Bye now. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Good afternoon and thank you all for joining us for GoDaddy's first quarter 2016 earnings call. With me today are Blake Irving, Chief Executive Officer and Scott Wagner, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Blake and Scott have some prepared remarks which we will follow with a Q&A session. On today's call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results, such as total bookings, adjusted EBITDA, un-levered free cash flow, net debt and ARPU.  A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents, may be found in the presentation posted to our investor relations website at investors.godaddy.net or on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC with today's earnings release. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, May 4, 2016 and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. I'll now turn the call over to Blake. Blake Irving : Thanks, Marta and thanks to all of you for joining us today. GoDaddy's first quarter was another good one, with contributions from all of our major product lines driving strong top line growth and cash flow. The strength of our execution and our financial results have remained just as consistent as our commitment to our vision. To radically shift the global economy towards small business by helping individuals easily start, confidently grow and successfully run their own ventures. Millions of global customers use our growing suite of elegant, easy to use and integrated cloud-based products, all built on a single global technology platform and supported by outcome-driven, personalized customer care to create a successful online presence. I would like to share three take-aways from our early 2016 results and longer term road map today. First, our focus on consistent, strong financial performance and growth continues to pay off. Second, following our January launch of localized websites and products in Asia, we continue to feel good about the significant long term growth opportunity in international markets. Third, we're continuing to broaden our company reach with new marketing messages about what we do and who we do it for, delivered through a broader array of marketing tactics and channels on my first point on our business results, Go Daddy's unique combination of great products, fast, reliable and high-performance technology and empathetic customer care continued to differentiate what we do and have together yielded a large, high-growth business with strong cash flow. In the first quarter, we've grown to serve over 14.1 million customers, an increase of over 1 million customers versus a year ago. Our average revenue per user or ARPU, rose over 6% to $123, in spite of currency headwinds. Strong customer and ARPU growth together drove our first quarter revenue up 18% on a constant currency basis or over 15% on a reported basis, to $434 million. First quarter bookings grew 14% on a constant currency basis or 12% reported, to $558 million. Our adjusted EBITDA jumped 23%, to $116 million in the first quarter and we converted 87% of our adjusted EBITDA and un-levered free cash flow, again near the high end of our long term expectations. On my second point about international opportunity, with our January launch in Asia, Go Daddy now offers localized version of our website and software in 53 markets globally, across the Americas, Europe and Asia. Our Asia launch is following our proven international rollout play book. Beginning in January, with the availability of a localized customer experience across our website customer care and our products, followed by the addition of market-specific products such as .cn in China and .jp in Japan. Then further tuning the content, pricing and offers on our local sites. And now we're beginning to ramp digital marketing in the region, with local search engines like Baidu and Naver and consumer focused PR to build brand awareness. We're excited to be in these new markets and believe there's a huge long term opportunity in Asia. That said, we really expect the lion's share of our growth in 2016 to come from our tier 1 markets which are the U.S., Canada, the UK, Australia, India, Brazil and Mexico. Our in-market teams are driving growth for us by bringing local insight to our global platform. Market by market, we have specific initiatives to drive customer growth, ARPU and customer satisfaction, everything from deploying brand campaigns in Australia, to igniting outbound customer care in the UK, to subscription billing in India. We feel good about our proven ability to continue growing our existing international markets with very attractive return characteristics, while at the same time ramping our presence in the new Asian markets. It's worth briefly taking a step back to look at what we've built in international. Over the last three years, we've established a global franchise, with over 4.5 million customers outside of the U.S., more than $400 million in annual revenue, a steady growth profile and an attractive trajectory, yielding a great long term opportunity for GoDaddy. My third point ties directly to what I just shared about our international opportunity. We've recently launched our new marketing strategy and are rolling out our new global brand and ad campaigns now, including rebranded sites around the world. Our new ads are designed to address our new global market, with messaging and imagery focusing on what we do and the customers we do it for. Our 2016 marketing plans include pacing our spending more consistently throughout the year, with a focus on broadening our global reach and building our brand, especially in markets outside of the U.S. This year, we expect to grow our tier 1 markets by focusing on a more consistent presence in TV and radio throughout the year. With expanded use of new tactics for us, complimenting existing digital channels like search and email marketing with more social media, direct response TV and display retargeting so we can maintain a more consistent dialogue with our customers. In North America, we're running an ad campaign that continues the narrative of the small business winning against the odds. No matter how crazy the idea, whether it's creating hats for cats and yes that is a thing or carving heads out of cheese which is amazingly also a thing, we power these ideas with simple, elegant technology. And during the NBA playoffs, even Shaquille O'Neal was getting into the act, with a bust made out of Swiss cheese and a twitter handle to match. His handle is @shaqincheese. And if you're wondering, that is @shaqincheese and no, I'm not kidding. On top of all of our geographic and marketing progress, we have continued to bring a lot of new products and features to market already in 2016. Including a mobile app for domain investors, domain search improvements, new themes for website builder, an integration between our website builder and SCO tools, an expanded WordPress offering, new email marketing, an online store features, Office 365 encryption and archiving and an integration of GoDaddy domains and SSL with Microsoft Azure. In short, it's been a very busy quarter for product introductions and enhancements. And this quarter's launch cycle also brought a great example of the power of our platform in action. We launched our new cloud server and cloud applications offerings simultaneously, across 26 languages and 53 markets. All of our markets, at exactly the same time, something we believe no one else in our space has the capability to do. As we continue to improve the user experience and features in our existing products, we also know our small business customers have other needs that are not being addressed. And we know that with the right combination of technology and care, we can solve their problems, help them acquire and retain customers and help them look more professional while saving them money. Our platform was architected to make it easy to bring new offerings online and integrate them with existing products quickly. All in all, we feel really good about the quarter, our progress so far this year and our future road map. So now, I'm going to turn it over to Scott for the financials. Scott Wagner : Thanks, Blake. There's three key financial points I would like to cover with everyone today. First, as Blake said, we continue to deliver strong, consistent revenue growth, with a nice balance between customer and ARPU increases. Second, we continue to deliver gains and both of our key profitability metrics, adjusted EBITDA and un-levered free cash flow and third, we continue to deliver solid growth at scale. On my first point, our revenue grew approximately 18% on a constant currency basis in Q1 or 15% on a reported basis. Looking at our two revenue drivers, customers grew nearly 8% over the last year, to 14.1 million and ARPU grew over 6%, to $123, even while absorbing the impact of the stronger dollar. Our total bookings grew 14% in constant currency or 12% reported. I'd like to touch on bookings and the relationship to revenue for a second. There are several things that we're doing that happened to impact quarterly bookings and we're managing them very deliberately, with a focus on driving revenue and customer lifetime value. First, we're shortening our average contract length, intentionally reducing some of our multi-year discounts. Second, we're offering free trials of our high-value products, like Office 365 and our website builder product. And third, we're spreading more of our advertising in outbound customer marketing efforts, to our customer audience throughout the year, relative to historically heavier Q1 past efforts. Now, these are all good for the business, because we know what customers try and use our products, they stay with us for a long time and they spend more with us over time which leads to my second point which is we're consistently delivering even faster growth on the bottom line. Adjusted EBITDA grew over 23% year over year and un-levered free cash flow rose 18% on the heels of 71% year-over-year growth in the year-ago quarter. These are solid gains in our two key profitability measures, achieved while we continued to invest in growth. On my third point, on growth at scale, we're continuing to see good top line and margin gains from our multi-year investments in both product and platform. We're seeing nice margin leverage through our operating expenses, even as we invest in new product categories and geographic markets. And looking ahead, we see good opportunity to continue to expand both our product portfolio and to build our global footprint at attractive economics. I'll provide some brief color on the performance of our three product lines. First, domains revenue finished the quarter at $219 million, up nearly 10% year over year. Our domains business continues to be fueled by international growth, strong renewals and continued expansion at domains after-market. Our hosting and presence revenue was $160 million in Q1, up more than 14% year over year. We're seeing nice gains in hosting and presence from our DIY presence products, as well as valuable add-ons like search engine visibility, paid backup and malware scans, all of which we're increasingly merchandising with and in our presence applications themselves. We will continue to experiment with both merchandising and bundling tactics both within and across our product lines to drive attachment, activation and usage of our offering. Business applications revenue of $54 million grew over 47% year over year in Q1, driven by continued strong growth in both productivity and email marketing. Our quarterly revenue from business applications is more than 3 times what it was three years ago, demonstrating the power of our platform and business model to extend beyond domains, hosting and presence. Turning quickly to international, our revenue outside the U.S. now represents 26% of our total revenue and grew 25% on a constant currency basis in Q1, versus the nearly 17% reported growth. As Blake said, while we're excited to have added Asia to the fold this year, we're focusing in particular in 2016 on expanding in key tier 1 markets, including Canada, the UK, Australia, India, Brazil and Mexico.  Turning to profitability, we continue to deliver strong cash flow. I mentioned adjusted EBITDA grew over 23% in Q1, to $116 million, producing a 26.7% margin, a gain of 170 basis points versus prior year. Un-levered free cash flow was up 18% in the quarter, to $101 million. In Q1, we converted 87% of adjusted EBITDA into un-levered free cash flow, again near the high end of our long term target range of 70% to 90%. And overall, our combination of strong top and bottom-line performance continues to demonstrate the inherent leverage in our operating model, allowing us to steadily grow revenue, invest in growth across the business and deliver excellent un-levered free cash flow. We finished Q1 with approximately $440 million in cash and short term investments and net debt of $641 million or about 1.8 times our adjusted EBITDA for trailing 12 months. We remain focused on utilizing our balance sheet to help expand our product portfolio and global customer base over time. However, given the solid organic growth of our core business, we have been and intend to remain selective about our acquisitions. So let's discuss our outlook for Q2 and the full year 2016. For Q2, we expect revenue in the range of $448 million to $452 million and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $99 million to $102 million. For the full year 2016, we're raising the midpoint of our revenue range which is now $1.83 billion to $1.845 billion, implying 14% growth at the midpoint of that range, in line with long term targets that we've shared with everyone. We're also raising our full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance, to $404 million to $414 million. The midpoint our new range implies 21% growth year over year, also in line with our long term targets. So overall, we remain focused on delivering our continued growth at scale. Our combination of a huge addressable global market and Go Daddy's distinctive products, technology and care translate into a proven financial model with consistent overall revenue and cash flow growth. So thanks, everyone, for joining and we're ready to open up the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Your line is open. Ron Josey : Two, please. Real quick, Blake, you talked almost most of the growth in 216 coming from tier 1 markets. And now, with a good amount of international users, I think 4.5 million, when do you think non-tier 1 markets can be impactful to overall growth? Knowing, of course, that Asia just launched, but just trying to understand the cadence of how that goes over time. And then with the new approach to marketing being more of a consistent, always on message throughout the year, how does this impact how you feel you're adding net customer adds throughout the year? Maybe 1Q a little bit different, simply because you weren't on the Super Bowl and how you think that goes through the rest of the year? Thank you. Blake Irving : As you said, we grew 4.5 million international customers no. With tier 2, it certainly is contributing. We spend the bulk of our marketing dollars at the top of funnel which is radio and TV in tier 1 markets and really spend, I would say on search, primarily SEM, in tier 2 markets. And we're seeing contribution there. Asia today and you mentioned Asia specifically, is really only 4% of our overall business today, so it's a pretty small part of our business. Yet we know that we're feeling good about the launch. We've seen increased activity there and think longer term, it provides a great opportunity for us. I think we're going to be focused on making the markets that we have out and deployed and are more effective with, again, SEM purchase and activity in tier 2. And doing top of funnel, both radio, TV, did search and display retargeting in tier 1 and going pretty deep there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Sterling Auty : You talked about intentionally shortening duration. Curious, is that shortening duration across all three segments, so domains as well as any bundled hosting and applications? And why do you feel it actually improves the health or the long term value of the customer? Scott Wagner : First, let's call it shortening term is showing up in hosting and presence and productivity on a relative basis. So the impact is mostly in those areas. And first of all, there is both a shortened term or you reduce long term discounting, to have people sign up for a 3 or 5 year term. But we know that when customers use these products, after the first year, that the product renewal rates are terrific, right? And so you're getting annual renewal rates that are showing up, on an in-period or year-over-year expense, a higher dollar value, right? Because you're not bringing forward five years' worth of billings, but at a discount. And our focus, again, is around getting people to try and use more of our products, right? Because again, we know that when they do, the renewal rates are great and that helps build the franchise over time. We're basically not leaving dollars on the table by discounting for those significantly multi-year terms. Does that make sense? Sterling Auty : It does and then one follow-up. Can you give us some color? You've had some success over the last couple of quarters, I believe, in some of the bundling of the business applications with the hosting. What are you seeing in that program? And what is that driving more of? Is it driving more hosted email, Office 365 or something else? Blake Irving : I think we're seeing really nice attachment and usage in productivity, right? And that's Office 365 across the various plans. And we're encouraged by those results. And obviously, if you're looking at the aggregate revenue of that segment, we're continuing to put up big numbers. So you can say that some of the merchandising tactics continue to pay off there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Jason Helfstein : Two questions. First, can you talk about your learning since the launch of the collateral offering? What type of demand you are seeing and how do you think about the value proposition versus, let's say, Dropbox or a box that some of your customers might be using? And can you talk about why you're not worried about Google, Amazon, Microsoft moving into your vertical with their offering? And then secondly and I've asked this in the past, but you generated another $92 million of free cash flow after interest in the quarter. It doesn't really make sense to pay down debt, given the predictability of the business. What are you going to do with the cash? Thanks. Blake Irving : Two distinctly different questions. So I'll hit the first one and then I'll hand it over to Scott on the what are you doing with the cash side. We're super early, as you know, with this cloud-based product. It is a new product for us. We have had it out roughly a month. We saw a very good, successful pickup with it initially. But frankly, it's just too early to say what the overall impact is going to be. The customer for our cloud offering is quite different than -- but whether Amazon, Microsoft or Google. Amazon, Microsoft and Google are all going after very large enterprise workloads. And frankly, we service a smaller developer who is building out capability for small businesses and we tend to see usage that isn't as expansive as an enterprise, but more targeted to the customer that we've been serving. Microsoft's partnered with us, actually, on their Azure platform, to offer both our domains and our SSL to target these larger enterprises which -- it's not our wheelhouse and it's not who we serve today. We service that developer who builds products for either a small business, a midsize business and that's what we built that cloud offering for. It's a super easy to use set of applications that you can instantly build on top of a cloud and build resources out as you go. And let me hand it over to Scott on the cash use question. Scott Wagner : So let me start by, again, just describing how we think about the business today and then our opportunities for growth. Which is, we're serving a customer segment and audience that our customers stay with us for a long time. 7 years plus, on average, with those who are engaged even staying longer. And a service and business model that grows with our customers over time. I think we've proven over the last 2 to 2 1/2 years that we can expand our product portfolio and our geographic footprint productively. Particularly organically, plus with a couple of very small product-related acquisitions that we've done to really just plug in something like email marketing into our portfolio, at attractive unit economics overall. So it's a really nice position to be and obviously we're looking at different product categories that fit the bill for our customers, where we think we can add distinctive value with a combination of integrating it with the products we have and delivering the service in the manner in which we deliver it and we think there's really nice opportunities for us to continue to expand the product portfolio. And as we've built that out obviously, then you can turn towards geographies, as well and think about how and where we overlay our now increasingly robust product portfolio and go to market into geographies. So that's how we think about it. And there are certainly opportunities for us to do it, but we're going to be pretty thoughtful and economic about if and how and stay tuned. And this will probably be -- I'm sure as we nicely continue to generate cash, this will be questions that everyone will continue to ask. We're going to think about using this, how to grow the franchise for the long term productively and distinctively. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gene Munster with Piper. Your line is open. Gene Munster : Couple things. First, in terms of the duration of the contract, because you've been tightening that up. I think, Blake, you had mentioned that you have high customer retention, but have you actually -- since it's a relatively new phenomenon of you tightening those up, if I'm not mistaken, is there data to suggest that this will in fact not lead to higher churn? And then separately, you talked about some of the new tactics, such as with the cats and the hats and the cheese theme. And have you been bucket testing some of these new tactics? Or can you just walk through how you see this playing out, in terms of the impact to revenue growth? Thanks. Scott Wagner : So the first one around, how do we think about renewal, are we testing the impact of it? And the answer is, yes. We're looking at the behavior of every single customer cohort around not only when they start with us in month 1, but then month 13 and beyond and as we experiment with these tactics, we're watching it, right? And we're watching it and things that are working and where we're seeing good indications across the cohort, we're going to do more of it. So generally, again, thematically, when customers activate and use our stuff, they are staying with us and they're buying more. And so at a theme level, if that is a true statement and it has been for long time and our various tactics are just ways to introduce products in a good way to our customers. Blake Irving : So just building on top of that, but the churn level of the business has been extremely low. Our retention of customers is at 85% plus. So we continue to maintain that impressive retention level. And then just a quick comment on both the cats and hats trade of execution and the cheese head execution, as well. Look, we have been bucket testing. We certainly continue to bucket test those offers and have been pulsing that across all media types, whether it's digital -- you've certainly probably heard it on the radio and seen it on the top of funnel on TV, as well. We continue to pulse and spend frankly more on social mid-funnel stuff like re-targeted, I will call it re-targeted display and email marketing and we're hitting every one of those channels with the same messages in the U.S. Outside of the U.S., we've introduced and you probably haven't seen this -- but if you go through some of the other languages or other country websites, you will see a thematic about customers of ours that talk about what they do, what we provide for them and what they do with the tools and the products we give them. And you can actually go to the website and pop into different countries and see the thematics playing out across the global. Very uniform in our messaging, very uniform in our approach. And we get some good operating leverage out of providing that same creative across the world, but the U.S. is a rather unique market for us. We've been here quite a long time and have used humor for a heck of a long time and continue to do that. And it resonates with our audience here in the United States. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Mark Mahaney : Scott, I missed something. You talked about three steps that you were undertaking, shortening of the average contract length, spreading the marketing throughout the year and there was a third one. Could you just repeat that? And then on spreading the marketing throughout the year, I think you were asked this earlier, but I want to ask again. What's the why behind that? Why spread marketing more evenly throughout the year? Was there a learning recently that made you think that would be more optimal? Thanks a lot. Scott Wagner : Yes, Mark. It's more touches. So historically, our marketing spend, obviously weighted heavy up towards the first quarter of the year. And we really didn't have a lot of, call it reach frequency touches around our customer base. And now, as we're spreading things consistently throughout the year, it is allowing us to frankly reach, touch our customers in a more consistent way through different venues. And if you think about, again, GoDaddy, what makes us special, the mix of the products that we have and the great way we deliver it, again, it's about exposing customers to that value proposition. And frankly, we're looking for more not only medium but times that we can do it. And we think it's just the next way that the marketing matches the size of the franchise and frankly the opportunities for us and our customers. And then on your first question, the other tactic is free trial of high-value products like Office 365 and website builder. So you'll notice that particularly at Office 365 will offer first month free trial, again for that service and increasingly our website builder. And we're finding really good activation with that starting point. And again, on the back end of that month's free trial, the conversion in dollars, but to be clear, that's a free trial. We're bringing people into these products, allowing them to use and try to them because again, we know when people try them, they stay and then they tend to spend more over time. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Deepak Mathivanan : Two questions. First, wanted to ask about the website builder and business apps products. Can you perhaps qualitatively discuss about where we're with respect to the penetration rates for these in your customer base? And then also, how did the mix look like between these products into your new customer base? And I have a follow-up for Scott. Scott Wagner : So on business applications, we've shared that we're over 2 million paid customers into the franchise, out of our 14 million base. And so that's, again, our installed base. So business apps were 2 million of 14 million. If we're looking at our new cohorts, our percentage of users of business applications is quite a bit higher than that. We're not going to share the exact numbers, let's just call it quite a bit higher, qualitatively. On presence, across the hosting and presence segment, the number is 5 million, so 5 million of the 14 million. And again, if you're thinking about the percentage of new cohorts that are using those products, again, it is higher than that percentage, as well. Not as dramatically as Biz Apps, but it's higher. Deepak Mathivanan : And then Scott, one other thing. In the past few quarters, you saw some significant hit to bookings from FX. Does your revenue guidance for the full year and also for second quarter, currently reflect the flow-through impact from that? Or do you expect meaningful effects headwinds to continue on revenues? Scott Wagner : No, thanks, our guidance incorporates the impact of FX on bookings. So thanks for the question, Deepak. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of James Cakmak with Monness, Crespi & Hardt. Your line is open. James Cakmak : Just to go back on the contract duration, not to beat a dead horse. Can you just talk about the average contract length that you're targeting. Is this trying to go from like 5 years down to 2 years? Or I guess what is the magnitude of the narrowing of the contract life? And then Blake, on the leadership bench, you had some churn at the CTO level. Can you just talk about the team you have in place? And I guess how you're thinking about the replacements there and confidence in the team in general? Scott Wagner : The average term length of a product is a shade over a year, a shade meaning, call it, 16 months-ish. And so we're not doing wholesale dramatic changes. But what we're doing is taking a relatively small amount of customer behavior which had big, multi-year term discounts and trimming those back a little bit. And so what you have is that length moving in by, you might call it an average week and it's not a dramatic change in practices; it's just good operational tightening. And then the other thing I would say to that same point is, the higher value services that we have, like Office 365 and some of the more advanced hosting services, we pretty much sell them on a year. And so as those products grow as a percentage of our mix and growth, just by basic mix math, your term length is moving in a little. Not for anything that we're even consciously doing, it's just the growth in these higher value services. But again, it's important to note that the product renewal rates are as good, if not even better, than they've ever been. So this is just good business for us. Blake Irving : James, this is Blake, answering the second part of your question. So we had a CTO change, as you pointed out. I'll tell you, I feel very, very good about the bench strength of the leadership team across the company. We had a very capable technical staff here and actually had hired, two years ago, Arne Josefsberg, who was the Chief Technical Officer at Service Now, to be our CIO. So we have an incredibly strong and very experienced leader who took the reins of CTO and CIO and he has built a huge platform, at scale, actually built along the Azure platform at Microsoft, as well, has built and assembled a great team. So across both the technical side of the business, we've got a very strong team. The double leads that are on that team and honestly across the company on every product group, are rocking and rolling and I would put them up against any team in the industry, frankly, today. And I'll just say this. When you have really great people and this happens to every company -- you are going to be pursued by companies like Google and others of that category and class. And so I think it's a good testament to the quality of the people we have on the team that frankly, after 3 years and getting a whole lot of work done, our CTO took a role, it's a pretty important role -- after building out a really nice platform that we're using across the company and it's helping us scale. And we still have a ton of folks that are great at it and are still hiring a ton of folks that are great at it. So we're pretty stoked about the quality of our senior leadership team and down through the ranks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. Your line is open. Mark May : I guess on the non-domain services, I wonder if you could comment bit on what you've been seeing recently, both in the quarter, but over the last 6 to 12 months or so, in terms of attach rates from a domain to one or more of your non-domain services? And then on a related point, anything from a product and/or merchandising standpoint that could meaningfully change the mix of the non-domain revenue over the next year that we should be thinking about? And I had a follow-up. Scott Wagner : So on the non-domain products in attach, I think similar to the color from Deepak's question, we're seeing a nice attachment on our anchor products. Anchor products meaning website builder, shared hosting and particularly O-365 and look, O-365 is the big star around that which is -- and showing up in the revenue growth rate. So our attachment and success with that attachment continues to show up in, frankly, what's a very high revenue growth rate on what's become a pretty sizable business. And I think that it leads into your next question of boy, are there some things on product and merchandising that might alter the mix? We're hoping that we see continued growth, right? We have got continued growth in the Biz Apps category, its productivity plus email marketing. And there are a couple other, I think, areas and categories that we think we can move into and develop franchises that are going to continue to add more legs to the product stool. So we're excited about that and excited about what it means for the long term. And this is on a pretty big base of revenue already, right, where our non-domain business is already 2 times the rate of domain growth. And we're going to continue to build out everything in that stable. Mark May : And if I could ask a follow-up, all of the OpEx lines showed pretty meaningful leverage in the quarter. But gross margin expanded year on year, but maybe at a little bit slower rate than what we've seen in the last few quarters. Is there anything that influenced that? I don't know if it was FX or mix or maybe margins at the segment level changed a bit on one or two products? Can you call out anything there in particular? Scott Wagner : Sure. So the margin profile of the non-domain products continues to be really attractive. And as we're lapping really big growth and particularly productivity and we're again bundling that service in, we're frankly intentionally -- it's not necessarily holding our gross margin percentages. But the impact of both some of the lapping of our growth of O-365, plus some of our merchandising tactics, is flattening out that gross margin percentage line. Now as you point out, we're getting really nice leverage through our operating expenses and that balance is intentional. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Brian Essex : I was wondering if I could and I apologize if I missed it. But in the cloud server and cloud apps products that you rolled out, can you offer maybe a little bit of color behind the catalyst? As well as what you expect the penetration to be and contribution to the platform along the recent comments that you're making with regard to margins? How profitable, how meaningful will that business be? Blake Irving : It's early days. So over time, we think there's going to be meaning behind the product. I would say the catalyst behind the product and the reason for building it, is that it is clear that there are a variety of applications that our developer community likes to use and they'd like to be able to spin up an instance of that very, very quickly. So we provided a situation and application suite that allows them to spin up, whether it's a Joomla, Drupal, Ruby, WordPress instance, very, very quickly and simply, on top of OpenStack that allows them to also expand the number of instances they've got as their customers grow. And frankly, it's something that competitively we did not have. We weren't in market with it before. And so getting that launched and getting it into the marketplace and launching it globally and just to be really clear, when we launched this product, we launched it in 53 markets, in 26 languages and 44 currencies, all on the same day and nobody's done that before. And our developers, in fact I would say more than half of our developers on our pro platform, they are coming in from outside of the country. So there's actually meaning for us to provide this capability in multiple languages, making it accessible to developers all over the world. And we think that that hypothesis will prove out to be a builder of revenue and attach for developers across the globe. Scott Wagner : Yes, if I could, for one second. I think the value for this product is really a line towards these web pros that are pros particularly overseas. And again, this isn't the hard-core developers who are muscling up on AWS, it's allowing this infrastructure for this audience. And look, it's early days. It's early days and we will see what the ramp is. But we think the marginal economics and the market opportunity is one that we can plan and it's early and we'll see how goes. Blake Irving : And also, Scott and I are [indiscernible] a little bit. But I think the other thing to note is, we built this on top of an OpenStack platform. So the leverage and the operating leverage we're getting out of that OpenStack platform, is allowing us to build product suites on top of it, on top of common infrastructure, globally. So that is a very important thing to note across everything that we're doing. So this is a segment built on top of a platform that we're going to be taking everywhere. Brian Essex : And if I could just follow up on progress with Asia, I understand you're focused on tier 1 markets, going forward. But any updates on Asia and how that's going? And have you learned anything since you started penetrating? Any changes to your strategy in that market? Blake Irving : Look, I wouldn't say that there's any change in strategy. We're going to be very consistent with the way we roll Asia out. Consistent with the way we rolled out Europe, consistent with the way that we rolled out Latin America. Which was, as I described, get the language in, get some products that are specific to those markets and then once you've done that, then start tuning the site and then start doing marketing spend. The market reacted quite positively to the launch and our PR and we saw an immediate uplift, but I'll tell you, look, it's still super early. We're early days there and I did learn something anecdotally that was quite surprising to me from -- I was personally out there launching those markets. And it turns out that GoDaddy is a brand that is quite well known both in Asia and India and anywhere that developers have been educated in the United States and receive their computer science degree, whether undergrad or Masters or PhD. So we found multiple folks that told us, we know who you are, we're quite familiar with your brand, we just didn't know you were here. So when we show up in market, one of the reasons we've seen our brand-aided awareness in India move from the teens to almost 80 in the last 3 1/2 years is because we were known when we entered. And we just let people know we were there in their language and in their market, in their currency and we were easier to do business with. And we expect to see similar results in Asia that we've seen in our other markets. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with UBS. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Scott, on the EBITDA margin side at 27%, that's the best we've seen. Can you talk about some of the drivers there? And you're guiding for 22% annually, so you're expecting, obviously, a slowdown through the year. Why would you see that slowdown after what you just showed in the current quarter? Scott Wagner : Yes Brent, if you back up the quarters, Q1 is always the highest margin. And that's just about the pacing of how, really, the top line is flowing in. And so Q1 is always our highest margin quarter. And so if you're looking at just the operating leverage, though, you are seeing really nice year-over-year leverage from our tech and dev, particularly infrastructure at G&A and even some on care which is nice. And so that operating leverage, we think, across those expense lines are going to continue to flow through the rest of the year which is going to drive continued really nice growth in adjusted EBITDA. Brent Thill : Okay. And real quickly on the ARPU, 6% growth the last three quarters. I know you're not guiding to that metric, but it seems like there's a considerable opportunity with the layered stack, if you will, of the applications that you can put in relative to what you're doing right now. Can you just walk through what you think could be the biggest driver, here in the back half of the year, for you on ARPU? Blake Irving : Yes, Brent, we're just layering on a big, big base. And so you are seeing hosting and presence and business applications just continue to grow very nicely and those will continue to be the drivers of ARPU growth. But again, if we're looking forward a quarter or two, we're just doing this on top of such a monstrous base that you're not going to see dramatic changes in that number. And I would point out, again that the FX impact that is hitting us now and will continue to flow through the next couple of quarters, that shows up at ARPU, right? All ARPU. So these ARPU gains are absorbing that FX hit that's going to continue for the next couple quarters. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sameet Sinha with B. Riley. Please go ahead. Sameet Sinha : Scott, you touched on it earlier, but the shortening contract length and I'm just trying to figure out what would be the impact on deferred revenues? And I know you mentioned it's going to bring it down by a week or so, but how should we think about it over the next couple of years? And secondly, in terms of the international markets, what is the messaging that you're using there? Is it more direct response messaging, branding? Can you elaborate on that? Thank you. Scott Wagner : Yes, so first on the deferred, you can actually see the contribution to deferred, certainly, in the adjusted EBITDA reconciliation. And it's a bit more than a week. Now going forward, again our tactics are tactics designed around maximizing revenue and lifetime value. So we'll be clear about what we're doing with everybody, but we're not intentionally trying to land at some number or term length. And then on number two, on international messaging, Blake, you want to take that? Blake Irving : Yes, so on international messaging, I'm not exactly sure which direction your question is going. Messaging that we're bringing into market is consistent and it is targeted at small business person who is fighting the good fight and frankly in different creative, but very, very similar thematics. And then your question actually talked about, I think, what type of marketing. And in tier 1 markets, we're doing, I will call it broad-based top of funnel advertising, both in TV and radio, all the way down to direct and search and display retargeting. In tier 2 markets, we tend to go direct. We spent most of our lion's share of spend in tier 2 is on search and there's some display retargeting, but it's primarily digital. Yet the themes that we're using for messaging are the same. So no big brand spend in tier 2 markets. A benefit, as I described earlier, by having significantly bleed-through from tier 1 markets into second-tier markets, the brand spend that we do make in tier 1 markets does benefit us in tier 2, as well. Yet the spend that we actually do in those tier 2 markets is direct. Does that answer the question, Suneet? Operator : There are no further questions. At this time, I turn the call back to the presenters for closing remarks. Blake Irving : Hey everybody, thanks for staying with us for our Q1 earnings and we look forward to talking with you in one more quarter. Thanks, everyone. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

I'll now turn the call over to Blake. Blake Irving : Thanks, Marta and thanks to all of you for joining us today. GoDaddy's second quarter was a very good one. Both our revenue and adjusted EBITDA exceeded the top end of our range as we shared with you last quarter. GoDaddy's unique combination of great products, fast reliable and high performance technology and empathetic customer care continue to differentiate what we do and have together yielded a large high growth business with strong cash flow.  In the second quarter we have grown to serve over 14.3 million customers, an increase of more than 1 million versus a year ago. Our average revenue per user or ARPU rose 6% to $125, despite currency headwinds. Strong customer and ARPU together drove an acceleration in our top line this quarter. Our second quarter revenue grew 18% on a constant currency basis or 16% on a reported basis to $456 million, and Q2 bookings grew 14% on a constant currency basis, or 13% reported to $539 million. Our adjusted EBITDA jumped 26% to $104 million in the second quarter and we generated strong unlevered free cash flow of $84 million. We feel about these results and what they say about the strength of our strategy and execution over the last several years, and more importantly where we're headed. In fact, several of us approached our three-year anniversary at GoDaddy this year and we took a step back to review of execution against the vision and long-term strategy we laid out when I joined the Company. Our strategy has gotten us to much more meaningful scale, doubling the size of the business over the last four years on both the top and bottom lines, and we're now building on the foundation we've created with an eye towards doubling the business again over the next four years. I want to touch on our key accomplishments over the last three years and then tell you how we'll be expanding on what we've done in 2016 and in the future. Simply put, the last three years were about first building the product portfolio, second expanding internationally, third evolving our brand, and fourth, proving the strength and consistency of the business model. Let me expand on each of those. First on products. We've executed well on our product portfolio, enhancing our capabilities, primarily in preexisting categories including domains, hosting, web presence, security, email and email marketing by making our product set deeper, broader and faster as well as more user friendly performance reliable and more mobile. We've also expanded into new categories to serve more of our customers needs and integrated our products to make them more valuable together than they were individually. You've seen us introduce new offerings like Managed WordPress, Email Marketing, Cloud Servers, Web Pro Tools, Office 365 for Microsoft, SiteLock and soon we'll add Telephony with our pending acquisition of FreedomVoice. And we've been shifting our merchandising to bring our products together in bundles and allow better in application product up sells, like backup and security products for our hosting customers and email marketing, integrated with a website builder product. The product and platform teams have seriously been cranking. Second on international, our engineering and product teams have deployed Go Daddy in all major international markets around the world. We now offer our products and services in 29 languages and 56 markets globally, including local language sites and software, local currency and payment types, local imaginary, local phone numbers for customer care and live local language support in Europe, Asia, India and the U.S. We now have over 4.5 million international customers and generate more than a quarter of our revenue outside the U.S. With our global product and service rollout largely complete, we've evolved our focus from introducing more new markets to establishing a larger footprint and lifting growth in the many markets we've now entered. We have concentrated our efforts here by introducing a new marketing and sales organization dedicated to international. Take it as an evolution from getting Go Daddy into every market that matters to now focusing on growing and winning in our priority markets. Third on brand, as we've expanded our product portfolio and our global reach, we've simultaneously and deliberately shifted the Go Daddy brand strategy from one focus to almost totaling on generating awareness to highlighting our small business customers and their experience, making it much clear what we do at Go Daddy and who we do it for. We've made meaningful progress, meaning moving from U.S. centric brand awareness to connecting our brand to positive product experience, and broadening our marketing reach around the world. We're now concentrating our efforts on top of funnel marketing and conversion in our priority markets globally. And first on our business model, following the IPO, we've consistently demonstrated our ability to generate growth of scale, significant free cash flow and business model consistency with five straight quarters at or above our guidance. Look, in short, we've built an engine that has demonstrated real success and we continue to tune and improve our ability to go after a large tam of small and evolving businesses and the go getters to stardom. Now this year we've made a very deliberate move in our products platform and marketing organizations to put proven leaders in place for the next phase of our growth, building on our already solid foundation. Today we're doing the same for our operations channels and marketing as well as our finance organization. To that end, we would be separating the Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer roles. I'm pleased to announce that Scott Wagner is being promoted to President and Chief Operating Officer where he will lead the Company's operations, channels and markets globally. I want to personally thank Scott for carrying the double load of both the COO and CFO roles for the last several years. He has done a killer establishing our financial function as a public Company and has set us on a great path for the future, all while all also running our Company's operations. Thanks a ton, Scott. I'm also pleased to introduce you all to Ray Winborne, who's joining GoDaddy as our Chief Financial Officer. Ray has great experience in finance leadership roles for global scale businesses, serving as CFO for First Data Corporation and Controller at Delta Air Lines and AT&T. Ray's technical and operational capability is proven and his leadership has made those on his teams and everyone to around him just better. I'm excited to have Ray join our team at GoDaddy. I know you are going to get some know him very well. While Ray won't be speaking to the second quarter on this call, I would like to introduce him. Ray? Ray Winborne : Thanks Blake and hello to all of you. I'm thrilled to be joining such as great company and a really top notch team here. And deciding to join GoDaddy, I've been really impressed with the caliber and the depth of the technical and business talent we have throughout this Company. GoDaddy has clearly developed a great business and it was easy to get excited about the purpose here, which is helping small businesses be successful, and also about the massive global opportunity. But honestly it was the culture that brought me here. You can really see the spirit of GoDaddy's small business customers in everything we do. We're entrepreneurial, fast moving and intensely focused on customer service. The energy and the passion here is fantastic.  So some quick background, as Blake said, I'm long time finance guy and I've spend my career with several large global subscription based businesses. Scott and I worked closely together when he was at KKR and I was at First Data. So we've got a lot of shared history and personal and professional respect for each other. I'm really looking forward to digging in here and helping go GoDaddy double in size yet again over the next four years. I'll keep it brief today, but I couldn\u2019t be more excited to be here and look forward to spending more time with our investors and analysts over the coming weeks. With that quick intro, I'll turn it back over to Blake. Blake Irving : Thanks, Ray. We're super happy to hand you. The story I've shared with you all today is -- look, it happened. I just went into that accent. The story I've shared with you all today is one of strong execution over the past three years and continuous improvement on our strategy. We feel really good about the quarter, our continued progress and how our organization is now positioned to take us into the next phase of our growth. With that we'll turn it over to Scott for the financials. Scott Wagner : Thanks, Blake. Let me add my warm welcome to Ray, who I'm thrilled to have in the team. Ray is a terrific executive, a great person who is going to add a ton of value to Go Daddy. Turning back to our results, Q2 was strong on all fronts. Both revenue and adjusted EBITDA came in above the high end of our guidance range with the acceleration in year-over-year growth. In Q2, our revenue grew approximately 18% on a constant currency basis, 16% on a reported to $456 million. We continue to see a nice balance between customer and ARPU increases with customers growing nearly 8% over the last year, $14.3 million and ARPU up over 6% to $125, even while absorbing the impact of the strong dollar. Total bookings grew 14% in constant currency or 13% reported. When we spoke to everyone after the first quarter, we discussed business trends and specific merchandising tactics to drive customer lifetime value and annualized revenue, and noted that some of these may impact bookings and revenue differently. These tactics continued in Q2, including, one, the ongoing mix shift in non-domain products, two, the rollout of free trial of our high value products like Office 365 and our DIY website builder, and three, reductions in multiyear discounts. These actions continue to show promise in terms of customer metrics, and you can see the positive impact in our strong top line performance and raised guidance. We'll focus on driving activation and usage of our anchor products because we know that when our customers try and use our products, they stay for long time and they spend more with us. Turning to our revenue lines, we saw a nice growth across all three of our product lines in the quarter. Domains revenue finished the quarter at $230 million up over 10% year-over-year. This above market performance continued to be fueled by international growth, strong renewals and expansion in the domains our aftermarket. Hosting and presence revenue was $168 million in the quarter, up more than 15% year-over-year. As mentioned, we've been experimenting with 30-day free trial of our website builder product and based on positive results, we're rolling this out across the Go Daddy geographies in Q3. Business applications revenue grew 45% year-over-year in Q2 to $59 million, driven by continued strong growth in both productivity and email marketing. Turning to International, our revenue outside the U.S. now represents 26% of total revenue, and grew 25% on a constant currency basis in Q2 versus reported growth of over 17%. We believe international will continue to be a strong growth driver in the years to come, given the horizontal need for our products and the strength of the Go Daddy brand and value proposition. Turing to profitability, we continue to deliver strong cash flow. Adjusted EBITDA grew 26% in Q2 to $104 million, also above the high end of guidance and producing a 22.7% margin, up a 180 basis points versus prior year. Levered free cash flow is up 9% in Q2 to $84 million. In Q2, we converted 81% of the adjusted EBITDA into free cash, in line with our long-term target range of 70% to 90%. As we've said in the past, on a quarterly basis, cash can be lumpy. With our first tax related payments beginning this year, we were in the middle of our target range for the quarter. For the full year 2016, we still expect a levered free cash flow to grow over 20% versus 2015. We finished Q2 with approximately $482 million in cash and short term investments, and net debt of $596 million, or about 1.6 times our adjusted EBITDA for the last 12 months. As everyone saw with our announcement of FreedomVoice, we're continuing to utilize the balance sheet to help expand our product portfolio and geographic footprint over time and generate long-term shareholder value. So let's discuss our outlook for Q3 and for the full year 2016. For Q3, we expect revenue in the range of $468 million to $471 million, and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $102 million to $105 million. For the full year 2016, we're raising our revenue range again, which is now $1.84 billion to $1.847 billion, implying approximately 14.5% growth at the midpoint, in line with the long term targets we've shared. We're also raising our full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance again to $410 million to $416 million. The midpoint our new range implies 22% growth year-over-year, also in line with our long term targets. Our third quarter and full year revenue guidance incorporate the expected impact of past currency movements. Switching gears for just a sec, the SEC has recently issues interpretations in the use of non-GAAP reporting and guidance measures. GoDaddy has historically guided during reported on a GAAP measure revenue and non-GAAP measure adjusted EBITDA. Our Board of Directors, management team and creditors rely on several GAAP and non-GAAP measures, including revenue and adjusted EBITDA to assess the operating and financial health of our business. As our proxy notes, our management teams compensated on the achievement of several target metrics including adjusted EBITDA and the investment community uses that measure along with other measures of cash flow to value the Company.  At the same time, we're very committed to ensuring compliance with all the SEC's interpretations on non-GAAP measures. So in addition to the reconciliations we've always provided, we provided a new tables today that present the most significant components of our historical adjusted EBITDA measure, which are EBITDA excluding equity base compensation and changes in differed revenue and registry fees. Essentially, the main difference is we're moving acquisition and sponsor related costs which have been less than $1 million per quarter over the past four quarters following our IPO. We expect that any future presentations of the components of EBITDA will no longer adjust for these typically smallest acquisition and sponsor related costs. And following today's call we intend to gather feedback on this presentation of the major components of our historical adjusted EBITDA measure to help in former future presentation.  Now getting back to our business. Q2 was a very strong one. We\u2019re proud of our consistent delivery and our strategy and strong financial results. We will remain focused on delivering continued revenue and cash flow growth as we keep building and scaling our business this year and beyond.  Thanks. And with that we're going to open up the line for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Mark Mahaney : Two questions please. One, any color on specific international markets that drove that 25% year-over-year growth and within that into what extent Asia is building out? In line with plans, ahead of plans, behind plans. And secondly small question on the gross margins. It looks like \u2013 should we assume that going forward you kind of reach the level and this is a kind of a flat lining level. Or are there any major drivers that remain to cause gross margins to continue to expand in the future? Thank you. Blake Irving : Hi, Mark. This is Blake. I'll kick it off and then hand over to Scott. But for most of the growth -- 50% of our growth in international markets comes from our top tier countries, U.S, India, UK, Australia, Mexico, Brazil. So, that's where most of our growth comes from. We don\u2019t break it out by country. I think growth overall in our markets is strong and it's good. Some of those markets are new, very new for us, as you pointed out Asia. Asia is super new for us. We've only been there a few months. We're happy with the results that we're seeing there. And frankly we don\u2019t think it's going to be super contributory in 2016. Asia is only about 4% of our total revenues, but we're happy with it and we feel good about it and think that Asia in 2017 and 2018 will be a contributor. I'll hand over to Scott for more detail. Scott Wagner : Thanks. So Mark, just to the international question, three points. One is, growth is being driven by the same markets we've talked you about. Its share gain and just continued good performance across all those geographies. And the second is Asia, still small and too small to really affect the P&L, but we're really happy with how it's looking at out of the gate. On gross margins, margins have flattened, I think in line with what we've told everybody, certainly last quarter and even the first quarter which is they've tapered particularly as we've lapped a couple of the big 365 incentives, but we're managing the business and gross margin dollars, not percentages and kind of are happy with the mix there, and I think for the forward couple of quarters, people should expect the gross margins to be in line with what they are right now. And again, the focus for us going forward is around adding products and continuing to add gross margin dollars per customer, not necessarily percentage. Operator : Your next question comes from the line Sam Kemp of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Sam Kemp : So in terms of the new product math that you guys looking at, does that include any e-commerce or channel integration functionality? i.e. e-commerce site being able to integrate directly into say Amazon or eBay? And then can you talk a little bit about where you're seeing India? Is that accelerating demand environment giving -- contributing less coming in terms of ECN and large internet investments? And are you seeing any deviations from the historical markets characteristics as being kind of a -- more of a do it for me type customer base? Thanks. Blake Irving : This is Blake. So in product on e-commerce, we have an online store product that does surface e-commerce capability on our own website. In other markets -- and you used India an example, where things like Flipkart and marketplaces are actually more important. There is some work going to integrate in those marketplaces today. We have not integrated with our market places in the U.S. whether it'd be eBay, Amazon, SC [ph], those types of things, but we have some integration that we've done on the back end for using things like PayPal et cetera. On India, it's an interesting market and it's actually quite similar to other markets at the same level of maturity. I use Mexico as an example as well. Each one of these markets has a DIY component and a DIFM component. They all have both, but DIFM, do-it-for-me marketplaces are much more impotent in India, Mexico, Brazil because folks tend to have I think less ability to do their own websites. So we have a web program that we've got a 100,000 developers in now and frankly quite a few of those developers are from India. And they are building websites for other folks in their marketplace. And frankly 50% of websites today are not built by the owner of the business, they're built by web pros, and we think that's a very large marketplace and an important marketplace for us. Operator : And your next question from the line of Sameet Sinha of B. Riley. Your line is open. Sameet Sinha : A couple of questions here. Can you talk about the strategic importance of FreedomVoice and how we should think about that being integrated into the overall product suite that's sold? And secondly Ray mentioned he's looking forward to doubling revenues again in four years. Is that sort of a goal that we should also keep in mind while thinking about the Company or if it's more about looking historically? Blake Irving : Hey Sameet. This is Blake. I'll handle in a quick second. Scott will probably tag team on the doubling question. On FreedomVoice, we know that -- our customers have told us they have -- they're sole entrepreneurs in companies of only five people. They have what I guess I would call complicated lives where they are trying to manage their personal life and manage their business at the same time and many of them are trying to do it on a single phone. So what we intend to offer with the FreedomVoice acquisition as a second phone line that exists on your mobile phone. So you can tell that a phone call is coming in from a customer versus for instance, you are a junior high school kids' teacher, and be able to separate those two roles you've got of parent and business owner. From an integration perspective we end up with a really interesting signal strength, both in Website Builder and manage WordPress. So when somebody enters a phone number on their website, we have the ability to actually make an offer for them and say hey, we have a phone line that's available for you as well if you'd like to manage your business as a professional phone number. And then offer it for them. And if you think about philosophically about naming your business and actually searching for a good name, whether a domain name or just a trade mark business name, it's another opportunity for us to get in front of them with a phone number that is more relevant to their business than otherwise would be, and gives them a choice, that same kind choice you have in a domain name, where we can allow you to go into a local area code or have an 800 number to provide call trees and allow you to basically look bigger than you are, or be in a very specific location by having the right area code. I'm going to hand it to Scott on the doubling question. Scott Wagner : I think in some way that was an acknowledgement that over the last four years we've doubled. And if we look at the business going forward, you think about our customers, which are now 14 million plus. We're on a pathway where we could see trajectory to $20 million over that next four or five\u2013year period. And then ARPU, looking historically we went from the 90s-ish ARPU number to now 125 and believe with the product portfolio and the merchandizing approach we have that we're on a runway to 150 to 175. So -- and a really step back and high level math runway to 20 million customers, ARPU of 150 to 175, that's where you get the doubling. But don\u2019t hang up on the precision of the four years. Sameet Sinha : Okay, and one final question if I can squeeze it in. I know that historically the way [Indiscernible] has worked is Q3 to Q4 we seen a drop off in margins. This year with the change impact against specially, most people go in Q1, do you think there is chance that -- the way to ask is are there any sort of -- anything stopping you, anything else apart from these marketing tactics for the gross margins? Blake Irving : There is -- you said -- that's right, that the seasonal profitability has a little bit of a slight downturn in the fourth quarter. Still think about that going forward and our guidance gives you the best range of where we think EBITDA is going to land. And again that's nice 20% plus growth year-over- year Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ron Josey of JMP Securities. Your line is open. Ron Josey : I think you mentioned in the investor deck that the domain business has seen increasing strong renewals, and I was wondering if you could provide some additional context here just around renewals rates, perhaps our churns trended over the year so? And then I think your commentary around bundles in that product upsells, any update just on the updated pricing and approach, and maybe that helped drive bundles and up sell in the quarter around going -- less discounting going forward? Thank you. Scott Wagner : Thanks Ron, it's Scott. Domain renewals are -- rates are nice and strong. We don't show those specifically publicly but we're on a nice trajectory there. And really that's an offshoot of focusing on domain names that are attached to customers and even more so ideas, and brining those ideas to life. And when we get a customer a great name for their idea and help them bring it to online, as we've all seen, know and when that happens, customers stay for a long, long time. And so our domain approach has been particularly focusing the business on attaching a domain name, do an idea and then make it happen and when we do it, it shows up and great domain renewal rates and that's what we're seeing. In terms of the pricing approach and impact on renewals and churn, again mechanizing goal is to get our customers into the right set of products by name, presence, productivity that are involved around branding and naming your idea online, and getting those activated, and when those get activated, we see really strong impact on our renewal rate on a product basis. Ron Josey : And based on that, can you comment on just Flare? Is that I'm assuming directly related to what you're seeing? Blake Irving : This is Blake. On Flare, Flare is an interesting product. Flare's notion is to actually go upstream from the domain name. It's not something that we generate revenue with. We actually allow a user to put an idea out into a marketplace of folks that can comment on that idea and actually improve the idea, gets over 10 likes or what we call 10 loves, then they actually can go back forth with folks and build the idea up into something significant. Now what we get from that is a large corpus of data that we store in our backend that gives us signal strength on what that idea is and how well that might perform. And with that data, we also have an opportunity to know exactly what we can market to that person in the next instance when they are ready to take that step, whether it's domain, whether it's website, whether it's a professional email address that lets them take that next step. But we view that knot as \u2013 I wouldn't call it a money generator. It's more of a method for acquiring customers and getting them to take the first step -- that first spread step of saying, I'm going actually take a leap of faith and go and try this thing out and get enough feedback to take the first step. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Deepak Mathivanan : Two questions. First one, a big picture question. You've mentioned that 50% of the market is still built by Web Pros for website building. On that topic, can you help us boss down the growth profile between hosting and site builder? Is the demand for website building, using platforms like WordPress and then using hosting products from Go Daddy still healthy, given that there is some strong propensity to use DIY tools recently? Blake Irving : Hey Deepak, this is Blake. We're actually -- yes, 50% of the sites that are built by individuals using DIY tools and 50% that are built by Pros. So those pros are even using what you would consider to be a DIY tool to build for folks. Managed WordPress and WordPress products have actually gotten simpler to use and frankly we've seen really good growth in our managed WordPress. In fact, it's some of the fastest growing -- one of the fastest growing products we've got. Managed WordPress is doing incredibly well. And frankly, I think the market is so darn big that companies can grow in the DIY space. Our DIY business can continue to grow. Our web-hosting business can continue to grow and we just get better it both of them. The opportunity is not just in the DIY space. It's an opportunity for websites that have been out there for a while, to get them refurbished, to get them a newer updated, more responsive code basis, so they look great on a mobile device, they look great on a tablet, they look good on a PC. So that demand continues. And frankly we do something at GoDaddy that's interesting where folks say I'm going to go build this thing myself. We actually will help them when they don\u2019t want to build it anymore. And so we have a professional web services group will take that almost as a continuer if you will, where I start as a DIY customer, I might get to a point where I'm doing opt to Do-it-with-me or DIWM customer, and then say look, I'm going to hand this off to you and allow you to do it for me. So that continuum really reflects the need states of customers where they say I'm going to try it on myself, and then I'm going to basically hand it off to somebody else. And we're the only Company that is really doing that today, and more over, and I think most importantly, we don\u2019t have an opinion that is like it's DIY, and there's a proprietary way of doing DIY. We actually believe there's DIY and people are going to do it themselves, and we also believe that the hosting business and professional business is very important. And there are different tools that people use to do both. And we are the only company at scale that offers both of those things. So we offer a great website building experience at scale, and we offer a great web professional experience at scale, and things like managed WordPress [Indiscernible] Durpal, Ruby, and cloud servers that offer you pretty much any type of tool you want to use to build the site for somebody. So we're not taking sides or placing bets on either side. We\u2019re offering both, the DIY and DIFM to small companies and the developers. Deepak Mathivanan : Okay, that's helpful. And then second question. Historically domains used to be a key new customer on ramp channel for you. Now the initiatives are around bundling for the website builder products et cetera. Can you explain what the mix is like for the new growth of customers that you bring in for different products? Blake Irving : Deepak, we're still, for new customers coming into the franchise a large, large, large portion of them, all certainly still start and have a domain, but they are also attaching that domain to some form of presence and 0365. But domains is still a big tinker to the on ramp, but again it's being anchored with one or two or in some cases all three of our other products. Now looking ahead two, three years down the road we're encouraged and we're excited by the possibility and the potential for a category like what we've done for FreedomVoice, and through voice to serve as a distinctive on ramp for additional customers and to continue to go add certain segments of the market, whether they would be pros, who are big influences of downstream customers to provide experiences for those segments. So we think that there is a couple of different ways both products and channel go to market for certain segments of the customer base that are going to add different on-ramps for customers into the franchise. Operator : Your next question from Mark May of Citi. Your line is open. Mark May : Maybe Scott, just coming back to the gross margin question, I'm guessing one of the reasons why it keeps coming out is we're counter intuitive because we're still seeing hosting presence in business [indiscernible] business growing and becoming a bigger portion of the mix, you're guiding to kind of expect for stable growth. I guess we're always under the impression that the domains gross margins is quite a bit lower than the non-domains margin. So maybe if you could walk us through why that in fact is not translating into higher gross margins or your commentary on that as just sort of in the very near term that over the next year or two plus, you have a different expectation? And then on FreedomVoice, I got your sort of game plan going forward and the strategic fit. But can you confirm, the deal hasn't closed yet. Is that right? And if that's right, I'm assuming it's not in any of the numbers that you either provided or guided to? And if that's the case, I have a couple of other follow-up on FreedomVoice if I could. Scott Wagner : So first point on gross margin. The gross margin to the anniversary of a series of incentives with our partner in productivity, that enables us to provide special bundles around a productivity suite presence and a domain name for the first year. And we're lapping those first year frankly incentives that are getting to a normalized rate in terms of licensing payments for our partner, and that's normalizing gross margin at the percentage that we're at. And sorry if that hasn't been clear. We've tried to be explicit about that for the last several quarters, but that\u2019s the reason for the tapering. I think it's important to point that our EBITDA margins continue to grow nicely, all the way down through cash flow as well, because it's leveraging the model. So we've tapered the gross margin percentages now, but are seeing nice scale through our OpEx lines, particularly Tech & Dev and G&A and even over the last quarter Care as we continue to build out the business. So these things are working together and we're intentionally working them together to continue to show nice growth on top and bottom line. So hopefully that both provides context on the gross margin and on EBITDA. Specifically, on FreedomVoice, it's not closed yet. We expect it to close later this year. There's a whole host of FCC licensing requirements when you get into the voice business that makes the close longer than expected. And so that's still TBD in terms of the close. In terms of guidance, we have tiny bit, you could call it expected in the fourth quarter. We do expect FreedomVoice to close before the end of this year and sort of therefore implicitly you could say that we have it included in guidance a little bit in the fourth quarter. Mark May : And can you comment, I think there are some reports out there that the business is doing about $30 million in revenues. Is that roughly correct and is relative growth -- relative to GoDaddy business, relative margins et cetera. Scott Wagner : So that's way high. I think we had said before that it's per quarter a couple million dollars per quarter in terms of what we're going to be inheriting on a size basis. So that's the quantum of the business what we we're getting today. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason Helfstein of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Jason Helfstein : So, can you talk a bit more about marketing, regarding that -- you generally think about relative to net bookings, but it does seem like there is some consistency to revenue and kind of how you are thinking about that. So obviously this quarter we saw a deleverage on the net bookings but a stable leverage on revenue. So just kind of how guys are thinking that. And then secondly, any update on the cloud product, because I guess it's now what, two full quarters since that's been in the market. Thanks. Scott Wagner : It's Scott. Jason, on marketing; for our marketing dollars, through this year, our spending is going to be probably a lot more proportional on a quantum basis as you go quarter-to-quarter-to-quarter from just a raw dollar standpoint. And so part of that was having a consistent level of spend and mix between the U.S. and these different international growth markets that were put on our shoulder behind and seeing nice results. And that's really how to think about marketing for Q3 and Q4. More importantly into 2017 and beyond is about taking our go to market dollars in not only the markets that we're in and growing nicely, but adding more geographies. And we think that there's several nice probable possibilities for us, as well as building up and putting our shoulder behind some of these either new product customer categories or products themselves. And you will see again our marketing just go to support these different products and different geographies. Blake you want to talk? Blake Irving : Yes, hey Jason, it's Blake. The cloud product, we announced in March. So we've got basically four to five months of time in market. We're happy with the results that we've seen in cloud. It is resonating with developers and the folks that are building websites for other people which was our assumption. Frankly we feel like it's -- I wouldn\u2019t call it a significant contributor, but we're happy with where it's growing and how it's pleasing the customers that are using it. And it's a great mix for the Web Pro product line with that adding a ton of languages on top of cloud infrastructure that we weren\u2019t able to offer before. So we're happy with. Operator : Your next question comes from Aaron Kessler of Raymond James. Your line is open. Aaron Kessler : I have a couple of questions. First, any update on the number of domains into the quarter as well as your market share, and just any idea of the amortization intangibles for core ARPU that might be in the queue and also do you have potentially the dilutive shares with options as well. That would be helpful. Thank you. Scott Wagner : Aaron, its Scott. So in terms of number of domains, we have approximately 63 million domains in the portfolio, give or take right, which is again at the -- the important number there is that that's 20% of the world's domains in the portfolio. And important note is we're focused on adding domains that have customers attached. So our focus around the domain business is the names that lead to other things versus just the names themselves. So that's I think domain point number one. In terms of the amortization question, it's going to be in the 10-Q which you're going to see tomorrow, tomorrow AM. So maybe we can't pick that up either after the call or you can just find it in the Q tomorrow. And on a fully diluted basis, shares are -- if you use approximately 176, that's the number. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Essex of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Brian Essex : I was wondering if you could just touch on -- I got the 14% constant currency bookings growth, but could you give a little bit of color, on the last quarter it was a little bit -- there was a little bit confusion around duration and how much the reduction in discounts impacted the duration and therefore, the duration if you will, the duration of adjusted growth of that number. Maybe just a little bit of detail there? Blake Irving : Brian, the exact same stuff last quarter that we talked about, so free trial of the Office 365 in website builder, some of the shorter duration which is just mix related and the reduction of discounts has continued. So all of the language and discussion that we had around bookings last quarter, we have not only continued into this quarter merchandising wise but ramped they up in the case of free trial and the bookings number accelerated on a year-over-year basis. Brian Essex : And then if I could -- can't help but notice you're building a little bit of cash on the balance sheet, as rates transitions then and you build that path [ph] down, just kind of wondering what your priorities might be and how you might think about return on capital going forward? Blake Irving : So we certainly think that there's opportunities to add to the franchise, both products that are valuable on the lifecycle of our customers that probably are great standalone businesses, but maybe really good products that we could attach to our customers and technical platform and care model and add value to our customers and obviously make that economic and geographies as well. So obviously that translates into -- we think that there is good ways to use the balance sheet to grow the franchise strategically, but we'll keep in -- FreedomVoice as a perfect example for that, right, which was tiny in terms of dollars outlay, but is a good example of what we're talking about doing. And we like having the flexibility to do it and we're a shareholder and economically minded people and we're going to do that intelligently and it's going to have to be we think accretive relative to what we're doing organically. Now if we love the flexibility of having the cash both for growth and for what it can do in terms of our share count and in terms of just the economic returns of the balance sheet overtime and so it's just nice to have the flexibility to be able to do that. Brian Essex : And how might you manage debt in the process? I know it has picked up a little bit. So just kind of wondering how you kind of balance between the two? Blake Irving : I think at this point, like you said, we have cash and relative to our leverage position where we have a lot of flexibility, I think that's the way to look at it. As we've shared before, the business, if you're looking at it truly from the just operational cash generation of the business, two to four times as a really nice leverage ratio given the cash characteristics and the stability of the business. Obviously we're below that. But we're not going to attach to that ratio but I think that should give everybody an indication of where certainly comfort wise and where we are relative to those -- to that ratio. Operator : Your next question comes from Brent Thill of UBS. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Hey, Scott, congrats on your new role but with removing CFO side, where do you expect to be spending most of your time? Where do you think you are going to have the biggest impact now with that time freed up? Scott Wagner : Thanks Brent. Really this is about the go to market, international marketing, using our care organization around the world to both deliver great experience and to help enable the business. And so if you think about those three areas, we're really putting our foot down on the gas across all three. And if you add any corporate development and the flexibility we have in the balance sheet that Brian so nicely articulated and pointed out, those are sort of the four different avenues that you can think about just growth. It will be where I'm spending my time. And it's great to have Ray here, because the size of the Company now as a global public company with a financial scale around it, it just makes perfect sense to have frankly a full-time strong fantastic executive on the finance function day-to-day, and it's going let me spend my time thinking about those different areas of growth. Brent Thill : Okay, thanks for that. And Blake, I know understand the bundling concept better than most, given your time at Microsoft. And when you think of the bundling opportunity going forward, it just seems like there is a lot more or that you could do. Con you just talk a little bit about the strategy and what you're seeing? I know you've had domain, website, emails as one of the high fields on your website. It just seems like there's a lot more you could do there. What's your vision in terms of where you think you can go with this? Blake Irving : Brent, this is Blake. So the bundling strategy has been working well for us. We have deployed as you described, domain, website, email. Not just bundling but in application selling, which is something that Microsoft really didn\u2019t have the capability of doing back in the days of Office, because it was packaged product, where we believe that not only can you bundle products effectively and create a powerful merchandizing moment for a customer, but there are other opportunities for us to sell not just the bundle but actually sell them the thing that makes the most sense for them at a point in their product life cycle -- in the customer life cycle. And if you use the voice capability and FreedomVoice as an example, there is an opportunity for us to offer a voice capability when somebody pushes a number, which is a phone number into a website is an example. Or to offer email marketing, while it wasn\u2019t in the initial bundle, to offer email marketing when they've got a sufficient number of folks that have entered their email address into a website. That incremental capability which we'll offer on a free trial basis so they can try it out and see how it works and then use it and then get a response allows them to take that next step and grow their business further.  If you think about the hosting business, it's exactly the same for protecting somebody's website, whether it's offering site walk to them or offering a backup capability. Doing that in the product when you're in the control panel and you're actually using it. So it's doesn't necessarily have to be at the point of merchandising which we've been quite successful at, but even taking the next step and using the cloud capability and cloud functionality that all of our products exist on to offer the next best thing based on the data we have on that customer. And at a macro level the vision for us is to have enough big data on customers and enough big data on customer lifecycle and product lifecycle to know what exactly when to offer the right product at the right time to a customer's perfect situation. And you're seeing us starting to roll that capability out and I think it's pretty differentiated from what we've done before and differentiated from what other folks are doing in our business today, just a very different approach. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from James Cakmak of Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Company. Your line is open. James Cakmak : Two please. One on bookings and one on EBITDA. So Scott appreciate the color bookings, but the adjustments that you're making there seems to be working well. Do you think that conceivably based off of the learnings that you had, that we could potentially see some further adjustments down the road, or you feel comfortable that things are working, this is the new normal for bookings? And then secondly on EBITDA, if I understood correctly on the international, you are where you want to be right now and you're going to be scaling that business. Long term and EBITDA growth is holding at 20% plus. You're outperforming that. So as those, should we think of that as a base case and a measure, with also a need for a pretty decent upside from there or how to think about the long-term versus kind of the international lessons and scaling that business? Scott Wagner : So on booking, let's think about the pacing that we're on as being a good one. And I think that that's probably the best thing or the appropriate thing to say publicly. And given the size and scale that we're at, that's a big quantum of incremental growth. So we think that that\u2019s hit a pretty nice pacing for where we are right now. It is in line with those long-term targets that we shared with everybody, what's now well over a year and half ago in terms of low double, low to mid-teens, top line growth and we're squarely in that zone. In terms of EBITDA, as you pointed out, we've been 20% plus for a while. Just thinking about the growth of scale and the balance of reinvestment which is what we've been doing and quite focused on, the 20% number is a good one. The nice thing about this business and where we are is we're able to invest in geographies and products and capabilities like the in-application purchasing that's Blake describing, that are great for the long-term health of the business, but we're still able to drive a hell a lot of EBITDA and hell a lot of flow through the P&L in the short-term. And I think that's what everybody -- that we've been doing it, and I think that's the best way to think about it going forward. And those are financial metrics and performance, but hopefully people appreciate that that's a competitive advantage of the size and scale, and to be able to invest in either marketing dollars or engineers or markets at the size that we have and still produce these results is advantageous relative to other people in the market, who are doing what we're doing. Blake Irving : Just to pile on James, one of the things, what I'll call scale advantage as well, we're the only Company that services a small business that has built a platform that is scalable at a global level that allows us to add products in market all at once. And if I use the cloud server launch as an example, four months ago when we launched cloud server, we launched it in every one of the markets what we are in simultaneously. And that type of advantage of the platform we've built differentiates us substantially from other folks that offer the same type of service we do. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. I turn the call back over to the presenters. Blake Irving : Hey everybody here. This is Blake. Again thanks to Scott for all he's been doing. Welcome Ray to GoDaddy. Super glad to have you. Congratulations Scott and we hope to speak to all of you one quarter for now. Thanks everyone. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Kelly, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the GoDaddy third quarter earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Marta Nichols, VP of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Marta Nichols : Thank you and good afternoon. Thank you for joining us for GoDaddy's third quarter 2016 earnings call. With me today are Blake Irving, Chief Executive Officer, Scott Wagner, President and Chief Operating Officer, and Ray Winborne, Chief Financial Officer. Blake, Scott, and Ray have some prepared remarks which will follow with a question and answer session. On today's call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and operating metrics such as total bookings unlevered free cash flow, net debt and ARPU. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents may be found in the presentation posted to our Investor Relations website at investors.godaddy.net or on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC with today's earnings release. The matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today November 2, 2016, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. With that, I will turn the call over to Blake. Blake Irving : Thanks, Marta. And thanks to all of you for joining us tonight. GoDaddy's third quarter was another very good one, with our results again exceeding the top end of the guidance ranges we shared with you last quarter. GoDaddy's distinctive, combination of easy-to-use products, speedy perform and technology and consultative customer care continue to differentiate what we do and how together yielded a large high growth business with strong cash flow. In the third quarter we've grown the server to 13.5 million customers, an increase of over 7% versus a year ago. Our average revenue per user or ARPU also rose nearly 7% to $127 despite continued currency headwinds. We feel great about the consistency of our results, what they say about the power of our strategy and execution over the last several years and more importantly, where we are headed. We've doubled the size of the business over the last four years on the both the top and bottom lines, and we're now building on the foundation we've created with an eye toward doubling the business again over the next four years. As we look to the future I'll share a bit about what we're doing to expand our product portfolio. Scott will give you some color on our go-to-market efforts, and then Ray will review our results and our outlook. On our product portfolio, I will highlight two key elements of what we're doing. First, expanding into new onramps, beyond domains, and second, extending our product portfolio into natural adjacencies to our total core offerings. First, on expanding onramps. As you know, historically most of our customers have started their relationship with GoDaddy by buying a domain, and then building a web presence or attaching a domain-specific e-mail.. Domains have been our primary customer onramp, one that has propelled us to over 14.5 million paying customers and over 63 million domains under management. And we believe domains as an onramp will continue to thrive in the future. Over the past year you've also seen us experiment with additional onramps. For example, offering free trials of our DIY website builder to customers in a couple of countries, enabling them to try our website builder tool for a short period and then purchase a domain and attach other products. We have been pleased with the results so far. We've extended free trial into a number of new markets and we will do more of that in 2017. Another potential onramp is voice service. We hope to close the Freedom Voice acquisition this quarter and will soon begin offering voice service for small businesses, allowing them to add a second and completely separate phone line to an existing cell phone. Our customers have told us they often use their personal cell number to support their business venture, and they don't like it. They are looking forward to the greater privacy and professionalism that a second line provides. With our new voice service, it's like getting another phone for just about $6.00 per month. Voice is a new potential on-ramp for us, giving GoDaddy yet another way to introduce a customer to our services for the first time. We are really optimistic about these efforts but they are very early. Voice, in particular, is an entirely new product line for us so 2017 will be a year of testing and iterating in the category. Look, we know that most people will still name their idea with us as the first step in the journey. That implies the domain names will be GoDaddy's primary customer onramp for a long time. With that said though, we absolutely believe our broader and deeper products that now gives us permission to introduce new customers to GoDaddy using new and different onramps, so that is where we're heading with offerings like site building and voice service. On my second point about where we are focusing new product adjacencies, we often get ask what's next? What new product or category is the next big opportunity for us to offer our customers. We listen closely to the needs of our customers in considering new categories and it's clear they have many needs we can address over time. Perhaps the most important factor in deciding what is next is that any new products that should be a close adjacency, our best opportunities are those that are very tightly aligned with our core products, our customers' value offering, and some real-life problems for them. Let me touch on two examples. Website design and security. First, we continue to see a big opportunity in website design and development across a range of products and services, and not just as a product onramp as I discussed a minute ago. From simple DIY offerings like GoDaddy's website builder tool to the most popular open source tools like WordPress, which can offer pixel perfect placement and greater flexibility. We recently launched WordPress websites by GoDaddy, which makes it much easier and more intuitive for small businesses with limited design experience to get started with WordPress with an easy startup wizard mobile-responsive beams, thousands of high-quality images and plug-ins and much more, all in over 30 languages and 50 markets globally. If you want to see an example of a great managed WordPress site, though, that we host, check out WeirdAl.com. And yes, it's that Weird Al. We're also investing in Do-It-For-Me services, or DIFM, where GoDaddy builds and manages a customer's online presence, not just the websites but also for search results, social engagement, and more. And while DIY site-building gets a lot of attention, half the websites in the world today are built and managed by someone other than the business owner. In fact, we are finding that many more of our overseas customers, especially in key markets like India and Mexico, ask for site building services instead of buying DIY tools. You can see examples of the website design services we're offering at jbgolf.net here in the US. And at [indiscernible] in Mexico for prices as low as $130 per year including hosting. Hopefully you are hearing a theme here. Rather than staking our claim in one area like domains as our only onramp or DIY as the only avenue to building an online presence, it's our goal to make use of our brand and our depth to meet customers wherever they are and whatever their needs. Whether they are ready to do everything on their own or want a handhold from start to finish and beyond. And what further distinguishes GoDaddy here is not just that we're offering a range of robust site building tools from DIY to WordPress to DIFM. It's that we've built a global and scalable common technology platform that allows us to offer every one of these options to all of our 14.5 million customers globally. Now another example of an obvious product adjacency for us is security. It is clear the need for security products has never really been greater. We hear about security challenges in the news constantly so we all know the quantity, breadth, and severity of breaches is growing for organizations of all kinds, large and small. GoDaddy has always been a leader in securing our customers' domains and in SSL certification. We also know that many small businesses lack the capability, understanding, or resources to fully secure their technology and online presence. We've developed some really differentiated offerings, like secure e-mail, which allows encryption and archiving for customers like medical practices which require HIPAA compliance. And we're testing several other complementary offerings, including site backups, secure storage, site scanning and malware removal, just to name a handful. The demand is absolutely there. So you will see us offer a broader range of security tools going forward. Website building and security are just a couple of examples of product adjacencies. We believe the combination of our breadth of products and our focus on what really matters to our customers will allow us to continue to meet their needs and grow with them with these and other products over time. So we're continuing to build on the product foundation and geographic breadth we've established in recent years. We feel great about our continued progress and how our organization is now positioned to take us into the next phase of our growth. And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Scott. Scott? Scott Wagner : Thanks, Blake. Since Ray's arrival, I've been focusing my attention on our big go-to-market efforts, specifically our international growth, the evolution of our marketing strategy and execution, and how we can do more with our customers through care. Let me say a bit more about each of those three. On international, we've expanded tremendously over the past few years. We've entered dozens of global markets with localize products, payment types, and customer care in a very scaled way, with a centralized engineering platform augmented by in-country marketing spend. And this play book has worked. Our international customer base has more than doubled over the past four years to more than 4.5 million international customers. Our international revenue grew approximately 25% in constant currency over the last several quarters. It grew 27% in constant currency in Q3. New markets launched earlier this year in Asia, while still small are seeing accelerated growth. In our core tier 1 markets like India and the UK continue to scale. For example, in India, GoDaddy is now the largest registrar of both .in and .com. And in the UK, we've recently passed 1 million domains under management. And our .uk domain portfolio has grown over 50% in just the last 24 months. Going forward with the localized presence in over 50 markets around the world, the next phase of our international growth is emphasizing growing the markets that we're in versus simply adding new markets. This phase will further our organic growth efforts through a continued localization of both our product and marketing experiences. In addition, with over 4.5 million international customers in a scalable global platform and operating system, we're very well-positioned to add to our footprint to be in organic activity as well. Turning to marketing, we're focused on two things. The first is extending our brand to represent the full suite of online products and services that Blake was describing earlier. A brand is an experience. And our GoDaddy brand is about the full experience of bringing an idea to life online over time. We're extending our brand with a combination of creative messaging and highly efficient and effective marketing tactics across TV, sponsorships, and PR. Over the last several weeks, you're seeing GoDaddy show up in global markets with increasing presence across sporting events like the English Premier League Football and the baseball playoffs, as well as relevant sponsorships like Shark Tank in Mexico and Make Me a Millionaire Inventor in the US. As we look to 2017, we are exploring a number of interesting opportunities, both in the US and around the world that we believe will resonate and connect with our customers in terms of both creative messaging and tactics. Second, we're working on the lifecycle experience of our existing customers. We're working to increase engagement with our customers using our data to help trigger the right next step for each customer. Now in some cases, the right next step may be activating and using the product that they've just purchased. In other cases they are ready to move onto the next product or service. Here is a very specific example of that in action. When a customer is managing their GoDaddy account and we detect that there is a domain that is yet to be connected to a site or email, we provide them with a very simple flow to activate that domain, guiding them to our website builder product or office 365, right in the account management screen. We're also replicating the experience in our email and hosting control panels for critical add-on services like email archiving, encryption, and migration, all with one click. Ultimately, we believe success in these efforts will translate into improved value for our customers and better ARPU for us. Our third go-to-market pillar is customer care. We've always been knows for customer-centric consultative, empathetic inbound customer support. This is a special asset for us that in some ways is still quite underutilized. Even today, most of our customer interactions are reactive, responding only when our customers ask for assistance. In 2017, we'll do more to proactively engage with our customers in productive and intelligent ways. Here's a quick example. We identified a segment of our customer base which are naturals for our office 365 email solution. These are slightly larger organizations with 10 to 100 employees who typically have one generalist IT person. And they particularly value GoDaddy's product suite and our high touch service for installation and simple migration. Over this past year, we created a dedicated team within customer care to serve these slightly larger customers and proactively reach out to both existing customers and potential new customers outside of our base. This pilot has been successful, and we will be expanding this effort in 2017. Overall, we feel good about these go-to-market opportunities in front of us. How they will enable us to grow our customer base, increase customer engagement, and ultimately grow ARPU. With that, I'm going to turn it over to Ray, who will run through the Q3 results and our outlook. Ray Winborne : Thanks, Scott. As you've heard, Q3 was strong on all fronts with our results again exceeding the top end of the guidance ranges we shared with you last quarter. Our total revenue grew 15% to $472 million year over year and bookings grew more than 12% to $534 million. Currency translation this quarter was an approximately 100 basis point headwind to both revenue and bookings. As you heard earlier, we continue to see a nice balance between customer and ARPU increases, with both growing roughly 7% versus last year. Turning to our revenue lines, we saw attractive growth across all three of the product lines this quarter. Domains revenue finished the quarter at $237 million, up 10% year over year. This above-market performance continued to be fueled by international growth, strong renewals, and higher aftermarket domain sales. Our hosting and presence revenue was $174 million in the third quarter, up more than 15% versus Q3 a year ago. As Blake mentioned, we rolled out free trial of our website builder product more broadly and we've seen some good uptake in security products as well. Business applications revenue grew 36% in Q3 at $61 million, driven by continued strong growth in both productivity and email marketing. Looking at our international results, our revenue outside the US now represents over 27% of total revenue. It also grew 27% on a constant currency basis in Q3, ahead of reported growth of over 21%. We continue to believe international will be a key growth driver in the years to come given the horizontal need of our products and the strength of the GoDaddy brand and value proposition. Turning to profitability. We continue to deliver solid topline growth and demonstrate good operating leverage across the expense base. As we discussed with you on last quarter's earnings call, you will see in our release that we don't refer to our historical measure of adjusted EBITDA. We've instead provided you with the three components of that measure on the third page of the release and slide 15 in our presentation to allow you to sum them and see that it yields a total above the high end of the Q3 range we provided to you in August. As an aside, we won't provide of adjusted EBITDA guidance going forward but because that measure is a key operating metric for us internally, we will continue to report these three components so you can compare our future performance to past results. Briefly on cost lines, gross margins were down slightly versus prior year as expected, as license fees to Microsoft for Office 365 had begun to normalize. Going forward, we expect gross margins to stay close to the current range. We've gotten some leverage in technology and development spending as we expected. G&A a little, the usual amount due to onetime stop comp expense spending on a workday ERP implementation in recent acquisitions, as well as a tough comp against a year ago quarter. On a normalized basis, we remain within the range of the last couple of years. Most notably, growth in our marketing spend was a little lighter in Q3, but you'll see growth pick back up again in the fourth quarter. Turning to cash generation, unlevered free cash flow grew to 20% in Q3 to $96 million, continuing to demonstrate strong cash conversion. Over the last 12 months, unlevered free cash flow was about 16% of revenue. We finished Q3 with approximately $566 million in cash and short-term investments and net debt of $510 million. As you all know, this business generates a lot of cash, and we remain mindful of the opportunity we have to use our cash flow and balance sheet to effectively enhance equity returns through M&A and potentially share repurchases as well. So let's discuss our outlook for Q4 and the full year. For Q4, we expect revenue in the range of $483 million to $487 million, which for the full-year 2016 implies a range of $1.845 billion to $1.849 billion, an approximately 15% growth at the midpoint. Our fourth-quarter and full-year revenue guidance incorporate the expected impact of past currency movements. As I said earlier, we came in above the high-end of our Q3 guidance range for adjusted EBITDA, and while we will no longer guide on this measure, I'd note that nothing has changed fundamentally since we last provided you with full-year guidance on this measure in early August. Looking instead at cash flow for the full year 2016, we expect unlevered free cash flow of approximately $350 million representing roughly 20% growth versus the $294 million in unlevered free cash flow we generated in n 2015. In summary, our outlook for the remainder of 2016 remains strong and very consistent with what we've shared previously. Solid teams, topline growth, and faster growth and profitability in cash flow. That's a quick look at the financials. Blake? Blake Irving : Thanks, Ray. You can see that we're continuing to deliver on our strategy and financial expectations. And we see a big global opportunity to continue to grow the business long-term. So thanks for your time, folks. And we are ready to open the call to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Naved Khan from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. Naved Khan : Thanks for taking the question. Just a couple. I think Blake or maybe Scott, you spoke about the opportunity in the 10 to 100 employee segment which is kind of new. Just curious to know how you plan to go about addressing that in terms of having a dedicated sales force? Or are you thinking about some other channels? Scott Wagner : -: And we ran a pilot this year with exactly what you described, which is not only a dedicated sales force, but the installation and migration team; and we liked what we saw. So we're going to be adding a couple dozen more people both to contact and serve this population and audience. And frankly, we're excited about what it could be for us. And this is just going to be about expanding that and growing it as we succeed. -: And we ran a pilot this year with exactly what you described, which is not only a dedicated sales force, but the installation and migration team; and we liked what we saw.

And this is just going to be about expanding that and growing it as we succeed. Naved Khan : Got it. And then, since you changed your branding method a little bit, kind of moving away from the high-impact messaging, can you talk about any kind of impact that you have recently seen on the ROI for these marketing dollars? Blake Irving : Well, on messaging, to be clear, you always want high-impact marketing messaging. And from a brand standpoint, we're at this point where we as GoDaddy have 80%-plus awareness certainly in the United States, but it's frankly been fascinating to see how quickly we can ramp our awareness numbers around the world as well. So in our core, tier 1 markets, whether it's India or the UK, we have very solid awareness numbers relative to the time that we've actually been spending marketing dollars. -: Naved Khan : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Deepak Mathivanan : Hi guys, thanks, two questions for me. First on the business app, it decelerated a little bit this quarter. Can you talk about the growth inside the line in terms of different products? And I know you have been experimenting a lot with the different merchandising between different line items. Perhaps maybe you can give some color on that with respect to bookings growth or maybe customer growth for that. And then second, you called out the DIFM opportunity. What is the go-to-market strategy for DIFM services? And how should we think about the economics versus the current products that you offer? Thank you. Ray Winborne : Yes, the biz apps item, I think we did about $60 million this year, in this quarter. You look at the growth on that, we're in the 36% range. A little slower than what we'd seen in the trend. But it's on a much bigger base. If you just go back two years ago in the same quarter, we were at $30 million in that line item. So we are very happy with that growth rate, even though it's decelerated slightly. It's just continued to grow off a nice base. It's a victim of our own success there. Scott Wagner : And Deepak, it's Scott. I will talk about the second. On DIFM, or really assisted services, our go-to-market right now consists largely of ways to serve our base, through care and frankly a little bit more targeted email interactions that we're finding. And again it has nice return and we're seeing nice pick-up to it. What we are not only experimenting with but moving towards is obviously a more mass articulation of those kinds of services. Again, not only to provide that kind of activity for our existing base, which is quite large, but possibly as a way of serving new customers as well. Deepak Mathivanan : Thanks, Scott. Thanks, Ray. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sam Kemp with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Sam Kemp : Thanks, guys. On the topic of DIFM, historically you've rolled out Go Daddy Pro as one way to address this market. Now I'm hearing more about, kind of, the internal DIFM opportunity. I guess, if you had to force rank your preference between the two of them, whether it be economics or scalability, which would come first? And then, last two calls you've discussed about growing the size of the business over the next four years. I guess are we supposed to take that as a rough form of long-term guidance? Blake Irving : Yes, Sam, hey, this is Blake. So on the Pro versus the Do It For Me service, the good news is we don't have a Tour-Dejour issue here. Where we can actually do both, we build products for Pros, so when we do a new WordPress feature that allows immediate updating of multiple sites all at once, that's a feature for a Pro. When we do a good job with our Manage WordPress offering, which the Weird Owl was a great example, that is built by a Pro, using our services and using the GoDaddy Pro offerings today. DIFM are a lot of our small business customers today that don't have a Pro nearby or don't understand what that marketplace looks like around their neighborhood or even in a city. So what we do is offer an integrated service that once somebody has contacted us, once they've got a domain, they simply call our Care organization; and we put them in touch, basically a hot transfer over to somebody that can take an analysis of what they are trying to accomplish with their website, and then really just get artwork from them, get some creative iteration going with them, and for a very low-cost be able to build it for them. Now we don't offer a lot of complexity on those sites, like a web Pro does, but we have a great opportunity for a low cost to offer a super high-quality website that will help one of our customers acquire customers for themselves and retain customers, including getting the [indiscernible] and the NCO service or even managing their social presence. So we don't have to fight that Tour-Dejour issue. Ray Winborne : Hi Sam, it's Ray. Regarding that comment about doubling the business over the next four years, yes, that is our vision; and that is a long-term guidance, if you want to say it that way. We did that over the past four years with the first turn of the crank, with expanding around the world, and now we're going to continue that second crank both on product, going deeper in geographies, and more on-ramps as you've heard us talk about earlier. Sam Kemp : Great. Congrats on the quarter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Jason Helfstein : -: Ray Winborne : Hey Jason, I will take the first part around biz apps. We are really happy with that growth. It's 36% year-over-year. It's just growing off a much larger base now, $60 million of the current quarter. If you look back just two years ago, that was up $30 million number. So doubling the business is in two years is pretty impressive. So that growth rate is still a very solid growth rate and we're really happy with it. Scott Wagner : And I think from the leverage standpoint -- it's Scott, Jason. Thanks for pointing it out. Yes, it is nice to see that kind of operating leverage flowing through the business. And it's nice frankly to see that also frankly build for several quarters in a row. And that maybe not -- that won't happen nor are we promising that every single quarter, but we have ability to scale through our technical platforms, certainly through the G&A infrastructure of the company. And, but, and, and we are still investing through marketing and care in what we think are really productive ways. All of which wrap up to the ability to drive faster flow-through and faster growth to the bottom line. In terms of acquisitions, like we're not going to comment on any specific acquisitions. We\u2019ve to date made a couple of, frankly, quite small ones, in terms of product adjacencies, but the business is in a position, scale platform, operating rhythm-wise where we certainly feel like we're in the position to do something much larger, frankly productively and accretively. Jason Helfstein : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. Sterling Auty : Thanks. Hi, guys. I wanted to start with I think it was either last quarter or the quarter before, you talked about taking away some of the multi-year packages and having an impact on the bookings in the quarter. Any impacts from that that you can quantify this quarter? Ray Winborne : No. Really nothing there, Sterling, to speak of as far as extending or pulling back in on the years. I think really the only thing I might highlight for you this quarter from a bookings perspective is free trial. You heard Blake mention that we've rolled that out and continue to expand in other geographies, so that's obviously having a little bit of impact on bookings right now, because we don't count those customers until they are on subscription. Sterling Auty : Okay. Makes sense. On some of these new programs specifically security, can you talk us through what the economic model for GoDaddy looks like, in other words are you in a revenue share arrangement with technology partners? Are you paying a fixed fee? What is the margin profile on some of these new solutions they've got especially in security? Blake Irving : Hey, Sterling, it's Blake. We have a variety, basically, it's either build it or partner or it could even be an acquisition, when we're rolling out our products. The market that we've got products in today, whether it's an SSL, which is completely our own -- with SiteLock that is something that we have a partnership with. We don't really disclose the terms on that. There's a lot of other opportunities for us for a backup, for storage, for the HIPAA compliance, with archiving, and archiving of mail. Those kind of things are in different business models for each one, and frankly the way that we package them and integrate them together to make it incredibly simple makes it kind of a no-brainer for a customer to go acquire it from us. Frankly it doesn't matter whether it's partnered or created by us or it's part of another package. And the business model and the margin profile, each one of those is a little bit different, but aggregating up into a hell of a good business. Sterling Auty : But would you characterize it as being on par with the rest of the corporate gross margins? Blake Irving : Oh, for sure. Absolutely. Yes, it's a great business that fits very nicely within the marginal profile with the rest of the businesses we are running. Sterling Auty : All right, perfect. Last question -- and I'm jumping in between calls as well, so if you touched on it, I apologize. Digital marketing I think it is an area that you've looked at in terms of adjacency. Where do you feel like you are in terms of the evolution of GoDaddy strategy on that digital marketing front and what might we expect here in the near term? Blake Irving : Hey, Sterling, so it's Blake again. From a product perspective, I tell you, I think we are probably in the third inning of the game; and I'm not sure if the game goes into overtime or not, which I hope tonight it doesn't, but the general notion is -- like we're doing email marketing today. We do a pretty good job with that. We know there's a lot that we can do in the SMS area. We know there's a lot we can do in helping customers acquire customers on mobile devices. And frankly, nobody does it all together as a package. And nobody has a super well for this little customer. So the products that we are offering -- and I got to stress this really importantly -- our LTV/CAC is such that we can acquire customers at a very low cost. And we can offer email marketing products for such a low cost and integrate it into a website building product or email that just makes it, again, just a no-brainer to do that next thing to attach customers. And if we get them really early in their cycle, like I have an idea, I want to build a site. I've got now 50 customers who have signed up on my website. I'm going to offer them the free use of an email marketing product and eventually they will buy it from us. It's really early for us. It's, I'd say, third inning, probably. Maybe even that's deeper in the game than we are. Sterling Auty : That's great. I agree. I hope it doesn't go to extra innings either. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Kees from Summit Redstone. Jonathan Kees : Great. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the quarter. I just had a couple of questions. First one is more of a clarification, more of a confirmation. And second one is more of a general question. The first one being, you mentioned you're doing a lot of in-country sponsorship, local marketing. You mentioned some TV shows, but you also mentioned the English football league and also the baseball playoffs; that's here. You're not going to -- the marketing costs are going to be still more spread, right? You're not going to have the Super Bowl Spike or the NASCAR Spike like in the past, correct? Scott Wagner : Jonathan, it's Scott. I think you should see a pretty stable level of marketing spend, put the tactics aside. This strategy is around a pretty consistent marketing spend and voice. Across our markets. Jonathan Kees : Just wanted to confirm. It sounded like it too. You have plenty of things you are spending on. And second, for your international expansion you touched on like the package that you're offering in Mexico, and it includes hosting, and it was at a very competitive price. I guess the ARPU, from my calculations here for the international customer, is a little bit lower. You talked about price sensitivity and the kind of margins you get there for the international customers, especially for the non-Western Europe, tier 1, like Mexico, India, China. Scott Wagner : Thanks. It's Scott. So in the emerging markets, we're seeing very nice customer pickup, and again just from a relative return, what's great about the margin profile of these markers are they're incremental. Remember our in-country execution is pretty wide. Most of the spend we have is frankly go-to-market dollars and that's how we manage the geography. Now when you ask if the unit customer level -- what's the level of price-sensitivity -- it's not surprising that those customers are more price-sensitive. And that's frankly what we're working towards and these markets are having fantastic solutions for these customers, still at a really attractive and valuable price point. But that makes money for us. So all of these examples that we are describing have good economics for us to deliver and our hitting affordability and value positions for customers that makes it really valuable for them. Jonathan Kees : Okay. Great. Thanks for that explanation. Good luck, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ron Josey from JMP Securities. Your line is open. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, thanks. It's JMP Securities. This is [indiscernible] for Ron. I have a couple of questions. On WordPress websites, could you talk about any early earnings and where you all are in rebuilding GoDaddy's website builders. And have you taken some earnings from there to implement on the GoDaddy website builder? And how about the domain marketplace. How are you increasing liquidity with millions of websites and about $0.5 million, if I'm right, traded each year? So how do you think about it? How is the traction there? If you could give more color there, thanks. Blake Irving : This is Blake, [indiscernible]. Thanks for the question. Our website builder products, which is a simple DIY tool, is good today. Frankly it's not as good as it can be. And I think what you will see over the next couple of quarters is some pretty innovative technology from us that I think is going to be a pretty big sea change in our DIY website tool. I would also say -- and I would say that is the simple DIY one. We have another product that we just announced and released in the past month which is GoDaddy WordPress offering, which provides a super simple, easy to use WordPress offering with thousands of themes, lots of flexibility. More flexibility than any DIY tool today, so if somebody has got a little bit more technical capability, they can have a much richer, much richer, tons of plug-ins available for them to do something that is very, very flexible. So we've actually got those two products that kind of bracket this very simple and the more technically complex, trying to make sure that we are targeting folks that are more technically capable than those that are really just learning and want to treat website building as a PowerPoint tool. And doing it with really good intelligence and frankly machine-learning capability, it makes it super simple for people to build a site for them. And the domain business we have -- we run the largest aftermarket service in the world today. And the number of offerings that we've got in that aftermarket allows us to have a whole heck of a lot of liquidity. We've been making sure that that's available to every registrar so they can put aftermarket products up in that marketplace as well. And we're seeing really good aftermarket traction. So we\u2019re happy with that. It's not just GoDaddy-owned domain names. It is domain names that are owned by anybody who wants to participate as a seller in that aftermarket, or buyer. And we've done some really interesting tools, both on mobile devices and frankly on a PC that allow you to manage an auction professionally, capably and for the domain investor, it's a really good set of tools for them and a great way to go reach their potential customers, in our aftermarket marketplace. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Brian Essex : Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if I -- we could maybe put a finer point on a subject that Sterling had touched on. When you guys talk about offering free trials, I'm going to go out a limb and guess it's maybe why net subscriber ads are sequentially a little bit softer. Can you quantify the impact there? And then can you offer, I guess, I little bit of insight in terms of how that's going to impact the platform longer term when they renew at a higher price. I think it makes all the sense in the world. And I'm sure they're very strong LTV/CAC. I just want to understand conceptually how to wrap our heads around that model going forward. Scott Wagner : Brian, Scott. Thanks. Look, it's a good question and thank you for it. On pretrial, since it is free upfront and we're not counting a customer until it's paid, there is certainly some impact but it's not something that frankly we should quantify and communicate to everybody. It's one of those precise without accurate, probably, measures. I think when you bring up customer ads, I'd actually highlight two things just specifically in the quarter that probably have a bigger impact than just a free trial. One of which was in our international markets, we actually made a shift in a couple of these emerging markets to focus more on monetization than just gross customer ads. And the second thing I would point out is if you look at our marketing spend in the quarter, it was lighter on a year-over-year basis. And it certainly made a bit of an impact. I think the broad point is we don't manage to the quarter-over-quarter net or gross ads, and are focused on good customers who are going to stay with us for a long time and that's the purpose and goal of what we think about customers. Period, point, stop. Obviously we, you, everybody in the phone, wants that number to be as high as possible. But quarter to quarter, we're staying pure to the goal which is add good customers, have them grow and evolve over time. And the ideas of new organic product on-ramps plus geographic scope are going to be the levers that are going to allow us to continue to grow that customer base over a long period of time. Brian Essex : Look, I think it makes a lot of sense and certainly your performance in the quarter is a testament to that philosophy. And I guess as a tangent to that too, I think we've talked about before, Scott, your net refund rate is improving and you've shown a second quarter of sustained improvement. Is that something that you believe is sustainable, and what is primarily driving that improvement net refunding? Ray Winborne : Yes, this is Ray. We are continuing to see some improvement there. It's really coming off the improvement in the products and the customer experience. And I would anticipate as we start to continue to see those improvements, obviously there is some type of natural pull there, because as these customers grow, they are going to have -- need changes over time. So you'll always have some level of refunds. But we've pretty pleased with where that number is going. Scott Wagner : It's Scott. Yeah. We, at GoDaddy, know -- we've always had friendly and very customer friendly, refund policies and that's not going to change. Meaning if somebody is it in the wrong thing, we want to make sure we get them to the right thing. And relative to the industry, I think that is quite a favorable policy that puts us in good light relative to everybody else. I think Ray hit the relevant point on the why for the drop, which is when the quality of everything we do gets better, and the merchandising continues to improve, then you just end up with people just in the right thing, right at the right point in time. Brian Essex : Makes sense. Thank you. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from UBS. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Thanks. Good afternoon. The international growth ticked up this quarter versus the first half of the year. I'm just curious what you saw there, where that contribution came from. And then the flipside of that is the US has slowed a little bit. Is there anything you are seeing in the US market that leaves you somewhat concerned? I had a quick follow-up. Scott Wagner : Scott, Brent. So international growth being slight uptick, that's nice, but honestly relative to our pacing it is rounding. So I guess it's nice. Feel good about it, but also don't celebrate. Really, it's just kind of business mix, relative monetization focus, but it's not a sustainable thing that we're going to say is a different pacing. It sort of was what it was, but frankly relative to the pacing of the last three, four, five quarters, it is kind of dead on where we are. When you look at the US, that is our business apps conversation applied to the US. Where there is nothing different in our market performance, it merely is lapping this really big base and growth. So it's terrific growth. It's just our Office 365 revenue and implementation has a slightly higher mix towards the US than elsewhere. So that's our business applications year-over-year lapping of what is just a really big number. Brent Thill : Okay. And I know Ray had mentioned you were happy with the business apps. But when you look at 4% sequential growth, to effectively two years of straight 10% sequential growth, we all look at that metric and say there is more than a slowdown there going on. When you look at that, is that just an anomaly this quarter and you expect it to pick back up or is this sequential ramp the right way to think of it going forward? Scott Wagner : So Brent, business apps right now is productivity, as we've described for the most part. And the trajectory is one that frankly is still a really nice year-over-year. You're talking about sequential, but year-over-year it's still a nice one. Ultimately adding other legs to that biz apps tool will be what in flex it over the current trajectory. But to say that business apps could continue, we're not going to come here and say, boy, you are going to get 10% sequential growth in business apps right now. But again thinking about it over time, this is all about what products we can add to that container and what kind of success we can achieve. Blake Irving : This is Blake, Brent. Just adding to that a little bit. Remember that the voice service, which again, is something that is new for us, so it's a new product line, that does get added to that line next year. Brent Thill : Thanks for the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark May from Citi. Your line is open. Mark May : Hello. Can you hear me? Blake Irving : Yes, got you. Mark May : Thank you, I appreciate it. Question on marketing. I just wanted get an update. When you are marketing for customer acquisition, are you mostly advertising against the general means business as sort of a customer acquisition tool? Or how are you thinking about kind of leading with some of your non-domain offerings from a marketing perspective?  And a question in terms of some of the WordPress website offerings. It looks like you've got some promotional pricing there right now that's -- I think even at a fairly nice discount to your web builder product. Can you talk a little bit about how those two offerings kind of fit together and sort of what your strategy is around the website building offerings? Thanks. Scott Wagner : Mark, it's Scott. I'll do the first, and Blake will do the second. In thinking about the marketing strategy and execution, and how it relates to domains and non-domains, think about our marketing in two categories. One is top of funnel, which is TV sponsorship, brand-related activity and then direct, which is very specific spend, whether it be SEM display advertising, social advertising, etcetera. Over the past year, we\u2019ve expanded our direct spend across the product portfolio in presurgical ways, around supporting our product portfolio and that's been a very effective way of building up these services tactically, particularly to our existing base, and ultimately that translates into ARPU. On the top-of-funnel basis, that is really the work to come, to be frank, which is having our external messaging connect very directly to, not a specific product per se, but to the broad range of experiences of our customers. And that's the work from a messaging standpoint to come. Blake Irving : Yes, on the second question, Mark, your question was about DIY, our website builder product and WordPress. The interesting thing about a customer who comes to our site, when somebody comes looking for a website builder, they have been told that they should be using WordPress. So the really interesting thing is they don't trade-off of an easy to use, DIY website builder or WordPress by price. They do it by recommendation. And web influences -- as technology influencers that are usually professionals that somebody might know recommends that they use WordPress and then they start looking for it online. We happen to be one of the largest, or the largest, WordPress provider in the world today commercially. And we've made that a very simple product. So many smart business folks who actually want to build a website, have been told Go use WordPress. And so they go to GoDaddy. They click on websites and WordPress shows up. They click on it and they go down that funnel and then we're just trying to build a very attractive price for them to get into the product, try the product, use it and have a great experience. On the DIY website builder products -- I kind of characterize these things as ones a little bit more technical and pixel perfect than the other. On a DIY website builder product, if somebody who says, I just want to build a website, and this one says I can do it myself, therefore let me go ahead and click, what's the value proposition and how is that price. If they went to WordPress and they tried to use the product, even as simple as we can make it, it may not be simple enough. So the DIY product that we have built, that you will see us evolve pretty substantially of the next couple of quarters, will be incredibly easy to use, will not have that perfect -- that pixel perfect ability, as customers can get themselves in trouble, actually, when they have that much freedom. So we put up, what I will call, really good guardrails, really good intelligence, good machine learning, great library of photos and templates that will make it really easy for customers to build something they want. Our goal is to get them into a product that allows them to have a great outcome, right? To meet customers on their site. To acquire customers. To retain customers, to market to them, and frankly whatever they want to choose. Whether they've been told to go get WordPress or Pro, or they say, I want to build a website, make it easy for me. We are doing both of those things. Mark May : Great. Thanks a lot. Thanks for the color. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahoney with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Dylan Haber : Hey, guys, this is Dylan Haber on behalf of Mark. Just as a follow-up on [indiscernible] earlier question, can you provide some more color on how big of a potential revenue catalyst the domains aftermarket is? And what sort of contribution it is making now? And then also based on what you discussed early in the call about creating new customer on-ramps, can you provide examples of which products you see becoming potential feeders for the overall business? Thank you. Scott Wagner : It's Scott, Dylan, on the aftermarket. If you look at domains, our revenue performance has been 10%. We're putting up 9%, 10% growth over the last several quarters. If you think about unit growth in the industry, unit growth is anywhere from 3% to 5%. And really, our above market performance is both our international share gain in markets outside of the US, which is part of it. And then the other part is the success of stimulating the aftermarket and trying to get more names that are already bought to change hands. So without giving you a specific number, it's certainly a contributor, and a decent sized one to that, above industry growth performance. Blake Irving : And one other thing that I would just add on the domain side, Dylan, is that we have entered roughly 56 markets over the course of the last couple of years. And as we enter markets, we've been starting to offer country, top-level domains, like .MX for Mexico, .BR for Brazil, etcetera. Those are brand-new for us. And in many countries, CCTLVs actually take precedence over a .com and actually have more meaning than a .com. Certainly in Germany, Brazil, Mexico, as examples. India's .IN is very important. For the on-ramp question, we talked about two view on ramps. One is, hey, I want to build a website and then I'm going to go attach a domain to it, and I want you to think about that as, I want to try the tool. I want to see how beautiful I can make this thing. And then I'm going to commit. And that's about it. We're frankly moving the payroll from in front to behind it, allowing somebody to try a website builder, and then attach a domain. And that is happening today. So we like the results we've seen there. The other on-ramp that you will see us endeavor on in 2017 is voice, where we think that somebody is going to say, Man, I've been using my private phone number, my cell phone number, for my business. I put it up on my website. It's there for everybody to see. I feel like I might be in danger of having either my identity ripped off or maybe being encroached. So providing them a number on their cell phone that rings through to either a business voice mail that can transcript into a text that shows up in your inbox. Those things are super powerful features that a small business or somebody with an idea can use. And frankly they may do that without getting a domain name or without getting a website from us. We're going to package them up in ways that make it look like it's absolutely perfect to get all three of these things, at a really attractive price. But it's an on-ramp all by itself. We think it could be a really interesting way for people to get a service relationship with GoDaddy. Dylan Haber : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : There are no further questions in queue. I'll turn the call back over to the presenters. Blake Irving : Great, thanks, everybody, for our third quarter results call. We look forward to talking with you in one more quarter. Thanks and enjoy the game tonight. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Mariama, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the GoDaddy Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Marta Nichols, VP of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Marta Nichols : Thank you. Good afternoon and thanks for joining us for GoDaddy's fourth quarter and full-year 2016 earnings call. With me today are Blake Irving, CEO; Scott Wagner, President and COO; and Ray Winborne, CFO. Blake, Scott, and Ray have some prepared remarks and then will open the call up for questions. On today's call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and operating metrics such as total bookings, unlevered free cash flow, net debt and ARPU. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP measures to their GAAP equivalents may be found in the presentation posted to our IR site at investors.godaddy.net or on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC with today's earnings release. The matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements, which include those related to our future financial results, new product introductions, the acquisition of HEG and the possible divesture of HEG's PlusServer business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC. Risks related to HEG also include uncertainties regarding the timing of the acquisition, retention of customers and employees and our ability to successfully integrate HEG into GoDaddy and divest the PlusServer business. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. And any statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today February 15, 2017, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. So with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Blake. Blake Irving : Thanks, Marta. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. Look we feel great about how we close 2016 on a strong note with another year of consistently good growth in the books as well as a definitive agreement to acquire HEG in hand and a strong product and marketing roadmap for 2017. As we complete our second year as a public company, our results and growth have remained very consistent with continued solid growth across all our major revenue lines; domains, hosting and presence and business applications and over 20% growth in cash flow. At year end 2016, we've grown the server over 14.7 million customers, an increase of 7% versus a year ago. Our average revenue per user or ARPU also rose 7% to $130 despite continued currency headwinds. We finish 2016 with revenue over $1.8 billion, up 15% year-over-year. Bookings crossed to $2 billion mark in 2016 and domain bookings topped to $1 billion for the first time illustrating both our scale and leadership position in the industry. This year we look forward to generating continued growth in both revenue and cash flow fueled again by both organic customer ads and growing ARPU, in addition to the contribution for our expected acquisition of Host Europe Group or HEG. Our strategy is consistently focused on growing GoDaddy in a steady and sustainable way over many years and that focus remains unchanged. We see huge opportunity in the months and years ahead and we intend to go after it in the same deliberate way we have over the last several years through 2017 and beyond. We are starting this year with some big product and strategic initiatives including, one, the launch of GoCentral, our entirely new mobile optimized website builder that does so much more than just create an online presence by combining easy and elegant site building with fully integrated marketing and e-commerce tools. Two, the acquisition of HEG which dramatically expands and strengthens our footprint in Europe. And three, the upcoming launch of our new telephony offering smartline. I am going to spend a little time on GoCentral and then turn it over to Scott and Ray. With GoCentral, our web presence team is re-imagined and completely rebuilt GoDaddy's entire website building experience from the platform up with a focus on what businesses want results. Including not just building an elegant website, but driving and attracting visitors and driving sales which is basic information like the name, address and type of business or idea. GoCentral smart learning system generates in your complete website pre-filled with relevant sections and professional images that can be easily and intuitively edited. Every site built on GoCentral is fully mobile responsive, so it will immediately look great on phones, tablets and computers, but no additional work required. More importantly and totally unique to GoCentral, users can build, customize or update their site on the Go entirely from a phone or tablet. In other words, an industry-wide belief that you couldn't build a great looking website with a mobile device. Our team hypothesized that if a mobile site builder was easy to use and produced a fantastic looking site on any device including a PC would see a relatively quick migration to mobile site building. That hypothesis appears to be right. So far 20% of new GoCentral customers are building sites from their mobile devices making this a very key differentiator and an important new on-ramp for us. It reflects on how other experiences have evolved on mobile, I think in Facebook. Most people didn't use Facebook on their phones years ago until the experience was optimized to be great on mobile and now the vast majority of Facebook activity is on mobile and more than half of their users only access via mobile. In short, allowing customers to build directly on a mobile device is a big differentiator for us especially meaningful in emerging markets where everything is mobile first and often mobile only. GoCentral\u2019s other big differentiator is GoDaddy smart learning system. We've integrated this new site builder with several key features to make the critical stuff really easy. For example, with GoCentral you see website activity updates when you log in you get suggestions like attaching the social networks, you can quickly begin search engine optimizing your site or launch an email marketing campaign. More importantly, while we started with dozens of smart features to help you design a beautiful site in under an hour where the smart learning system really shines is deeply integrating GoDaddy's other offerings to help our customers acquire and connect with their customers. We are working to help our small business customers get results and achieve success quickly and easily. We are confident that anyone developing a web presence for the first time or even replacing their old site will agree that GoCentral is incredibly easy to use and produces a terrific result. We've made GoCentral free to get started with no credit card required, so people can try out GoCentral and get going with the tool as easily as possible. You can even publish on your own domain name for free. I encourage you all to try GoCentral out and build your own site. With this product launch GoDaddy now offers a complete range of products to help customers build a great online presence from do-it-yourself to WordPress to professional design services. We now offer the industries premier mobile first DIY website builder fully integrated with marketing and e-commerce. Our managed WordPress toolset that makes it super easy to build, update, monitor and maintain a site in WordPress, and a professional web services team who can help build or remake a customers online presence to their specs. And each one of these offerings has built on a global and scalable technology platform that allows us to offer each of these options to everyone of our customers globally. We\u2019ve got a lot more aligned up in 2017 and we\u2019re already putting points on the board. I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott now to talk a bit about our marketing strategy and provide more color on HEG. Scott? Scott Wagner : Thanks Blake. My focus over the last six months since Ray's arrival has been on our big go-to-market efforts, specifically the evolution of our marketing strategy and execution, our international growth and how we can do more with our customers through care. Today, I\u2019ll say a bit about our marketing and international efforts. First on marketing, we\u2019ve returned to the Super Bowl broadcast this year to launch GoCentral, kicking off a broader campaign that place to the cultural and commercial power of the Internet. Our ad drove millions of viewers to the GoDaddy\u2019s website with a very effective digital extension tactic yielding millions of video views across multiple channels in our best Sunday ever for new customer sign ups. In their analysis of this year\u2019s ad forums reported ours among the top five attention generating ad with this year\u2019s game. Everyone knows the Super Bowl help put GoDaddy on the map, but decade ago, massively expanding the Company\u2019s brand awareness, but our purpose this year was different. This year, the game provided a great forum to introduce GoCentral, which Blake just spoke about and kick off a larger campaign, focused on showing no one knows the Internet like GoDaddy via new character who personifies the Internet. In the coming months, you\u2019ll see more of the Internet character and GoCentral across many channels in tactics as we showcase GoDaddy\u2019s expertise in building, expanding and protecting the ideas that the Internet loves. With this new campaign, we have a marketing message that wings are GoDaddy brand to the breath of our product portfolio and the outcomes we deliver for our customers. In the context of our overall marketing spend this year, the Super Bowl represents just one, relatively small tactic in a global marketing strategy that delivers very effective and efficient customer acquisition relative to the high value we generate for customers around the world. And turning to international, I want to spend a moment there on our progress and how HEG fits so well with our globalization strategy. GoDaddy\u2019s international business finished 2016 at nearly $500 million in annual revenue. The addition of HEG will bring us to well over 6.5 million paying international customers or more than 40% of our total customer base, making our international business on its own bigger than most companies in our category. As we shared with everyone in December, HEG is highly complementary to our existing business with similar customers, fantastic leadership team, strong customer unit economics, in an exceptional financial profile. The deal dramatically strengthens our position in Europe and we see clear upside for HEG\u2019s customers from GoDaddy\u2019s products, technology platform and care. In 2017, we\u2019re focused on first bringing our full GoDaddy product portfolio to HEG including domains, SSL, managed hosting and productivity applications. Second, integrating our global tech platform and care operations across Europe. And third, accelerating go-to-market efforts in key European countries. We feel strongly there is much more to this acquisition and buying a European footprint and customer base. The combination with HEG will expand our team in Europe from fewer than 10 professionals to 100, who can accelerate our overall business in Europe. Finally, the financial characteristics of the HEG acquisition are positive we expect the acquisition to be accretive to free cash flow in the coming 12 months. So that\u2019s a quick update on marketing and international and with that, I\u2019m going to turn the call over the Ray. Ray Winborne : Thanks, Scott. Our Q4 and full-year results were strong on all fronts with revenue near the high-end of our guidance, good leverage across expense base and cash flow ahead of our expectations. Total revenue in Q4 grew 14% year-over-year to $486 million and bookings grew 13% to $525 million. Currency translation this quarter was an approximately 100 basis point headwind to both revenue and bookings. We saw solid growth across all three of our product lines this quarter. First, domains revenue grew 11% year-over-year in Q4, fueled by international growth as well as strong renewals and aftermarket domain sales. Our hosting and presence revenue increased 14% as we began rolling out our new website builder and we\u2019re seeing some good uptake on security products as well. Business applications rose 29% driven by continued strong growth in both productivity and email marketing. Turning to profitability. We continue to demonstrate good operating leverage across the expense base. Unlevered free cash flow jumped 46% in Q4 to $77 million and 21% for the full-year to $357 million, continuing to demonstrate strong cash conversion at about 19% of revenue. Just a couple of points on cost. No higher than usual G&A expense in Q4 included $11 million in acquisition cost primarily related to the HEG acquisition. Excluding these costs, we've done some good leverage in G&A and technology and development spending as expected. Clearly the combination of our solid topline growth and good expense leverage continues to generate strong cash flow for us. The release provides you with the three primary components of our internal EBITDA measure to allow you to compare to previous results. Note those components should be adjusted to exclude the acquisition cost I just mentioned for comparability purposes as they were not included in our prior guidance. On the balance sheet, we finished the year with approximately $573 million in cash and short-term investments and net debt of $500 million. On that note, I am pleased to announce that earlier today we finalized approximately $2.5 billion in new term loans, fully replacing our existing term loan and providing full funding for the acquisition of the HEG mass business. We lowered our interest rate by 75 basis points and extended the term loan maturity date to 2024. In addition, we increased the capacity on the revolver by an incremental $50 million to $200 million total affected with the closing of the acquisition. The reduction in rates versus our prior term loan and initial financing expectations on the HEG mass deal should result in annualized cash interest savings of upward of $15 million. We separately received commitments for our bridge loan of approximately $530 million associated with the acquisition of HEG's PlusServer managed hosting business, which GoDaddy intends to divest post close. The bridge loan was not part of this recent financing. As we shared in December, the HEG acquisition is expected to take us up close to the high end of our targeted leverage range. However, given the very attractive cash flow characteristics of the combined businesses and the expected divestiture of PlusServer, we expect our leverage ratio to be roughly three times by the end of this year. So let's discuss our outlook for 2017. Just a quick note to this outlook includes no contribution for PlusServer. For the full-year 2017, we expect revenue including HEG of $2.18 billion to $2.22 billion representing approximately 19% growth at the midpoint versus 2016. Assuming HEG closes in late April or early May, we expect the mass hosting business to contribute approximately $130 million in revenue this year. Before I turn to cash flow, let me touch briefly on how we\u2019re thinking about future growth. Since the IPO, the Company has consistently said that it expects domains revenue to grow roughly in line with total customer growth, hosting and presence revenue to grow at approximately one to two times array of customer growth, and business applications revenue to grow at roughly three to four times customer growth. We've nicely outpaced those rates in recent years and for those of you building models these are good rules of thumb to use going forward. Specifically on domains, as we look into 2017, we are lapping some strong secular and Company specific growth drivers that allowed us to meaningfully outpace the industry. So we look for domains to grow closer to the customer growth going forward. Quickly on Q1, we expect revenue for standalone GoDaddy in the range of $485 million to $490 million implying a little over 12% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Note that Q1 of 2016 included an extra day due to leap year, which we estimate added approximately 1% to our growth last year. Turning to cash flow. As we've highlighted for the last couple of quarters, we are transitioning from providing guidance on adjusted EBITDA to unlevered free cash flow. For the full-year, we expect unlevered free cash flow for the combined company of $460 million to $480 million implying approximately 32% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. This excludes expected acquisition and integration cost in the range of $20 million to $30 million this year. As a reminder, we target 70% to 90% conversion of our internal measure of EBITDA down to unlevered free cash flow. We expect to be at the midpoint of that range this year driven primarily by more meaningful tax distributions tied to increasing profitability. As we said in the past, unlevered free cash flow is lumpy on a quarterly basis and you'll see that clearly in our first quarter results this year. One full employee period will move from Q2 a year ago into Q1 this year which we expect to result in a $15 million reduction in free cash flow in Q1 versus last year. You'll obviously see the reversed effect in Q2. That's a lot of detail intended to give everyone a roadmap to 2017 including HEG. Taking a step back, we continue to create franchise distinction and competitive advantage with the business growing double-digits on the topline and 20% plus in unlevered free cash flow over the long-term. Rolling that into 2018, we see a business on track to generate unlevered free cash flow of approximately $600 million next year. With that, I will turn the call back over to Blake. Blake Irving : Thanks, Ray. To briefly summarize what we've shared today and more excited about what the future holds for us. Double-digit organic revenue growth through a combination of customer and ARPU increases, new product and on-ramp launches in 2017 including GoCentral and smartline. The acquisition of HEG with 1.7 million new customers adding scale and international with the opportunity to extend a successful business model to Europe. A new capital structure with a very attractive interest rate and maturity profile and strong deleveraging characteristics providing the ability to use the balance sheet to drive even faster growth in free cash flow. You can see that we have an action pack year ahead and we look forward to continuing to deliver against our strategy with products, technology, care and world-class marketing. We are excited for 2017 and see a big opportunity to continue to grow the business long-term around the world. Thank you for your time. And we're ready to open the call to your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Naved Khan, Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. Naved Khan : Hi. Thank you very much. Just a question on the Q1 guidance, at the low end it looks like it implies sequentially maybe even a little bit down to flat and now we are in February already with the half of the quarter to the belt. Can you just kind of layout for us what's taken to the expectation? Ray Winborne : Yes. Let me start Naved with just the guidance that we provided you guys. First of all, we're big. I mean this Company has doubled in size in the last four years. We crossed the $2 billion mark in bookings in 2016, so growing off a lot larger base now. Second within those product line items, we've grown very quickly outpacing the industry. A simple way to think about 2017, we expect hosting and presence and the biz-apps lines to grow at roughly the Q4 exit rate. What's different in that guidance is domains. We've grown at a double-digit clip fueled by new TLDs in the aftermarket. The aftermarket is lumpy though and it's difficult to drive that same level of incremental growth over what now is $1 billion revenue stream. So we\u2019re continuing to outpace the industry, but closer to customer growth in the mid-to-high single-digit range. Blake Irving : Yes. I think the two comments just to add in our midway through the quarter. It's good. Good results so far, steadier she goes and echo something that Ray said in his script. Remember, we have leap year which is just a little bit of a Q1 specific issue. Naved Khan : Okay. Thanks. And then quickly just on the business apps. So this is the \u2013 I guess the second quarter in a row where we saw some deceleration which is coming down from 40s to I guess mid-30s in Q3 and 29% this quarter. What\u2019s a good sort of run rate that we should sort of be expecting for 2017 is 28%, 29% kind of the good number, mid-20s or how do you see this business evolving? Blake Irving : Yes, I mentioned in the script Naved. We're targeting that three times to four times customer growth and our exit rate coming out of Q4. So that's about the right way to target this. Naved Khan : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Sterling Auty : Yes, thanks. In the quarter, hosting and presence revenue was there anything that can drove maybe a little bit of mix where more revenue when into business applications or just more color on the results there and I have one follow-up. Blake Irving : No Sterling, there is really nothing that would have driven any difference in those two line items. Sterling Auty : Okay, and then as a follow-up, you talked about the 6% customer growth, how should we think about that in terms of the sourcing international versus domestic in 2017 and beyond? Blake Irving : Yes, so first that was about 7% growth in customer growth and going forward, obviously we\u2019re going to continue to see higher mix of new customers coming out of international, just given our continued penetration in Tier II and Tier III markets as we move forward? Sterling Auty : Okay, great. Thank you. Scott Wagner : The one add on Sterling is again our customer base in the U.S. is growing. It's growing nicely and as we think about our product portfolio and expanding our product portfolio, obviously using those new products to drive additional customers as part of the strategy. Sterling Auty : And if I can sneak one more in just following on the original question, I am getting hit with a lot of questions about the Q1 guide. You mentioned the one day or 1% impact from leap year, and few other things, but maybe if you can talk to \u2013 just people look at the subscription business and layering on, just wondering how it could be flat or even down and what traditional is going to seasonally strong quarter for your industry? Scott Wagner : Yes, back to what I mentioned on domain Sterling. We're just continuing to see grow over some various large secular lift we've got. We've been outperforming the industry for a couple years now grown that double-digits. So while we would love to continue to do that as that base gets bigger and bigger. It's hard to grow with those same rates. Sterling Auty : Okay, thank you. Blake Irving : Yes, Sterling I\u2019ll pile on a little bit. Domains are still strongly outgrowing the industry and we believe we'll continue to do that just entered a lot of countries where we're picking up their country domain names, ccTLDs very large portfolio of TLDs in the aftermarket perform as well as that becomes more liquid as well. So I think we'll still see as a growing industry, but you did see a little bit of a slow. Sterling Auty : Got it. Thank you, guys. Blake Irving : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney, RBC. Your line is open. Mark Mahaney : Thanks, a couple of things. Two numbers questions. First, I think your guidance that implies organic revenue growth of 12% for 2017 just to get a check on that. And then I think Ray you mentioned $600 million unlevered free cash flow in 2018 that would imply something like 28%, which should be I think a little stronger than your kind of long-term 20% guidance, but is that because you get more of a I guess a full-year contribution from HEG's at why that growth rates higher than what you're forecasting for the long-term in 2018? Ray Winborne : Yes, Mark let me start with the organic on GoDaddy standalone. Yes, that 12%-ish plus is what we're telegraphing to you guys? When you look forward to the $600 million unlevered free cash flow, we've been telling you that the standalone business is going to grow 20% continue to believe that and where we have strong convictions around that growing at the 20% rate, the additional tech on you're seeing there. You get an extra quarter of HEG coming in next year in 2018 as well as run rate synergies by the end of 2018 for that acquisition. So that gets you the rest of the way there. Mark Mahaney : Okay. And then in terms of the timing of the new products, GoCentral et cetera, Could you just maybe Blake, could you talk about how those things layer in? I\u2019m sorry there is the voice product those central and names the third one? Ray Winborne : Well, we mentioned a couple Mark. Mark Mahaney : Yes, so GoCentral, we're about two weeks into the GoCentral announce when we launched that with the Super Bowl and that's if it basically it's a 30-day free trial. So the top of the funnel looks really good on that we're super pleased with the way that customers are engaging with it. Trials are rolling really well, but we'll see more when we start seeing those trials convert and we get a better feeling for that over the course of the next 60 to 90 days as we see published rates that are being paid for that to happen, but we are pleased with publisher right now, we're like and what the top of the funnel looks like and we expected that to translates to conversion. But honestly this is a new on ramp for us. So we're not building that into the forecast because we just don't know how that\u2019s going to affect and especially the mobile piece of this where we've got a product that is pretty spectacular on mobile devices, which is by the way most of the world actually gets online now. Voice, the voice launch, a smartline is going to be in the second quarter this year, so you'll see that rollout again and this is again another new on ramp for us, which we're not going to speculate on how big we think that's going to be. We're being pretty certain on what we know, which is why we're commenting and what we're commenting on our guidance. But we're again pretty bullish on the product and the use cases are pretty game changing for small businesses actually. Mark Mahaney : Thank you, Blake. Thank you, Ray. Blake Irving : Thanks Mark. Operator : Your next question comes from the Sameet Sinha, B. Riley. Your line is open. Sameet Sinha : Yes. Thank you. Couple questions here. So first, just wanted to confirm on HEG $130 million, if you annualize that that comes to let\u2019s say about $195 million in revenue. How does that compare to the booking? What\u2019s the equivalent booking there? And secondly, could you give us an update on some of the other new products you had announced last quarter, you are talking about the DIY site builder, if you try to get that \u2013 you are talking about GoCentral, but is that incorporate other site builders as well the DIFM and your security products? Ray Winborne : Yes. Sameet, it\u2019s Ray. I\u2019ll start with the first question. We talked about what their annual bookings were when we announced the acquisition in December. It\u2019s about $236 million growing in the high single-digits. The $130 million number we've given you guys for the guide takes into account, the conversion to U.S. GAAP. So there will be deferral or domain registrations as an example amongst multiple adjustments we\u2019re making there as well as the partial year. We're expecting close in late April, May timeframe. Blake Irving : Yes. Sameet, it\u2019s Blake. I\u2019ll follow-up on the new products that launched. So look the two that I think are substantive over the last couple of quarters is number one, a managed WordPress offering that is incredibly simple to use along with a pretty amazing capability to update multiple sites in bulk for developers. Those two features that we launched in the fourth quarter of 2016 are things that are pretty darn important for us and actually service a different customer, a customer that's a little bit more advanced that once more flexibility then as just an easy DIY site and actually differentiates our Company from other folks because it gives us a full range of solutions from very, very simple DIY to a more comprehensive site building experience that allows ultimate flexibility and customizability. We rolled that out in Q4 and then followed very quickly on the heels of that in the first few weeks of 2017 with the GoCentral product, which is a mobile optimized experience for DIY site building does a great job on mobile, great job on PC's, has 1,500 verticals that it supports and we have a smart learning system that actually grows with the customer and suggests what they should do next as their lifecycle grows. So as they grow with us, we'll suggest things that they ought to be doing next. Those are the two things that the big things that we've done in the past two quarters including this quarter that we're in right now and I would say that on security, we've got some big opportunity in security. We have a great business there today. We think there's other things that we can do and I think you'll see more about that from us and hear more about that in the third quarter timeframe. I think that's probably the long and short of it. Sameet Sinha : Thank you. Blake Irving : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason Helfstein, Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Jason Helfstein : Thanks. Two questions and a housekeeping question. What's making you excited about focusing on basically GoCentral and website building as the marketing funnel and out of the CPAs in that compared the traditional hosting CPAs, that\u2019s question one. On business apps, obviously it\u2019s slowing as we pointed out. Do you need to sign new partnerships for that? Do you focus on more the upsell opportunity to HEG, so just some color? And lastly any help on CapEx for 2017 would be helpful? Thanks. Scott Wagner : Hey, Jason. It\u2019s Scott. So first of all let's call it site building or presence. The very first thing you do with a domain name is you attach it to an online presence. And we at GoDaddy bode through the building of the business over the last 10 years, 15 years in the variety of ways in which we do it already supporting more sort of paid and active sites in various forms and frankly anybody else around the world. Now the interesting thing about presence and I think this is what Blake was highlighting through GoCentral is, when done super well and in a connected way it can be really the dashboard of the connective tissue to add all sorts of other applications. Whether it would be marketing or marketing services or SCO, so on and so forth. So the real tenant of GoCentral is about certainly getting somebody a great online presence, but then it's really the connective tissue about what else you add in and do with that site to be successful. Blake Irving : I'm just going to tag team Jason. So it\u2019s Blake. The other thing that I think is important to note and it's not a nuance is that people want to try the tool out. And when you have a tool that is easy to use as GoCentral and allows you to use it and trial on a mobile device as well. We heard from many, many users that every solution out in the market today is too difficult for them. We optimized for incredibly simple both on mobile devices and on desktop and made sure that they had an opportunity to use the tool as an on-ramp. So they could experience it without having to commit dollars upfront which is sometimes a barrier for folks, allowing them to use it, say holy macro this thing is really great, now I'm going to attach a domain to it, I'm going to publish it, I'm going to buy a domain, I'm going to do email and do the other things that follow on afterwards. And we're seeing what we thought we were going to see, we're seeing published rates that are increasing, we're seeing the top of the funnel interests that we liked and 20% of those sites are being of new customers, let\u2019s say it\u2019s new customers coming into GoCentral are building the site completely on mobile. Scott Wagner : And so Jason in our math which back to your acquisition question, what that means is this can be both an attachment product for us that turns into an ARPU driver and a vehicle to add some new customers, and obviously we're going to continue to figure out our marketing spend around that that math, but we think it's attractive. On HEG business apps specifically and what else we can go do business applications and the opportunity there is one of the \u2013 what we\u2019d call low hanging fruit things that we're going to focus on in 2017 which is taking what we think is our frankly distinctive and best in class way to get a productivity suite over to the brands in Europe and that's one of the things that we're going to do both with the two leading HEG brands and the UK and Germany, and obviously, use that as an excel rant for our position in Europe. In terms of the CapEx question, I'm just going to let Ray hit that for the last one. Ray Winborne : Yes, Jason for CapEx in 2017, continue to model 3.5%, 4% of revenue. So you could pencil in the $70 million number and we'll highlight for you guys as we move through the year in the integration capital that might be included. Jason Helfstein : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark May, Citi. Your line is open. Mark May : Thanks guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had two. Based on a couple of emails I've gotten here. I want to try to clarify the HEG guidance. I think some people are trying to use the bookings number that they have for last year and kind of a 15% growth number and backend kind of what your guidance implies. I'm assuming that some of the issues in doing because it implies that there might be a pretty meaningful slowdown that you're guiding too. I assume that there are some purchase price accounting, some GAAP translation and other impacts that are affecting that. I don't know the best way of addressing it, but maybe what is implied or embedded in your guidance in terms of organic growth or looked at another way the impact that those various factors maybe having on your numbers this year? And then my second question is more of a kind of a product and pricing strategy question? How do you guys thinking about that this year? I know web builder kind of to some degree represents a bundling of various prices and you kind of get a bundle discount. Are you guys pursuing kind of a different product in pricing strategy this year attempting to drive more volume maybe at the expense of our bill? Thanks. Ray Winborne : Hey Mark, it\u2019s Ray. I'll take the first one round HEG bookings. We disclosed in December that 2016 bookings would to be around $236 million, growing in the high single-digits. The $130 million number that we provided in the guidance is the U.S. GAAP revenues. So we've attempted to go and estimate the purchase accounting as well as the conversion to GAAP, primary difference being deferral of registrations, domain registrations and then also obviously taking the haircut for timing between April and May. And then as you saw with GoDaddy, when it was taken private. You will also see purchase accounting applied where you get a haircut at the acquisition. So all those factors are going into reduce that number you might expect to see off bookings. Scott Wagner : From a pricing strategy, on your question Mark, bundling is certainly something that the Company has done for a long time and we're going to continue to do whether it's within a category or across and pretrial of our application is again something that we've done in the past and we're going to continue to do is a way of having customers, try our product and make it super simple for everybody to try each one of our applications whether it's something for presence or e-mail or down the road for voice because we found when people try our product and use it then they're going to stay for a long, long time. So that strategy is going to remain the same from a financial and guidance perspective. There isn't anything that I would highlight about that approach that would kind of change the numbers or the trajectory that Ray was describing. Blake Irving : Hey, Mark. This is Blake. I\u2019m going to pile on just for a second. I think if you think about bundling, some of the things we\u2019ve done, I\u2019ll just call it in product discovery, a feature is wind on in particularly with GoCentral, while somebody is building their website and it's the first thing they do, instead of getting a domain, we actually scan the contents of the domain, the business category, the user selected, the geography, where the user is and will suggest to them. Domain names that are not taken or that could be in the aftermarket that are things that they might want to do next. And that's a feature that that somebody actually needs and it's a good example of something that's in product discovery and in product marketing. That's kind of even a step further than just plain bundling allowing them to discover something at the moment they need it. And actually the feature they need exactly the right time in the right place. And we think that actually is going to be I think a very helpful, bundling tool as well. Mark May : Thanks. Blake Irving : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from Sam Kemp, Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Sam Kemp : I would be pretty honored to be Shan Kemp. In terms of the guidance, can you call it any core GoDaddy FX that's baked into that organic growth rate number? And then on your net ads, it looks like a down year-over-year again in Q4 maybe call out any contribution to that and what's really causing that? And then last is you've talked for a couple of years now about rolling out non-website specific business applications things like paid media or CRMs, so from loyalty and coupons. Can you just kind of give us an update on the timing on when you're thinking about rolling out those different products? Thanks Scott Wagner : Yes, Sam, this is Scott. So, on the first one for FX, from a guidance perspective very little, we will highlight that again FX impact that shows up in bookings rolls into GAAP in the prior year. So there's a little bit of that that flow through of last year's bookings rate flowing into this year's GAAP revenue. From a customer ad perspective, I think we talked about this in the fourth quarter, also which is really in the second half of last year. We intentionally had a less quantum of customer ad growth in a couple of our big emerging international markets as we frankly focused on monetization. And as you guys know this is a balance between customer ads and ARPU that we are certainly balancing and what we want are really good customers who are trying to bring an idea to life and get a name and then activate it and use it over time and that's a balance. So we're not managing our customers to a specific quarterly number, but are going to continue to balance customer ads and ARPU growth as we build up the business. I think on your last point of business apps and some of the various marketing services. I think that's down the road in 2017 and those are specific applications and in some cases productize services that can really hang off the back of GoCentral. Those aren't necessarily dependent upon GoCentral, but they go very well. So those are the kinds of things that you're going to see us spending more time on as we continue to build up GoCentral. Sam Kemp : Great. Thanks. Operator : And your next question comes from Michael Turrin, UBS. Your line is open. Michael Turrin : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Scott, you talked about the Super Bowl ad, but sort of described that it is a relatively small piece within the larger strategy. I was wondering if you can talk about some of the other things you might be doing on the marketing side, any changes upcoming in 2017. And then on the customer ad side in Q1, are there any impacts we should expect from the ad campaign? Scott Wagner : So from a strategy standpoint and from a marketing standpoint, again the fundamentals of it are being a efficient and effective customer acquisition tool in vehicle, right both in the U.S. and around the world and that's going to continue. What is interesting about not just our ad, but this personification of the Internet and from a brand messaging standpoint is we know of a vehicle that we can connect GoDaddy to the broad range of experiences that our customers go through online. So when we think about TV advertising or online video and social presence, it's going to be much more in a connected way about all the variety of things that our customers do with us and that's also going to help translate into ARPU, right. So that is a shift, but a good shift from just every marketing dollar going to straight acquisition to helping support not only acquisition, but also ARPU generation and I think those are the salient points to your question. Michael Turrin : Great. And then international revenue growth continues to come in strong mid 27% on constant currency basis, which is pretty consistent throughout the year, but the U.S. revenue looks like it's sticking down, is that a lot of large numbers, some of these impacts from domains getting to a certain scale or what's the right way to think about that? Ray Winborne : Now I think it's exactly what you think about it. It's just a much larger entity in itself and given the weight of domains in there in is that slowing. That's the result you're getting there. Michael Turrin : Great. Thanks a lot guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Ron Josey, JMP Securities. Your line is open. Ronald Josey : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I had two please. Blake on GoCentral, we made a few references of you just starting out on the product and then potentially selling domains or other services once you have the website during the trial period. Do you think over time GoCentral can be the domain on ramp or aiming on ramp for the Company, clearly it's domains, you\u2019ve talked about voice. If GoCentral like a change in terms of potentially how you go to market knowing of course you just launched it three weeks ago. And then the second question just where you are in the launching 11 new countries in Asia. Can you just talk about the progress here, what you've seen brand awareness things like that? Thank you. Blake Irving : Sure. Look, we view GoCentral as just another on ramp, what domains are still \u2013 are the lion\u2019s share of our on ramp, then we will continue to be the lion\u2019s share of on ramp, when people globally think of a Company where they're going to go get a domain name, they think of GoDaddy. They think of it in the United States. They think of it in India. They think of it in the UK. We are becoming a share leader around the world and it\u2019s the first thing that they think of we're over a million domains in the UK. We're number one in India in both .in and .com. So we've seen that on ramp, be a great on ramp, for some we'll continue to do so. We do think that there's a number of folks that want to try the tool out and use something before they buy a domain and frankly if they've bought a domain already they can still use GoCentral and apply it to that domain and do that without using their credit card. So we think it's another on ramp just like we think the smartline product is going to be another on-ramp as well, but domains will continue to be a strong on-ramp for us. On Asia, about a year. We are happy. Good uptake. Brand recognition is moving up as we expect it to. We're seeing a good uptick in China as well as we've surrounded China and in Hong Kong and in Singapore and in Taiwan. And frankly, what we think we're off to a nice start, but it's a small base and it's not going to be something that we think is going to be substantively huge, but look we're happy with where the Company is going and where we are right now. Ronald Josey : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from James Cakmak, Monness, Crespi, Hardt. Your line is open. James Cakmak : Hi, thanks. Scott you mentioned HEG helping you guys accelerate the go-to-market efforts in Europe. And just arguably the synergy as well as that you have somewhat imperative. Can you just kind of talk through the playbook there on how you\u2019re thinking about tackling that market. And I guess what gives you confidence that bring emphasis there is not going to dilute your efforts in other international markets. And then just quickly secondly, it looks like ARPU accelerated somewhat this quarter anything to call out there as well? Scott Wagner : Hey, James. Thanks. I think first just take a step back and look at international over the last four years which is we have meaningfully grown the international business and entered series of geographies both in Europe and in the emerging world and I think proven both to ourselves and everybody else that there's business to be add and that we can enter these geographies. In Europe, I think we've said this in the past; the UK is certainly our largest market. And our growth and performance there both in size market share gain accelerated growth kind of has shown us that our value proposition particularly has legs certainly in the UK, but also in Europe. Now GoDaddy traditionally on the continent hasn't spent as much time, energy, money and so our relative positions in every individual country are still relatively small. In aggregate it's a decent size, but in every single country they're still relatively small. And so what we get from HEG is certainly a market position in Germany that we can work from as well as frankly some team platform capability and scale when we talk about technology, infrastructure, care that we can use this frankly again in a platform or underlying foundation that we can go into a couple other geographies from a go-to-market standpoint and accelerate growth. And I think your other comment on ARPU acceleration, anything to call out. Nothing specifically other than \u2013 it's just the model of work in terms of good products, the products attaching and frankly our balance of customer and ARPU growth, right and bringing in customers who are going to monetize and renew. So frankly when you're looking at that ARPU acceleration, in many ways it's the model that work as a result of our acquisition decisions four quarters ago about the customers that we're bringing in and then the renewals of the products that they were initially brought in on. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Essex, Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Brian Essex : Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. Scott, I was wondering I guess maybe just touch on or maybe Blake if you care to. It looks as though a lot of the new features and products that you rolling out are more kind of SMB our consumer facing. For any kind of leveragable to your developer community in terms of accelerating time to market for developers on a mobile apps for example, and how do you think about how the developer community or maybe the legacy Media Temple Group is growing relative to the rest of the Company? Blake Irving : Yes, Brian. This is Blake. The interesting thing about GoCentral is it's built on the same platform that our WordPress work is built on. So a lot of the libraries that are being used for GoCentral today, same libraries being used for WordPress, the OpenStack infrastructure that GoCentral sits on top of the same infrastructure that our new offerings in the developer community are taking advantage of and the pieces of the product launches that I talked about in fourth quarter both in the managed WordPress community and managing multiple sites for developers. Those are built again on some of the same technology that you're seeing GoCentral out of. And some of the things you could notice in the T&D line is we're starting to get significant, through 2016 really got significant leverage out of our tech and dev because we're using common components across the product lines. So we're actually seeing good lift and I think some good use of tech across both developer or capability, managed WordPress capability for small businesses who have a little bit more advanced capability than somebody who wants to use a DIY site. I don't expect the developer community to use a DIY product that's very simple. I know that a lot of the things that we've learned in building this product will start showing up on mobile devices and our entire mobile framework for not just small businesses and consumers, but for developers and you'll see that over the course of 2017 and into 2018. There's a significant amount of leverage that we're going to get out of what we're calling basically the go framework that sits underneath the GoCentral product and the developers are going to benefit from that as well. Brian Essex : Got it. Maybe just a follow-up, mix of developer versus I guess we call it DIY internationally and how might those dynamics differ from U.S.? Blake Irving : Yes, developers internationally model pretty similarly to developers in the U.S. there's a difference between whether if you were depending on how deep you want to go. There is actually a bigger like Flex is a bigger thing than cPanel is in Europe; well cPanel dominates in the United States which is a pretty significant delta. I think there's \u2013 we don't see big differences in the characteristics, WordPress is big everywhere. I think that we're seeing most of our sign ups for our GD pro products actually coming from outside of the United States today. We think there's a big opportunity, a lot of sign ups in India in the developer community. And one of the things I would say that we know that 50% of small businesses don't have a website and of those 50% of businesses are going to build it, 50% of those businesses are going to have someone build it for them and those are the customers and that's globally those are the customers we think we have a great opportunity with attacking the developer community and creating a great platform for them. Brian Essex : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jonathan Kees, Summit. Your line is open. Jonathan Kees : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have a couple follow-up. One, I just want to take the discussion about the HEG and international, basically you mentioned you have like market positions in Europe now that you can work from and enter other geographies within Europe. As you look into the new year while we're in February already and you have limited budget, advertising budget, sales and marketing budget. Are you shifting resources from Asia to Europe in order to enter those other geographies? And then the second question I have is \u2013 can you talked about going for those highly efficient, highly effective tools, ad tools like the Super Bowl compared to which should before I mean that\u2019s the small part of the strategy, but in terms of the advertising budget that would be a big part. Are you going back to more of a seasonality in terms of your advertising? That's it. Thanks. Scott Wagner : Hi. It\u2019s Scott. I think your first question is anything being diverted into Europe. Sure answer is no. So we're growing in Asia and we're going to be able to approach Europe because of the increased scale of the business that allows us to obviously then invest a little bit of that into go-to-market in the same formula that we have now. And the second, in terms of the seasonality, no it's not going to affect the seasonality of the business, again this Super Bowl, the math of this is if single-digit million dollar spend on the quantum of what we do want on a go to market, it's a small amount. Jonathan Kees : Okay. Great. Thank you. End of Q& A Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to the presenters. Blake Irving : Thanks everybody. It's Blake on behalf of Scott, Ray, Marta and the entire leadership team. Thank you for attending our 2016 earnings report and we look forward to talking with you in another quarter. Thanks very much, bye now. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Marta Nichols, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Marta Nichols : Thank you, Kelly. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for GoDaddy\u2019s first quarter 2017 earnings call. With me today are Blake Irving, CEO; Scott Wagner, President and COO; and Ray Winborne, CFO. Blake, Scott, and Ray have some prepared remarks and then we will open up the call for questions. On today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and operating metrics such as total bookings, unlevered free cash flow, net debt and ARPU. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents may be found in the presentation posted to our Investor Relations website, at investors.godaddy.net or on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC with today\u2019s earnings release. The matters we\u2019ll be discussing include forward-looking statements, which include those related to our future financial results, new product introductions, our ability to integrate recent or potential future acquisition and achieved desired synergies including our recent acquisition of HEG and the possible divesture of HEG\u2019s PlusServer business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.

I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Blake. Blake Irving : Thanks, Marta, and thanks to all of you for joining us today. GoDaddy\u2019s first quarter was another great one. We\u2019ve seen consistently solid growth, we closed the HEG acquisition right after quarter-end, and we\u2019re executing on a strong product and marketing roadmap for 2017. GoDaddy\u2019s unique combination of easy-to-use products, performance technology and consultative customer care continue to differentiate what we do and have together yielded a large high growth business with superb cash flow. In the first quarter, we\u2019ve grown to serve 15.1 million customers, an increase of nearly 7% versus a year ago. And the composition of that customer base has changed dramatically over the last few years. At quarter-end, we reached nearly 10 million domestic customers and over 5 million international customers. Our average revenue per user or ARPU also rose over 6% to $130, in spite of continued currency headwinds. Our growth strategy in 2017 remains consistent with what we\u2019ve done over the past two years since the IPO. We\u2019re focused on continued double-digit top line growth fueled by organic customer adds and expanding ARPU with the addition of the contribution from the Host Europe Group or HEG acquisition, which we closed last month. We continue to see a big opportunity to serve small businesses globally and we have plans to bring them more and better services this year and beyond. We started 2017 with some big product and strategic initiatives; including one, welcoming HEG\u2019s employees and customers to the GoDaddy family and preparing to do much more for them and the millions of potential customers we see across Europe; two, the launching growth of GoCentral, our entirely new mobile optimized website builder; three, the soft launch of our new telephony offering SmartLine; and four, adding new security offerings via the acquisition of Sucuri. I\u2019ll spend a little time on our progress on products, including GoCentral, SmartLine and Sucuri, and then I\u2019m going to turn it over to Scott to discuss HEG, and Ray for our financials. First on GoCentral, look we\u2019re just stoked about its progress. As we developed this product we focused on making it possible for a small business or anyone with a great idea, not just to build a great-looking and super-functional website quickly, but more importantly to drive real success to help our customers attract visitors, promote their ideas and drive engagement. And while it\u2019s early, we\u2019re still doing lots of testing. We\u2019re seeing great initial traction with a completely new product and business model. By the end of the quarter, the number of new websites published each week was growing by more than 50% year-over-year, and mobile usage remains really impressive. About 20% of sites built with GoCentral were started, edited or published from a mobile device. Over 60% of the customers visiting the e-commerce sites built with GoCentral are buying goods on these sites via a mobile device, which really underscores our mobile optimization thesis. In short, our customers are using mobile devices to build websites using GoCentral and their customers are using their mobile devices to buy goods from those sites. At the end of March, we launched a first version of GoCentral in over 40 countries in 27 languages, which will be iterating on throughout 2017. It\u2019s too early to conclude anything from the results, but anecdotally we\u2019ve been super-pleased with the initial results. International customers of GoCentral already make up about half of our GoCentral sign ups. It\u2019s clear that customers love building a website super easily in less than an hour with GoCentral. You will too, if you haven\u2019t tried it, go for it, I think you\u2019ll love it. Beyond the results we\u2019re seeing in market, we\u2019re also really encouraged by the release and iteration cadence around this product. We\u2019re operating with a level of agility and sophistication we simply didn\u2019t have a couple years ago. We\u2019re iterating very quickly on GoCentral, rapidly spinning up new markets and new features, evolving our merchandising and more. On a weekly basis, we\u2019re performing A/B tests to look at customer responses to features and purchase flows. And where we see better results, we\u2019re immediately moving toward the winning models. All of that is giving us the ability to continue to quickly add new mobile focused features that customers want, including SMS messaging for e-commerce, and popular payment options like Apple Pay and PayPal One Touch. We also added a new blog feature complimenting our marketing integration features as well as tons of new content and images supporting nearly 2,000 categories of near complete website templates for everyone from electricians, to dog sitters, to florist. With this GoCentral product launch GoDaddy now has a full range of options. We can help customers build a great online presence anyway they choose, whether they want to do it themselves with GoCentral or develop and host a WordPress site with more sophisticated templates and plug-ins or have one of our professionals build or remake a site to their specs. As I said, it\u2019s still early, but I honestly couldn\u2019t be prouder of what the product team has built and what we\u2019re continuing to bring to market here. Now beyond GoCentral, our soft launch of SmartLine is also now available at godaddy.com/smartline. SmartLine is built on the technology from our FreedomVoice acquisition. It allows our small business customers and everyone of you to add a second and completely separate phone line to an existing iOS or Android phone. This offers a really intriguing value proposition for anyone who wants a second line or doesn\u2019t want to publish their personal phone number on their website. Here too we\u2019ve been consistently iterating on the product flow and design specs to make it feel super intuitive and familiar. We\u2019re optimistic about SmartLine\u2019s potential. It\u2019s so easy to sign up and use, and the price point is really compelling, it\u2019s just a few bucks a month. We\u2019re going to be iterating on adding features over the next several months, including SMS and MMS texting, 800 numbers and custom vanity, domain numbers and more. We see real potential here, but this is an entirely new product line. So we expect 2017 will be a year of testing and iterating for us. We also recently acquired Sucuri, a small website security company led by an exceptional team of experts who\u2019ve developed a very innovative and up and coming website security product portfolio. Sucuri is very similar to our FreedomVoice acquisition in that it provides a strong specialized product to a small cohort of customers but has a much larger opportunity. Sucuri gives website owners tools to scan their sites, respond to hacks when they occur, virtually patch vulnerabilities and more, and it provides a great complement to our growing WordPress presence. Sucuri is a leader in security awareness and security management of WordPress websites. Their customers are very similar to ours, and we expect them to benefit from Sucuri\u2019s strong legacy products, including malware scanning, web application firewalls and other offerings, which will be introduced into our customer base later this year. So with the launch of GoCentral and new products like SmartLine and Sucuri offering, we have a lot going on and see a lot of opportunity in 2017 and beyond. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Scott now to talk a little bit more about our integration with HEG. Scott? Scott Wagner : Thanks, Blake. My recent focus has been on our big go-to-market efforts, specifically, the evolution of our marketing strategy and execution, our international growth and how we can do more with our customers through care. Since we closed the HEG transaction in early April and our integration touches on all these topics, I\u2019ll provide a quick update on how we\u2019re progressing there. Overall, we feel great about where we are with HEG which, combined with our existing European business, has been renamed GoDaddy EMEA and is being led by the fantastic HEG leadership team. Combined with HEG, GoDaddy now manages over 71 million domains globally and serves nearly 17 million customers in over 100 countries around the world. We told everyone back in December that we expected $20 million in annualized revenue and cost synergies by the end of next year. We\u2019re making good progress against these targets. On the product front within days of the close GoDaddy\u2019s SSL certificates and domain aftermarket experiences were fully integrated into the HEG\u2019s legacy brands. On the expense side our joint integration teams have also begun executing on go-to-market and technical infrastructure opportunities. Finally we welcomed our new EMEA colleagues with a tight on-boarding experience, on day one everyone of our over 1000 new employees had a GoDaddy.com email account, access to many of our internal employee systems and walked into GoDaddy rebranded offices. Looking ahead, we expect to bring a broader range of products to GoDaddy EMEA customers and to grow ARPU by bringing our consultative care practices to bear there as well. And we\u2019ll scale administration, technical infrastructure and care as we build a single EMEA operation. So that\u2019s a quick update on the HEG, I\u2019m going to hand it off to Ray now to cover the financial picture including our Q1 results and full year outlook, which now includes HEG. Ray? Ray Winborne : Thanks, Scott. In Q1 we continue to execute well on all fronts with a strong product roadmap, revenue at the high end of our guidance 25%-plus underlying growth and unlevered free cash flow and new opportunities to leverage the business model with the closing of HEG. Our total revenue grew 13% to $490 million year-over-year and booking grew 12% to $625 million. Currency impacts abated a bit this quarter yielding only a 70 to 80 basis point headwind to revenue and bookings. We saw a nice balance between our two primary revenue drivers with 7% growth in customers and a 6% increase in ARPU versus last year. Briefly on our three revenue lines, domains revenue grew 10% year-over-year in Q1 this continued above market performance was fueled by international growth, stronger renewals and higher aftermarket domain sales. We continue to look for a organic domains business to grow closer to our customer growth over the medium to long-term. Our hosting and presence revenue increased more than 11% versus Q1 a year ago in line with our expected growth of roughly 1 to 2 times our customer growth rate. As expected growth slowed a bit versus 2016 as we began shifting our website builder business model. As we rolled out GoCentral on our free trial basis we\u2019re driving strong adoption and publish rates but as we\u2019ve expected we\u2019re seeing less near-term revenue in bookings versus our additional pay up front model. Business applications revenue grew 30% in Q1 driven by our growing product suite and customer base. International continued to grow nicely up 20% year-over-year on a constant currency basis and contributing over 27% of total revenue in Q1. We continue to believe international will be a key growth driver in the years to come given our footprint, the horizontal need for our products and the strength of the GoDaddy brand and value proposition. Beginning in Q2 HEG will be consolidated into our reported results before the next release we\u2019ll file an 8-K with HEG\u2019s historical financials and pro forma financial statements to reflect the combination of GoDaddy and HEG for the full year 2016. As you\u2019re building your models I point out a few differences between historical numbers and future results. HEG\u2019s historical results were reported under International Financial Reporting Standards and included PlusServer, which we intend to divest. The pro forma financials reflect adjustments for purchase accounting, conversion the U.S. GAAP, changes to the capital structure and expected carve out of the PlusServer business. Accounting rules require the pro forma\u2019s to be presented as if the acquisition took place on January 1, 2016. So they won\u2019t be apples to apples to the results we\u2019ll report in Q2. As we begin to consolidating HEG, we\u2019ll highlight the differences so that you can model the combined business appropriately. Turning to cash generation, unlevered free cash flow grew 13% in Q1 to $114 million. Unlevered free cash flow growth would have been more than 25% excluding the impact of an extra pay period in Q1 this year versus a year ago, which I mentioned to you on our call our last call. This is just timing so we\u2019ll see the reverse effect in Q2 producing an easy comp versus the prior year. For the first half of the year we expect the unlevered free cash flow growth rate to normalize at approximately 20% for standalone GoDaddy. One quick point on cost, higher than usual G&A expense in Q1 included about $6.7 million in acquisition and debt refinancing cost. Excluding these costs for getting leverage in G&A and technology and development spending as we expected. On the balance sheet, we finished Q1 with approximately $671 million in cash and short-term investments and net debt of $402 million. We closed the HEG transaction after the quarter end, so we\u2019ve provided a table at the back of the earnings release highlighting changes to the capital structure. Namely a new $1.4 billion term loan, a $533 million bridge loan and incremental cash added back to the balance sheet. This puts our post close leverage at roughly 4 times. For those of you modeling cash flow, we expect cash interest payments to be approximately $25 million per quarter including $5 million per quarter associated with the bridge loan. We expect to pay off the bridge loan when we divest to PlusServer. Quickly on the status of that divestiture, we recently launched the sales process in earnest and our goal is to complete the process before year end and we\u2019ll certainly update you further when we have something definitive to share. As we told you in December when announced the HEG deal, the divestiture PlusServer combined with growth in cash flow is expected to bring our leverage ratio down to roughly 3 times by the end of 2017. As you all know our business generates a lot of cash and we remain mindful of the opportunity we have to use our cash flow and balance sheet to effectively enhanced equity returns. So let\u2019s discuss our outlook for Q2 and the full year. Just a quick note that the outlook I\u2019ll provide includes no contribution from PlusServer as we intend to divest of it. For Q2 including HEG\u2019s contribution, we expect revenue in the range of $548 million to $553 million. For the full year 2017 we\u2019re raising our revenue range to $2.195 billion to $2.225 billion. Let me provide a bit more color on HEG\u2019s expected contribution to and impact on our reported results this year. First, HEG\u2019s revenue will be reduced by a standard purchase accounting adjustment. So the HEG revenue included in GoDaddy\u2019s financial results will initially be lower than what HEG would have recognized on a standalone basis. Throughout 2017 HEG\u2019s reported revenue contribution will ramp as the impact of purchase accounting lessons. That translates into a Q2 revenue contribution from HEG of $40 million, which we expect will move higher in Q3 and Q4 to yield a full year revenue contribution of approximately $140 million. Second, a quick note on ARPU, reported ARPU next quarter will be lower as it will only include one quarter of HEG revenue rather than a full year as the GoDaddy calculation does. We intend to provide you with a pro forma calculation so that you can see that underlying trend. For the full year we are raising our expected unlevered free cash flow range for the combined company to $465 million to $485 million implying approximately 33% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. This excludes expected acquisition and integration costs, which we intend to break out for you through the course of the year. While that\u2019s a lot of detail, we hope it provided some clarity on expectations for this year both on an organic basis and including the contribution we expect from HEG. Taking a step back we continue to create franchise distinction and competitive advantage with a business growing double digits on the top line 20%-plus in unlevered free cash flow and even higher growth on a leverage free cash flow per share basis over the long-term. Looking out to 2018 assuming continued organic growth along with an incremental quarter of contribution from HEG plus our expected acquisition synergies, we continue to feel confident the business can generate unlevered free cash flow of approximately $600 million next year. So that\u2019s a look at the financials and outlook. And I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Blake. Blake Irving : Thanks, Ray. And we hope you can see how we\u2019re continuing to deliver on our strategy and our financial expectations. We see a very big global opportunity to keep growing this business over the long-term and we\u2019re very excited about the prospects for 2017 and beyond. Thanks for your time and we\u2019re ready to open the call to your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Sam Kemp from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Sam Kemp : Great, thanks for taking my question and congrats on other solid quarter. This is the highest net add quarter that you\u2019ve had since early 2015. Is there a way to break out the impact of this Super Bowl ad impact? And can you give us an update on the international customer count at this point? And then secondly, one of the benefits that you guys have talked about from having a better DIY website-building product is the ability to participate in DIY-specific customer acquisition channels like SEM. Is that something that you\u2019re already putting to work? And if so, have you seen any early traction there?. Thanks Scott Wagner : Hey, Sam, it\u2019s Scott. Thanks. You\u2019re covering a bunch of ground there. First of all, I\u2019ll wrap in the customer adds, first, I think if you take a big step back and you look throughout our history, not just 2015 to today, but certainly from 2012 forward, you\u2019re seeing our net customer adds being really consistent, hovering around 1 million net adds plus or minus in every given year. And you\u2019re kind to point out that this quarter was an uptick, but again, we\u2019re not managing our customer add number on a quarter-to-quarter basis. So this isn\u2019t something to get particularly excited about for the quarter. However, if you take a step back and again look at the consistency of what we\u2019ve been able to deliver around the million net adds every year, that\u2019s something I think to get excited about. When you asked about the Super Bowl and then GoCentral, I think the Super Bowl is one element of our marketing mix. And so when we use marketing, it is strategic to get our brand and our value proposition in front of our customers, and we use top of funnel and very direct marketing to do that. And so there\u2019s not one single marketing tactic or lever that you can attribute things to. It\u2019s just the strategy and the value proposition overall. Now I will say that GoCentral is and will, as it continues to build up, serve as an additional on ramp, but again, it\u2019s too early to actually see any immediate contribution. So there\u2019s nothing necessarily that GoCentral is contributing in that number. And I think the last comment or question you had was around international. And as we said in the script, GoDaddy\u2019s organic business international customers were just a shade over 5 million at the end of Q1. And now including HEG, it\u2019s nearly 7 million. Sam Kemp : Great. Thanks for your color. Operator : Your next question comes from Ron Josey from JMP Securities. Your line is open. Ron Josey : Great, thanks for taking the question. I\u2019m going to dive a little bit deeper on GoCentral and maybe Scott on your comment there on it will service non-ramp eventually. Can you just talk about maybe the attach rates you\u2019re seeing on those using GoCentral and those that are coming through and building their websites in a more traditional manner? And then bigger picture here on GoCentral, I think you\u2019re still seeing a 30-day \u2013 or offering a 30-day free trial. Wondering why even offer a 30-day free trial? Why cap it? And why not let the customers decide how long they can keep and then pay up if needed? Scott Wagner : Thanks, Ron. So in terms of attachment rates, we\u2019re happy out of the gate with not only the level of attachment but just the activity on the product. Blake mentioned the number of new publishes. That\u2019s the metric that we\u2019re really looking at right now, which is just getting a raw number of sites published in the first weeks of launch. Obviously, that\u2019s garnering a lot of activity. In terms of free trial, when we think about not only GoCentral but our other applications like e-mail, we\u2019re finding that a 30-day trial is just a terrific merchandising mechanism to allow customers to try to sample the \u2013 just build up their initial step from a product. And then those who have an intended use at the end of 30 days convert and pay. And so we found not only through GoCentral but certainly our experience with Business Applications that\u2019s it\u2019s a great, consistent merchandising tactic to bring people under the franchise. Now in terms of how we evolve that going forward, there may be certain things that we allow customers to have a free experience, but that\u2019s something that we\u2019re going to think about and work over time. Blake Irving : Hey Ron, this is Blake, just kind of piling on. One of the things that we were pretty explicit about, at least in our call script today was we are A/B testing quite a bit. So I think that is in terms of what the product packages are, what conversion looks like. Is it a 30-day free trial? Can it be longer? Do we sample with e-mail and post e-mail at a different rate to try to get somebody to initiate not just to publish but a conversion? All these things, we\u2019ll be doing over the course of the coming months. To learn more about what our customers look like globally, I mean, we just entered 40 new countries within the last 35, 40 days. And we\u2019re learning a lot about these customers. So we\u2019ll continue to A/B test our way into what we think is just frankly better and improving performance. Ron Josey : Blake, that\u2019s super helpful. If I could just follow up on that A/B testing. Is that something that\u2019s available for all products within GoDaddy or built specifically into the GoCentral infrastructure?. Thanks Blake Irving : No \u2013 yes. Ron, so we A/B test more than GoCentral. So we A/B test even the front of site. So the merchandising we do on the front of site, you will not find the same thing there from one browser session, clear your cache to the next session. You can find something very different because we\u2019re running tests on that site for merchandising as well. So all the way through the GoDaddy system, you\u2019ll see us doing things that are different, depending on who you are as a user, whether you are \u2013 have signed in, whether you\u2019re cookied, whether we think we\u2019ve seen you before. So we\u2019re pretty precise on how many different tests we\u2019ll run, just to make sure we\u2019re doing the right thing from a merchandising perspective and trying to personalize for a customer segment. Ron Josey : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Lloyd Walmsley : Thanks. I think you guys had said last quarter you expect Hosting and Presence and Biz Apps lines to grow at approximately the 4Q exit rate. It looked like Hosting and Presence slowed a little bit. Is some of that just the timing associated \u2013 you kind of alluded to in the script, timing associated with GoCentral? Do you expect that to kind of catch up as new subscribers age and start moving beyond the free trial? And then a follow-up on GoCentral, just curious what you\u2019re seeing in terms of sign-up mixes for the higher-priced products? Are you seeing more and more people up for those higher priced products? Any color you can share there will be great. Scott Wagner : Hey Lloyd, it\u2019s Scott. In terms of the growth rate of the specific segments, the direction that we\u2019ve given around Domains growing roughly at the rate of our customer base, Hosting and Presence being one to two times the rate of the customer growth, and Business Apps being three to four are really the best goalposts to think about the growth rates on a particular quarter and kind of what we can see ahead. And if we look at each of those, the applications, both Hosting and Presence and Biz Apps, fell into those ranges pretty nicely, and Domains was a little over that onetime guidance. But again, we\u2019re going to hold and counsel everybody in the mid- to long-term to kind of think about domain growth being roughly in line with our customer base. In terms of the sign-up mix for the higher-priced products, what\u2019s nice about GoCentral is we have a rich set of features whether you\u2019re selling physical goods or adding certain applications like e-mail marketing or productivity or SEO optimization. It can be added right through the app, the app meaning the GoCentral editor. And so as customers are building sites and then particularly, as the customers who have let\u2019s call it a more purposeful intent for their site, we\u2019re seeing a nice mix of those applications being added, either added to GoCentral or just the feature mix within GoCentral, reflecting the intent of those customers. Blake Irving : Let me pile on. This is Blake. One of the things that we know about our customers is it\u2019s a life cycle type of business for folks that are starting out. And what we wanted to do with GoCentral is provide them an easy path to get their website started, make it super simple. And as an example, when they want to add a product, they don\u2019t intend to sell initially, but they\u2019re just a service provider, and then they want to add a product to make it super simple for them, while they\u2019re in the editor to just say, I want to add the ability to sell products, which actually initiates a new plan with a new price point, which we\u2019re very clear with them about. But it allows them the flexibility to start simply and then move up from there, without having to go through a natural lax to move to the next tier. Hope that fills it out for you. Lloyd Walmsley : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks guys. Blake Irving : Sure. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Jason Helfstein : Thanks. I\u2019ll ask two questions related to HEG. Now that you\u2019ve closed and spent time looking at the business, can you talk about your thoughts about accelerating the Business Applications there as far as upselling your relationship into that business? Also thoughts about the HEG customer acquisition and kind of how that compares to yours. Scott Wagner : Yes. Hey, Jason, it\u2019s Scott. In terms of applications specifically, I\u2019d probably elevate it out and say we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve got a very purposeful product strategy that we\u2019re executing against. So two things that I mentioned on the call, our SSL certs and our domain aftermarket experience literally within two to three days of the close, those were up and running and transferred. The next set are the whole domain purchase flow and search experience, which is proprietary advantage of ours. The second, we\u2019re jointly merging some of our hosting products. There are some things that HEG does really well. There are a couple of things, particular around Managed WordPress, that we\u2019re bringing that way. And so that\u2019s in the second tier. And then the third thing, as you mentioned, is Business Applications. And we continue to feel good about the prospect of both what we built here and its potential over in Europe. But I\u2019d say, it\u2019s one of a number of product things that we\u2019re pretty excited about in terms of bringing the full range to the product portfolio over to Europe and building it up. And overall, I\u2019d say customer acquisition, as we shared from the stats on the investment, HEG has not built as much of a customer acquisition engine. Now the customers that HEG has have fantastic retention rates, great value, so it\u2019s a terrific, stable franchise. And obviously, what we\u2019re doing now with the joint team now, our joint EMEA team, is looking at each of the specific markets and building go-to-market plants which are going to be a little different whether you\u2019re in the UK or Germany around how we can enter the market. But it\u2019s going to be with the same lifetime value, cost of acquisition stats and the same go-to-market model that we\u2019ve been running for a long time. Ray Winborne : Yes, Jason, it\u2019s Ray. The only thing I would add on to that is, like we\u2019ve mentioned in the past, the main branding spend will be behind the GoDaddy name. And to Scott\u2019s point, the LTV to CAC on that has been pretty consistent and strong, and we think we\u2019ll be able to get a little advantage there relative to what HEG was doing. Blake Irving : Jason, it\u2019s Blake. I\u2019d just characterize generally the entire \u2013 the integration operation and what we\u2019ve been able to accomplish with the teams just up to this point is pretty amazing. So we feel good about the integration, the planning that we\u2019ve got. We\u2019ve got great leaders on both sides that are engaged, moving really fast, and we\u2019re feeling great about the progress. Jason Helfstein : Thank you. Blake Irving : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Essex from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Brian Essex : Hi. Good afternoon, and thank you for taking the question. Maybe if I could point to HEG, and if I were to look at their historical performance, can we get a sense of how much was organic versus acquired? And how much was customer growth versus pricing? Just to get a sense of the kind of core drivers to their revenue growth. Blake Irving : Yes, Brian. If you look at their historical numbers, obviously, they\u2019ve been adding acquisitions through their history. But on an organic basis, they\u2019re growing in the mid- to high-single digits and from a customer perspective, a little lower than that. So there\u2019s a nice mix of price and customer adds on a historical basis. Brian Essex : Got it. And then maybe if I can kind of switch gears a little bit and get into ARPU. You had a nice, consistent ARPU growth on an average bookings basis, LTM bookings per customer is up very nicely. How much of that is mix shift towards Business Applications, Hosting and Presence versus any kind of base attach rate for the core GoDaddy business? Blake Irving : Really haven\u2019t seen any shift there, Brian. If you look at the quarterly pacing on that, it\u2019s right where we would have expected. It\u2019s consistently growing there, so no changes. Brian Essex : Got it. And maybe I can sneak one last one in. Process for selling PlusServer, sounds like you\u2019re at the early stages, but I guess what gives you the confidence that you can get that done by the end of the year? Blake Irving : Yes, when we made this acquisition, we did a fair amount of diligence on that particular business, anticipating that we would divest of it. So we know the market. We know the natural buyers, and I\u2019ve had some preliminary discussions. So that\u2019s giving us some confidence that we\u2019ll be able to get it done. Brian Essex : Got it. Very helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney from RBC. Your line is open. Mark Mahaney, your line is open. Mark Mahaney : I\u2019m sorry, I muted myself. Thanks for all the color on the HEG integration impact on the P&L. That was very helpful. Two question please. I think you\u2019re going to give a non-answer, but there was a small acceleration in Biz Apps growth \u2013 revenue growth. Is that just kind of in the line of the normal? Or is there anything you\u2019d point to there? I know it was roughly in line with your guidance, but a little bit of acceleration. And then I think last quarter, you talked about potential rollout of security-oriented products in the back half of this year or in Q3. And I\u2019m sorry if you already talked about it, but talked about it, but if you could provide an update on that please. Thank you. Scott Wagner : Hey, Mark. It\u2019s Scott. The small acceleration in Biz Apps, nothing really to see there. It\u2019s just steady trajectory. So really, the uptick was more rounding than anything else. I will say we continue to be proud of and happy with the continued growth rate in Business Applications, which is turning into a really big segment right now. But don\u2019t read too much into the single quarter acceleration. And again going forward, just think about that broad category being 3 to 4 times the rate of customer \u2013 our customer growth. In terms of security services. We just closed on Sucuri, which is a really nice product portfolio. And we\u2019re going to be building up and probably rolling out some of those services in the second half of this year. Mark Mahaney : Thank you, Scott. Operator : Your next question comes from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Your line is open. Sterling Auty : Yes. Sorry for the wind noise. One quick question, in the domain business in the quarter and the growth you saw, can you comment about the aftermarket impacts on it this quarter? Scott Wagner : Hey, Sterling, it\u2019s Scott. Yes, again, if you look at the 10% growth rate for the quarter, our above call it the industry unit growth of 3% to 5%, there\u2019s three contributors to that. One is the fact that we continue to gain unit share in comm. And second is our continued international expansion in terms of ccTLDs and growth there. And then the third is the aftermarket. And if you parse those apart, it\u2019s roughly \u2013 they\u2019re all contributing. And they\u2019re not precisely a third, a third, a third, but it\u2019s kind of balanced across all three. Sterling Auty : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Sameet Sinha from B. Riley. Your line is open. Sameet Sinha : Yes. Thank you very much. A couple of questions. If you can talk about the refund rates. It seemed that as a percentage of revenue or bookings continues to come down year-over-year. Is there anything specific that you\u2019d put into place? It\u2019s been about 6 quarters that it\u2019s been coming down. And how much more do you think it will go down? Secondly, I saw some deleveraging in the marketing and advertising line. I guess it\u2019s the Super Bowl and the push behind GoCentral. How should we expect that trend through the year? Is that a line item that we expect to delever throughout the year? Scott Wagner : It\u2019s Scott. In terms of refund rates, thanks for pointing out that it has been declining over the last 6 quarters. That\u2019s just the natural result of building great products and great services and getting our customers into the product that they both want, need and is best for them. If you look at GoDaddy\u2019s refund practices and our approach relative to others in our industry and certainly in the technology world, we\u2019re really generous, and we bend over backwards to help out our customers. If they end up in the wrong thing, we bend over backwards the right product for what their need is. And that\u2019s a nice balance. It\u2019s a great place for us to be. And when you see a declining refund run rate like that, I think it\u2019s just reflective of us doing our job may be right upfront, getting customers into the right thing right up front. In terms of marketing and advertising. We\u2019re investing in marketing and advertising. But again, this is a business generator. And we look at our marketing spend on a lifetime value to cost of acquisition basis and in our developing markets like the United States, on a return on new revenue sold through existing customers. So going forward, you\u2019re going to want to think about marketing being roughly in line with revenue growth and in some cases, marketing might be a little faster than revenue growth, like in this quarter where we\u2019re going to ramp up new services like GoCentral or security services. And so it may tick up a little bit more, but we will definitely be getting leverage in other lines on the P&L particularly G&A and the infrastructure elements of tech and dev. Sameet Sinha : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from James Cakmak from Monness, Crespi, Hardt. Your line is open. James Cakmak, your line is open. James Cakmak : Hi, thanks. Just one question please. You guys have been really good about managing the leverage ratio, and as the cash balance is built. Can you just talk about how you think about the allocation of that cash? Obviously, you\u2019re going to be managing to your target ratios. But with all these irons in the fire with the different products, do you feel that there\u2019s more tuck-in opportunities? Or do you have the capability to absorb something maybe not as big as HEG, but something of some scale? Is that how you think about your cash in general right now with HEG closing? Ray Winborne : Yes, James. This is Ray. You see we closed the quarter out with almost $700 million in cash on the balance sheet. When you think about further M&A, always there are opportunities. The focus right now, we got the leverage at 4, coming down to 3 by the end of the year. But it\u2019s bringing this HEG business together with our European operations creating value for customers and generating the synergies that Scott talked about. I would look at the ability to do further M&A really in 2 buckets, one operational and one balance sheet capacity. When you take out operationally, we\u2019ve got a business system in place now that will enable that integration that we\u2019re doing, especially with HEG as we speak. Our products are API-able. We\u2019ve got a global tech platform. We\u2019ve got a scalable customer care system. From a leverage standpoint, again, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see anything the size of HEG for sure. But if the right opportunity comes along with a tech or a product type tuck-in, we\u2019ll have the capacity as we move the latter half of 2017. James Cakmak : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Naved Khan from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open. Naved Khan : Thanks very much. Just a couple. If I look at the ARPU, it was flat sequentially. I think this is the first time in a while that we have seen flat ARPU. Did you run any promotions that kind of affected this metric? Or is there another explanation for it? And then with respect to the SmartLine product, what\u2019s the timing in terms of the bigger launch? And what are your plans for spending marketing dollars behind it? Ray Winborne : Hey, Naved. It\u2019s Ray. On the flat sequential ARPU nothing to read into that. If you just look back at the quarterly pacing on ARPU for the last, call it, 4, 6 quarters, nothing is changed really in that trajectory. In fact, we just continue to balance customer growth and ARPU growth there. So you\u2019ll see slight bounces back and fourth, but again, as we would have expected, growing in that mid-single-digit range. Blake Irving : And Naved, this is Blake. On SmartLine, launch timing for the bigger launch, frankly, I talked about 3 sets of, features, both the vanity numbers, 800 numbers and SMS and MMS texting. You\u2019ll see those happen in the summer, last part of the summer. And that is likely when we actually go big with a launch and actually make a claim \u2013 we will be testing our way into that. I\u2019d characterize marketing spend on that as being I\u2019d call it pretty small and just kind of, again, testing our way into seeing what\u2019s working with our customer segments. And you\u2019re going to see some very interesting and unique in product marketing for that product as well. And one of the things we believe is that people shouldn\u2019t put a personal phone number on their website. So when we suspect somebody is doing that, we\u2019re going to surface a message that says, you know, you really ought to try the SmartLine product because you shouldn\u2019t put your personal phone number on a website for all to see. And those types of things, that kind of clever integration around the way that we can have products do marketing for us are things that we think are really frankly good leverage advantage for us. Naved Khan : That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Tom Davis from Summit Redstone Partners. Your line is open. Tom Davis : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my call. I just had a quick question here on FreedomVoice. Is that going to be rolled out internationally? Or is that going to be mainly just a U.S. product? Blake Irving : Hi, Tom this is Blake. FreedomVoice is of course responsible for the SmartLine product. But as you know, the regulatory environment in different countries differs pretty dramatically. So what we\u2019re going to do is we\u2019re going to basically introduce it in the United States, get very successful with it, make sure that we\u2019re happy with the results that we\u2019re seeing. And once we believe we\u2019ve kind of got that dialled in, and we have a product that we feel very confident, then we\u2019ll look at other markets outside the United States where we think the regulatory environment is friendly enough for us to enter. But I would not look at it as an international \u2013 as something we\u2019re going to blow out internationally. It\u2019s just a very different market country by country, but we\u2019re going to go pretty deep in the United States, and think we\u2019ve got a great opportunity. You always want to just kind of be step wise when you\u2019re doing things like this, whether you have the crawl, walk, run mentality. But I think you want to be pretty thoughtful on how you enter markets versus trying to do something that\u2019s a big blowout, especially when there\u2019s heterogeneous environments in different markets. And for telecom, there could be almost no market more heterogeneous. They are very, very different throughout the world. Tom Davis : And if I could have a quick follow-up question, just I know you guys hit on the free trials. Could you give any color on like the win rates, the conversion rate for free to paying? Blake Irving : Yes. I said a little earlier that free trials, since we\u2019re so early and we\u2019re doing so many tests on when we convert, what the timing on conversion is, how we post email to customers, that it\u2019s difficult for us to actually give any kind of indicator that would be worth publishing. Published rate\u2019s really good. That\u2019s indicative and we\u2019ve done in 40 countries only about 30 days, so we haven\u2019t seen that come in yet. But the number of published site has grown really nicely. We believe that our hypothesis is that publishers turn into conversion for a reasonable percentage of customers. And that new on-ramp and the attach of domains to that on-ramp, we\u2019re actually getting pretty interested in it. And it looks like the investment thesis was solid. So we\u2019ll keep \u2013 when we think we have enough information to actually start being able to dial it in, it might be worth sharing. But up till now, the changes and the tests that we\u2019re running that we\u2019re running are so extreme, it\u2019s really hard to get any indication from it. Tom Davis : All right. Thanks guys. Blake Irving : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark May from Citi. Your line is open. Mark May : Thanks for taking my questions. I had two if I could. Just looking, wondering if you could comment a little bit on the month-on-month trends in the business as you kind of worked your way through the quarter and into April. And then I think, Ray, you mentioned earlier I think domain revenue growth was around 10% in the quarter. And I think you mentioned that we should expect that to kind of trend towards customer growth, which was I think around7% in the quarter. Is that a good guidepost for how to think about the near-term Q2, just trying to get a sense of kind of year time frame there? Thanks. Ray Winborne : Yes, Mark it\u2019s Ray. So the month-over-month trends to the quarter really nothing unusual there. Again, year-over-year, we had to comp against leap year, which was affecting the numbers but on a sequential basis, nothing unusual to read out on. As far as Domains being 10%, what to expect, Scott said it well. The direction we\u2019ve given you guys over the long-term is that, roughly at approximation of customer growth. So you\u2019re not going to see it bounce around a lot. You\u2019re going to see a pretty smooth trend as we move throughout the year, plus or minus off that mark we\u2019re on today. Mark May : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan from Barclays. Your line is open. Deepak Mathivanan : Great, thanks. Two questions for me. So first, I know last year in 1Q, you took steps to move away from multiyear discounts in the hosting side that impacted bookings growth. Can you talk about whether there were any such initiatives in 1Q this year? And how should we think about the contract duration going forward? And then second on the HEG, you noted that $40 million contribution in 2Q. Can you give about the seasonality expectations for maybe the next few quarters as well? That would be helpful. Thanks a lot. Scott Wagner : Hey, it\u2019s Scott. Hey, Deepak, it\u2019s Scott. I\u2019ll do the first one, and then Ray can handle the second. Nothing of note in terms of merchandising tactics or differences to call out this quarter that really affected the P&L. And what that means from a contract duration standpoint is it was pretty stable. And I think there\u2019s nothing really all that different. I mean obviously, we keep trying different bundling, merchandising approaches. But in terms of you guys outside and nothing different both on merchandising and then contract duration. Ray Winborne : Hey, Deepak, it\u2019s Ray. Nothing seasonal about the HEG revenue stream. I gave you a point estimate for the second quarter of $40 million. The $100 million that will come in, in the back half of the year will ramp up slightly. So if you were going to try to into a model, take the $100 million remaining amount and spread that slightly lower in the third and a little higher in the fourth. Their bookings though, when you ask from a seasonality standpoint, not a lot of seasonality in their bookings. Deepak Mathivanan : Okay, that makes sense. Great, thanks Ray. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to the presenters. Blake Irving : Great. Well, thanks, everybody. Thanks for your questions. Thanks for listening. We look forward to talking with you in another few months at our second quarter earnings call. Have a great rest of week. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect.",

Riley Operator : Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Julie, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the GoDaddy Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Marta Nichols, VP of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference. Marta Nichols : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for GoDaddy's Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Call. With me today are Blake Irving, CEO; Scott Wagner, President and COO; and Ray Winborne, CFO. We'll share some prepared remarks, and then we'll open up the call for questions. On today's call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and operating metrics such as total bookings, unlevered free cash flow, net debt and ARPU. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents may be found in the presentation posted to our Investor Relations website at investors.godaddy.net, or on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC with today's earnings release. The matters we'll be discussing include forward-looking statements, which include those related to our future financial results; new product introductions; our ability to integrate recent or potential future acquisitions and achieve desired synergies, including our recent acquisition of HEG and the possible divestiture of HEG's PlusServer business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. And any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, August 8, 2017, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. Unless otherwise stated, when we refer to organic measures, we're referring to those measures excluding the impact of HEG. I'll now turn the call over to Blake. Blake Irving : Thanks, Marta, and thanks for joining us today to discuss our second quarter results. The second quarter was our first including Host Europe Group, HEG, and we're really pleased with the combined results. We're continuing to see steady growth in customers and ARPU, solid execution on our HEG integration plans as well as our product and marketing roadmap for 2017. And we've signed an agreement to divest PlusServer for an attractive price. In the second quarter, we've grown to serve nearly 17 million customers, up 2.6 million from a year ago, aided by the 1.6 million HEG customers we brought on this quarter. And with the combination of our multiyear organic international expansion and now the addition of HEG, the composition of our customer base has changed a lot. While we were primarily a U.S.-centric company when Scott and I came to GoDaddy over four years ago, now nearly 40% of our customers are in markets outside of the U.S. Our combined ARPU rose approximately 3% year-over-year in Q2 to $129, with HEG only contributing 1/4 of revenue to our annual measure, as we mentioned on our last call. GoDaddy's organic ARPU, excluding HEG, was $132, rising 6% year-over-year, similar to growth in our past quarters. Our growth strategy in 2017 remains consistent with what we've done over the last several years. We're focused on continued double-digit top line growth fueled by : first, organic customer adds; and second, expanding our ARPU. With the HEG acquisition, we have many more opportunities to do both. And we're making continued progress on our 2017 product and strategic initiatives including : one, growing penetration of GoCentral, our entirely new mobile-optimized website builder; two, bringing new security offerings to market on the heels of the Sucuri acquisition; three, launching our new telephony offering, SmartLine; and four, as I just discussed, our HEG integration. I'll spend a little time on our product progress including GoCentral Security and SmartLine. And then, I'm going to turn the call over to Scott to discuss HEG, and Ray for our financials. On GoCentral, we're very pleased with the progress across many measures, including website publish rates, international sign-ups, paid conversion, a rapid pace of iteration on product and marketing and, most importantly, on customer reviews. Let me hit each one of those briefly. First, on publish rates. Since our late 2016 launch, the number of websites published using GoCentral continues to march steadily upwards, with hundreds of thousands of websites now published. Every one of these sites can be edited and managed entirely from a mobile device or a PC and is mobile-optimized on both performance and conversion for customers. And well over half of those new sites are being published within one hour of when the customer signs up, one hour. Now that's just wicked fast. Second, on GoCentral usage. Since we launched dozens of international markets at the end of March, customer sign-ups in markets outside of the U.S. now account for half of all new GoCentral sign-ups. Our thesis about having an entirely end-to-end mobile website builder is really proving out in international markets. Third, on paid conversion. We've been thrilled to see conversion from free trials to paid subscriptions moving up quickly. Around the world, we've seen a mid-single-digit conversion rate from free trials to paid subscriptions. The improvements we've been driving in publishing conversion rates since launch are coming from a wide range of factors that we're working on in parallel, from feature improvements in the product, to better merchandising on our sites and purchase flows, to increasing sophistication in our marketing and communication with customers. Which brings me to my fourth point on our product and merchandising work. We're continuing to improve the customer experience with everything from new GoCentral features to purchase path improvements. Just in the last few months, GoCentral customers can now sync content with Facebook; easily integrate with Google AdSense; add audio or video features; choose from hundreds of new themes, fonts, photos and layout options; and better merchandise their e-commerce inventory. We're also engaging customers at more points along the purchase path. We're now successfully funneling domain purchasers to GoCentral free trials, and we're directing customers who publish sites to our new domain suggestion engine, which is actually making Domains an attached product. And we're now offering more choice on payment plan terms from annual to monthly. And fifth, the reviews of GoCentral thus far have been outstanding, with nearly 80% of the ratings at 4 or 5 stars. The two big wins are in ease of use and the exceptional support we provide. Many people assume that a DIY website builder leaves them entirely on their own, and when they discover they can get knowledgeable and consultative support from GoDaddy, they absolutely love it. We provided a couple of direct customer quotes in the earnings slides that reflect customer sentiment. Now while we love to hear positive feedback of how we're helping customers succeed, we consider the negative feedback even more important. It tells us precisely where we need to improve. Where GoCentral isn't 5 stars, the feedback is largely about wanting GoCentral to do more, more features, functionality and flexibility. And this is exactly what we expected and planned for. And the modularity we built into the platform is allowing us to run really fast at product improvement. We have dozens of feature enhancements on the near-term roadmap, from expanded and deepened verticals to better UI, to much more social sharing, language translation, integration with Google Analytics and OpenTable and more, and while maintaining our exceptional ease of use. Zooming out, I think, the meta point here is that our roadmap will move GoCentral from where it is today, an exceedingly easy website creation product for our customers to something that can auto-render across thousands of verticals from photographers to homebuilders, allow flexibility around design and features, and put content everywhere it needs to be, in social, search and more, without sacrificing ease of use. Look, it's still early, but the velocity in the results are positive and we're gaining momentum. So beyond GoCentral, we're also now offering security products from our recent Sucuri acquisition to our customers. In fact, speaking of velocity, we had our new security offerings in the market within 60 days of the acquisition. That's a testament to the quality of the product and the quality of the product teams. We're now providing website owners with tools to scan their sites, respond to hacks when they occur, patch vulnerabilities and more. And Sucuri is a leader in security management of WordPress websites, which is an important growth area in our hosting business. Turning to SmartLine, we've seen thousands of sign-ups for our soft launch, which is available at godaddy.com/smartline. SmartLine is built on the technology from our FreedomVoice acquisition and allows our customers to add a second and completely separate phone line to an existing iOS or Android phone for as little as $4 a month. We'll add SMS and MMS texting in the next couple of weeks, with 800 numbers, customized Daddy numbers and more coming next. We'll begin to ramp up our marketing spend behind SmartLine this fall as we hone our messaging and our tactics. So we're making great strides on our product roadmap this year with GoCentral, security and SmartLine. And we feel very good about our goals for 2017 and beyond. And with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Scott to talk a bit more about our international footprint, particularly the integration of HEG. Scott? Scott Wagner : Thanks Blake. As Blake mentioned, our HEG integration continues to go really well. Our combined company now manages 72 million domains globally and serves nearly 17 million customers around the world. Those are big numbers. When we told everyone when we announced the acquisition that we expected $20 million in annualized revenue and cost synergies by the end of next year, and we're making really good progress towards our targets. We hit the ground running immediately after we closed HEG in early Q2, integrating GoDaddy's SSL certificates and domain aftermarket experiences into the company's heritage brand such as 123 Reg and DomainFactory. Going forward, we have a number of integration efforts running in parallel, and I'll touch on just a couple. First, we're focused on the merchandising experience across HEG's heritage brands. For example, we're testing the results of product and purchase flows on HEG's sites, comparing them to GoDaddy's and implementing what performs best for customers and for us. We're also taking our industry-leading domain search capabilities and implementing them throughout HEG's brands. As a result, we expect to match more domain name searches, providing value to our customers and better business for us. Second, we're in the process of building an integrated European customer care operation with A+ support and consultative sales. We've already deployed a number of our care leaders to the heritage HEG teams in Europe and are seeing good results. Recall that GoDaddy today generates nearly 1/4 of our bookings from customer care, while HEG's percentage is lower. Helping their care teams learn how to engage empathetically with customers, identify specific needs and match those needs to our offering holds a lot of opportunity for our new European customers and also for GoDaddy. And third, we're preparing to introduce more GoDaddy products to HEG customers, including our Managed WordPress offerings, GoCentral, Office 365 and more, which we'll roll out to European markets over the next several quarters. There's also background work being done to optimize pricing and returns on our marketing spend, align procurement and contracts, rationalize facilities and more. I have to say that with everything that we're doing, we're particularly pleased with the alignment across our teams, with several leaders from GoDaddy U.S. and the former HEG, now GoDaddy EMEA, working in really seamless collaboration towards the goal of establishing a single European business. So that's a quick update on HEG. I'm going to hand it over to Ray now to cover the financial picture, including our Q2 results and our full year outlook. Ray? Raymond Winborne : Thanks, Scott. In Q2, we continued to execute well on all fronts, with a strong product roadmap, solid financial results and new opportunities to leverage the business model with HEG. On a consolidated basis, revenue grew 22% to $558 million, and bookings grew 24% to $668 million. On an organic basis, GoDaddy grew 12%, in line with our expectations, while HEG contributed $46 million in the quarter, a bit higher than our guidance, driven by the completion of the preliminary purchase price allocation. Customers grew nearly 18% with the addition of 1.6 million customers from HEG. Organically, GoDaddy's customer growth was about 7%, in line with our recent trends. Consolidated ARPU came in at $129, up roughly 3% year-over-year. As we highlighted last quarter, that growth rate is a little lower than recent trends due to the inclusion of only one quarter of revenue from HEG in what is an annual calculation. GoDaddy's organic ARPU growth was approximately 6% following a similar mid-single-digit growth trajectory in the recent quarters. Briefly on our three product revenue lines. Domains revenue grew approximately 15% year-over-year in Q2. The majority of the growth was organic, driven by international, strong renewals and aftermarket domain sales, with the remainder attributable to the addition of HEG. We continue to look for organic revenue growth in our Domains business to move towards our customer growth rate over the medium to long-term. Hosting and Presence revenue increased over 28% versus Q2 a year ago, with the majority of the incremental revenue coming from HEG. Organic growth was in the low double digits, similar to Q1, and also in line with our expected longer-term growth of roughly 1x to 2x our customer growth rate. Business applications revenue grew 35% in Q2, driven by our growing product suite and customer base, along with a small contribution from the addition of HEG. International revenue grew 57% year-over-year or 61% on a constant currency basis. Beyond the addition of HEG, GoDaddy's organic business continued to grow nicely in the high teens. International is now at roughly a $750 million revenue run rate with significant scale on its own. We continue to believe international expansion will be a key growth driver in years to come, given our global footprint, horizontal need of our products, the strength of the GoDaddy brand and value proposition and the contribution from HEG. Turning to cash generation. Unlevered free cash flow grew 61% in Q2 to $135 million. Unlevered free cash flow growth was boosted both by the HEG acquisition and the favorable impact of a shift in pay periods versus last year, which we mentioned on our last call. GoDaddy's organic year-over-year growth in unlevered free cash flow for the first half of 2017 was over 20%, continuing our recent trajectory. Looking at expenses, other than higher amortization related to the purchase accounting, the inclusion of HEG didn't have a perceptible impact on expense as a percentage of revenue for the combined company. Gross margin ticked up sequentially. And for modeling purposes, we'd recommend holding it more or less in line with Q2 going forward. I'll point out, G&A this quarter includes nearly $14 million in costs associated with closing the HEG transaction and the incremental costs incurred as we integrate operations. The takeaway is that we're getting operating leverage and we're seeing continued margin expansion year-over-year. One other item of note for the quarter is the TRA benefit below the operating line. This liability moves every quarter based off several factors. However, you'll note that the adjustment is larger than usual, due both to the secondary offering that occurred in May, and a recent favorable tax ruling. As a reminder, adjustments to the TRA liability are noncash items. Turning to the balance sheet. We finished Q2 with approximately $591 million in cash and short-term investments, and net debt of $2.5 billion. We bought back $275 million in stock in early May, alongside a secondary offering by our four large holders, which we viewed as a cost-effective mechanism to accretively reduce our share count by approximately 7.3 million, without reducing our public float. And finally, we reached an agreement to divest PlusServer at an enterprise value of EUR 397 million. After transaction fees and taxes, we'll net approximately EUR 350 million. The transaction is expected to close in the next month or so, and we'll use the net proceeds and cash on hand to pay off the EUR 500 million bridge loan. You'll see a pro forma net debt calculation in the back of the press release, reflecting the anticipated sale of PlusServer and paydown of the bridge loan. The divestiture of PlusServer, combined with expected cash flow growth this year, is expected to bring our leverage ratio down to near the midpoint of our target range of 2x to 4x by the end of 2017. Our long-term focus remains on driving strong and consistent cash flow. As our cash flow and balance sheet capacity expands, and consistent with our stock repurchase earlier this year, you will continue to see us be thoughtful stewards of capital, with the ultimate goal of prudently driving attractive growth in levered free cash flow per share for our owners. So let's discuss our outlook for Q3 and the full year. Note that this outlook includes no contribution for PlusServer. For both revenue and unlevered free cash flow, we're tightening our full year ranges and raising the midpoints. For Q3, we expect revenue in the range of $577 million to $582 million. For the full year 2017, our revenue range is $2.215 billion to $2.225 billion. As I mentioned earlier, we completed the preliminary purchase price allocation for HEG and now expect its full year 2017 revenue contribution to be approximately $150 million. This number reflects purchase accounting adjustment and leaves $104 million to be recognized over the back half of the year. For the full year, we expect unlevered free cash flow for the combined company of $475 million to $485 million, implying 35% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Consistent with past practice, our cash flow outlook excludes expected acquisition and integration costs. Taking a step back, our first half results and our full year outlook should paint a familiar picture for you. We've included HEG for the first time, but the takeaway is that nothing in our story has fundamentally changed. We feel good about the progress of GoCentral, security, SmartLine and other product initiatives. We feel good about the trajectory of the HEG integration and we feel good about our operational and financial execution. And we're focused on leveraging our brand and scale to extend our global competitive advantages, growing our customers' ARPU and top line and delivering strong unlevered free cash flow in margin expansion over time. Finally, we remain confident the business can generate unlevered free cash flow of $600 million next year. So with that, I'll turn the call back to Blake. Blake? Blake Irving : Thanks Ray. As Ray said, we're continuing to deliver on our strategy and financial expectations and we see a very big global opportunity to keep growing the business for many years to come. We thank you, as always, for your time. And we're ready to open the call to your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Sam Kemp with Piper Jaffray. Samuel Kemp : Ray, thanks for all the disclosures around HEG. Maybe I can eke out a couple more. Can you talk about how much HEG contributed to bookings and unlevered free cash flow during the quarter? And then, Blake, you talked a lot about GoCentral. Can you talk about where those customers are coming from? Are those customers that have previously been part of the GoDaddy customer base that are now upselling themselves into GoCentral? Or are you finding that you're actually acquiring customers at a substantial rate using GoCentral as the actual on-ramp? Blake Irving : I will let Ray take the first question, then I'll follow up, Sam. Raymond Winborne : Sam, it's Ray. Effective with the close of the transaction, we're running these businesses together now under the GoDaddy EMEA banner. And so the decisions we're making are to get the best out of both of these businesses, so it's blurring the lines of separation. So you'll see we provided you with some of the key metrics, but we're not going to get down into the details of every revenue and expense line item because, frankly, it's just an exercise in precision without accuracy. But to give you a little insight into bookings, when we closed the transaction last year, we highlighted that their annualized bookings in '16 were 240 million. So if you look at the growth in that context, you'll see that the GoDaddy range is in that 12% to 13%. And GoDaddy did about 12% in the first quarter as well. And same commentary around unlevered free cash flow, not breaking up the specifics between the two businesses because of the intermingled operations. But bigger picture and stepping back there, we've guided unlevered free cash flow to $480 million at the midpoint 2017 and growing that to $600 million in 2018. So that 20% growth algorithm that we've been discussing on past calls continues to be our target. Hopefully, that helps you out a little bit with looking underneath the covers there. Blake Irving : So we actually are really pleased with the hypothesis, which was if we added a new on-ramp for folks that were not GoDaddy customers, that they would start coming into the franchise. So we're using GoCentral as this new on-ramp, and it's working. You heard me mention in the comments that we actually are seeing Domains become an attach product for GoCentral customers, which is something we're doing with some really nice algorithmic suggestions on what a customer should do based on what they've actually entered into their website. We're not going to split between how many are new versus GoDaddy customers, but we're absolutely attracting new customers with GoCentral who have not been in the GoDaddy franchise before, and we're quite pleased about that. Operator : Your next question comes from Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Shweta Khajuria : This is Shweta for Ron. Could you talk a little bit about SmartLine, a little more detail on your marketing plans and early traction on the product? You've mentioned you will be introducing texts and MMS and 800 numbers as well. So really, anything that you could add on that, that would be great. Blake Irving : Sure. So this is Blake. So SmartLine, you'll start seeing us start actually marketing at top of funnel in the fall. We have certainly thousands of them in the hands of users, have just introduced texting actually to the users that have the SmartLine capability today. You'll see that rollout in the next couple of weeks more broadly. And I think that the two features that I mentioned, one was 800 numbers that will come out in the remaining of the year, calendar year, and vanity numbers that are numbers that feel like they are the same name as your website, and we intend to do some pretty interesting bundling between, frankly, GoCentral Mail and SmartLine, so you can have a full business package between having a website, a professional e-mail and a professional phone number that will be - that will make you feel like you are in business and have all the advantages of a large business. We're pretty darn happy with it, and the installation and the usage is steadily climbing. Scott Wagner : And when you talk about marketing spend, the promise of SmartLine is a broad one when you think about being able to get full functionality of a phone for a couple bucks a month and a second line. And so from a go-to-market standpoint, as these features come online, we're going to start to test marketing spend all around the LTV to CAC economics and see what kind of spend, what channels in messaging works, and we'll go from there. Operator : Your next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan with Barclays. Deepak Mathivanan : First question on GoCentral, the mid-single-digit conversion you noted from free to pay is pretty strong. Can you talk about a bit on the trajectory of the product that you've seen over the last few months? Has it been consistent? And when should we overall expect GoCentral to become a material contributor to revenues or revenue growth on the hosting segment? And then, Ray, it seems like purchase accounting impact was lower in 2Q. So does that mean it's going to slightly be higher than your expectations in 3Q and 4Q? What sounded like the contribution on - from Host Europe in the 3Q guidance, I know you raised the full year expectation to $150 million. Blake Irving : Deepak, this is Blake. So on GoCentral, we're seeing, I'll call it, mid-single-digit conversion, and I'd say, over the last couple of quarters when we introduced the product, we've seen a steadily increasing conversion rate. As we've dialed in sort of the purchase path flows and actually letting people get access to the product and making it just frankly easier and easier to build a website. So we're seeing folks quite pleased with the tool, with the results the tool creates. And then, they start converting. You got to think of this business though, I think, in terms of contribution. Remember, this is a lot of our revenues, as you know, are already in the franchise because we're a renewal business. And so until we start rounding, I think, some of these new GoCentral users into renewals, we're not going to see I think a substantial contribution to the hosting line. Certainly, it's going to grow, but if you think about hundreds of thousands of customers at 5% - hundreds of thousands of publishes at 5% conversion, you can kind of just do the math from there. And I think that we'll continue to see that grow and start lapping itself in terms of subscription services. Raymond Winborne : Deepak, just to tack on, this is Ray, to tack on to Blake's point, if you look at that Hosting and Presence line now, it's an $800 million-plus annualized revenue line item. So it's going to take a decent number to start moving the meter there. On your question around purchase accounting, obviously completed the preliminary allocation. The numbers came in a little better than what we had guided to the Street last quarter. And I wanted, because of the confusion around that haircut in the deferred revenue, we wanted to give you guys a point estimate for the year. So it's $150 million, up from $140 million last quarter. We've recognized $46 million. So as you look at the third quarter guide and then the implied fourth quarter as we give the full year guidance, you'll see that tick up. Now one thing to note if you look back at historical GoDaddy, the haircut and the purchase accounting impact is not as extreme. It happens mostly upfront in HEG getting their shorter term on their customers. So hopefully, that helps you out. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Jason Helfstein : A few questions. So just I want to understand the logic of putting Presence with Hosting as the way you report it. Why not put Presence in business application? The second question, the 28% growth in Hosting and Presence, if you back out HEG, would it have had an impact on that? So kind of perhaps you can give us like a pro forma growth for that? And then, lastly, when you're thinking about the conversion opportunity in presence, how are you thinking about that? Because Scott, to your point - or I guess, the point on when the renewals come in, that's really when you have the opportunity to try to kind of then sell that feature, upsell that feature. And just how are you thinking about it longer term? Is there any kind of numbers you want to share? Blake Irving : Jason, this is Blake. I'll cover one, let Ray cover 2, and then, Scott will cover 3. Look, the logic of putting Hosting and Presence together is they're both websites. When somebody wants to put a presence on the Web with a URL, they want to be found, right? You're either going to do a DIY website builder, you're going to hire a professional to build a website for you, or you have advanced skills and you're going to build it yourself. And remember that more than 50% of websites today are built by a professional, not built by a business owner themselves. So we look at that hosting business, whether it's being built by a professional or an advanced user or somebody using a DIY website builder as being, frankly, elastic, they're going to make a choice on whether they're going to use a simple DIY website builder, have somebody build it, or advanced enough to go use a more advanced hosting product, and that's why we put those things together. Raymond Winborne : Jason, it's Ray. On your HEG question specifically around Hosting and Presence, give you a little context on HEG's impacts on the different product lines. Very rough split. HEG is about 30% Domains, 60% Hosting and Presence, and 10% biz apps. If you apply those ratios to the $46 million in revenue that we put in this quarter, that will give you a good sense of what it contributed. But the GoDaddy Hosting and Presence is still growing at double digits, very similar to first quarter rates. Scott Wagner : Jason, help me out on the last question, just around conversion on GoCentral or SmartLine. I just want to make sure that I'm able to answer your - answer it accurately. Jason Helfstein : Sure. So I guess, the point is as customers go to renew their plan, their hosting subscription, that will be your opportunity to try to effectively offer them GoCentral to existing customers. I mean, is that kind of the idea? And just any anecdotal on where you think conversion rates could go with that business over time? Scott Wagner : So part of the renewal, Blake's renewal comment is this is just - it's a renewal business. And so right now, we're getting new builds from both - new builds from existing customers and attracting new customers to the franchise. But new by itself on top of a big renewal base, it's just tough to move sort of a P&L needle. And so the focus is get new builds, again, new customers and even with their existing customers, and as those new builds flow into renewal cycle, add, frankly, the conversion rates and the resonance that we're seeing with customers, that should produce a positive lift to renewals and you're getting the flywheel going of more new coming into a renewal base. So the focus on the product is still get a new idea, and whether it's to a new customer or an existing - or a new idea from an existing customer or a new one. Now over time, there are interesting ways that we can think about and play with conversion of old sites into the new content platform, but that's maybe down the road. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Brian Essex : Blake, I just want to maybe comment that we met with a company in your space that's trying to hit you as a benchmark for their customer care, and they noted how difficult performing up to your standards are. Given that backdrop, how much progress have you made at HEG? And what are the barriers that you see towards getting their customer care business up to your standards? How quickly might we expect that to have an impact on their platform? Blake Irving : Brian, I'm going to hand that question over to Scott because he's been intimately involved in the HEG integration. Scott, you want to handle that one? Scott Wagner : Yes, please. We're really pleased with the progress we, and it's now the collective EMEA team that made creating a single care operation. I'll tell you, one of the things that we were excited about the HEG business was the commitment to care, particularly as a support mode. So the business in the European operations of HEG had a similar ethos around support and had been trying and experimenting with, again, intelligent next product additions, all, again, support turning into sales, which is really the method that we've been operating in and perfected over 20 years. And so what's nice is it's actually been pretty easy to describe the model that we're trying to get to and then build it up in Europe. And obviously, when you're dealing with hundreds of agents and reps in different calls, if that's not a snap your fingers business practice and then it rolls out. But we feel really good about the practice of A+ quality support and being able to translate that into a revenue event and being able to have an operation that's going to operate at that way very well in early 2018 in Europe. Brian Essex : Maybe I can follow-up with a question on Office 365, I know penetration was pretty light in HEG. Now that you've been in there for a couple of months, any traction there? And can we infer anything from that traction onto the growth of that business for the rest of the year? Blake Irving : You want to cover that, Scott, or do you want me? Scott Wagner : Sorry, I figured I'd just - it's O365, I'll take it. The reinforcement of productivity and branded e-mail as a value proposition that certainly extends into Europe is strong. I'm not sure there's any immediate thing that we'd call out in the results relative to O365, other than the confidence that when we add a fantastic simple onboarding experience, plus the ability to migrate from an older e-mail system, whatever it might look like, into a branded both e-mail and productivity suite, that the value proposition is just a superstrong one. Raymond Winborne : Yes, just to pile on to Scott's comment, Brian, one of the things we did with Office 365 when we introduced it into our own GoDaddy customers a few years ago was we've modified the installation process to go from 22 individual screens down to 1, with a lot of deep programmatic capability on the back end that made it super simple for somebody to get exactly the name they wanted on one of the domains that they owned. And we will absolutely do the exact same thing at HEG to make it just a wonderful product experience. So you'll see the same kind of traction that we've had in our franchise at HEG, but we're going to make sure that we offer the exact same quality level from an experience and customer delight perspective that we've done at GoDaddy, which has given us that nice lift that we've had in that business. Operator : Your next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Ugam Kamat : This is Ugam Kamat on for Sterling Auty. Firstly, I just wanted to look at the pro forma income statement. And I was wondering how much did the PlusServer business contribute to the revenue and the EPS? And secondly, on the international front, can you break it down by geographies? How are you seeing the demand, particularly in Asia Pacific? Blake Irving : Sorry, I missed the first part. How much did PlusServer contribute? Or did you say HEG? Ugam Kamat : PlusServer. Because you told the business\u2026 Blake Irving : Yes, so the PlusServer, when you see it in the P&L, it's being treated as a discontinued operation. So it won't show up in the revenue or the expense. It's on its own line item. And it's a very - relatively small contribution this quarter. So... Ugam Kamat : And on the international front, how are you seeing the demand with respect to Europe versus Asia? And what do you feel can be the demand drivers moving ahead? Scott Wagner : As we've talked about in past calls, we have a global business. We have operations in Asia and in Europe. Obviously, now, combined with HEG, we're getting to be a pretty big size in Europe. In Asia, our markets - India, which we've talked about in the past, is a very big and growing market. And then, an effort over the last year has been to pick up our investment effort in several of the countries, both around China and outside in Chinese Mandarin language. And that's going well. Obviously, we're starting from a smaller base. And I think, we had quantified that in past calls on the size of the Asia base, but we continue to see nice growth as we build up our businesses there. I think the important point is, again, the need state that we serve is a pretty horizontal one around the world, which is customers getting an idea, not only up and running online, but having it grow and thrive, both with front office and back office solutions. And what we're building is a global platform to be able to serve that need state around the world. Operator : Your next question comes from Jonathan Kees with Summit Redstone. Jonathan Kees : I wanted to ask about two things. One, the marketing and advertising for the quarter, it grew less than I had modeled - what I would expect. So interested in you've talked about marketing and advertising kind of growing with revenue there. I would think that with rebranding from HEG to GoDaddy EMEA and other marketing efforts that you're launching there, they would have been a lot higher, just a little color there. And then, second thing I wanted to ask is you've done a good job in terms of talking about the conversion from the customer care perspective, turning that into a sales experience and how that's higher than HEG. Just curious, from the customer retention perspective, how you compare it to HEG and if that's improved with HEG? Scott Wagner : Yes, Jonathan, it's Scott. So first on the marketing and advertising and marketing side, we've always - we've talked about it growing in line with revenue. And if you go backwards over time with us, you'll see in some quarters, it's a little lower in revenue and sometimes it's a little more. And I'd tell you to not hone in on any particular quarter, but that trending roughly in line with revenue is still the right long-term trajectory. Remember, when we think about our advertising and our marketing lines, we're really using these on an LTV to CAC basis. And going into either geographies or particularly product lines, looking for ways and continuing to grow around the world while maintaining what are pretty nice lifetime value to CAC returns on economics. And so when we think about our marketing spend, it's really around those metrics and not necessarily sort of what it looks like in any particular quarter. In terms of your second question on care and retention, remember, at the acquisition, we shared that HEG's retention was actually really, really strong. Now on a customer level, remember, customer, GoDaddy is at about 85% customer retention on an annual core level. HEG was actually at about 88%. Again, those brands underneath HEG offer a great experience and higher retention. It was a big part of that business model and why we felt really good about bringing those businesses in. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark May with Citigroup. Unidentified Analyst : This is [Kinder Alan] for Mark. Just 2, one on customers. I believe you guys disclosed that you had over 1.7 million customers for HEG at the start of the second quarter, and then reported this quarter that it was 1.6 million. Can you discuss what caused that decline in HEG customers throughout the quarter? And then, one on GoCentral conversion, you talked about it being in the mid-single digits. Can you compare how that compares with free trials run for other products that you have? Raymond Winborne : Ken, it's Ray. I'll take your first question. It wasn't necessarily a decline in the quarter. Obviously, as we closed the acquisition, we brought all the receipt-level detail, all their key metrics into GoDaddy and aligned those metrics to our definitions. So that changed the number that we had said before to where it landed. It's really removing the duplicates across the brands. So that's just a definitional alignment. Scott Wagner : Yes, it's Scott. In terms of the conversion from free trial, solid. Again, if you look not only at our products but others using that sort of model, mid-single digit conversion tends to be a pretty good number. So we feel good about where it is now. And obviously, we're going to keep trying to work that as we go in the quarters ahead. Operator : Your next question comes from James Cakmak with Monness, Crespi, Hardt. James Cakmak : Ray, you had mentioned kind of the outlook on the gross margin line to kind of think about it in terms of 2Q, and previously, that's been deleveraging some, I think, more attributable to the growth in Domains. So I guess, as we look forward, given the higher concentration of Hosting and Presence at HEG and some of these newer products, is that something that we can see aligning that we can start to see leverage from when we look forward? And then, I have a follow-up. Raymond Winborne : Yes. So as you look at the leverage we got this quarter, we're fairly small year-over-year. HEG is helping with that a little bit with just given the size of their hosting business and how much more they're levered there. But I think, I'm going to stick to the same script that we guys have been telling - we've been telling you guys over the past 6, 8 quarters. You're going to see that number move over time. As we hit more of the higher growth products with higher margins, you should see that increase. But for modeling purposes, I want you to keep it steady. Because as we add more products in, we want the flexibility to put them either buy, build or partner. And depending on that decision, that's going to drive a different P&L perspective. So we're, like we always have, we're managing to the adjusted EBITDA margin. So where it lines in the P&L is based off of those decisions. James Cakmak : Steady it is. And then, Blake, I think, you had mentioned that Domains are starting to become an attached product with GoCentral. Just before, Domains were the hook. Obviously, these new products are going to be the newest drivers for you, but how should we just think about Domains in general? I mean, is this just going to become a secondary attach component? Or do you still expect that to be kind of an engine for you guys because you still had all the gTLDs and whatnot. Blake Irving : Yes, James, Domains is still going to be a very big - our biggest by far engine of attach. So folks, generally, the pattern is, I have an idea, I'm going to name it. That is still largely the way most people get online today. There's other paths and on-ramp that's happened over the last few years where, I'm going to go play with the tools, see if I can stand up and get a website and name it, is something that is happening not at the same volume, but it's certainly happening across the industry. And what we have seen is because we have as much expertise as we do in Domains to use our algorithms to help somebody find exactly what they want, once they have built a website and we can actually look at all the text that they've entered in that website, what category of business they've chosen, what they've named their business, we can actually just suggest domains from the information they've already provided us without them ever having to search for a domain. So we can put up four or five suggestions that are very close to what they had in their mind when they started creating their website. And it's become a pretty powerful attach mechanism for us. We still think that Domains will be the giant hook that people use mentally when they say, \"I've got an idea and I want to name it.\" But we know that this is going to be an important on-ramp for us going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Matthew Diamond : This is actually Matt Diamond on Lloyd's behalf. It sounds like everything with GoCentral is going pretty well to start off. But I'm curious, have you seen any particular verticals where it's ramping notably higher than the corporate average and where your optimism is especially strong? Blake Irving : This is Blake, Matt. We're actually seeing verticals that are sort of what you'd expect, restaurants, real estate, photography, and I won't go through the list. We've got 16 that we think are the big hitters. And what we're seeing is that we're seeing behavior of those individuals and knowing exactly what they are doing. And then, we can take the product and start tailoring it to what we're seeing user behavior when - in the creation process. So adding capability that we know that these folks are interested in. We're scanning any kind of feedback where we're missing something that they think would be perfect for their site and then addressing those. And you'll start seeing us start lifting features and start lifting those broad categories, plus subcategories underneath those broad categories. If I use restaurants as an example, there are many categories underneath restaurants by type of restaurant that are also important. And imagery, and menu items, et cetera, start to change as well as whether it becomes a takeout business or not. So there are some really interesting things that we're getting signal on from folks that are using the product today and who are using that signal to tailor the product going forward. Matthew Diamond : And with the modularity that you're adding to GoCentral, I'm curious, is there any ramifications for OpEx in the second half? Or is there still some leverage to be seen there? Blake Irving : No, it's all leverage. Like the really - let me just explain the framework. So the way that we've built the product is incredibly programmatic. So if you think about if you play with GoCentral, you have right rail editing tools that allow you to make changes to the site. If I use a wedding site as an example, all we have to do is - to make that a wedding-specific product is make sure that we have the editing tools named in a way that somebody building a wedding site would think of it. So if they had a guest list or they had an invite list and they wanted to have a registry gift area, we just change the names in a file that is super simple and programmable. That makes it very easy for us. So we've got a ton of leverage out of the product without having to spend a lot more into it to produce a vertical. So that was the premise and the hypothesis of going super simple and horizontal to start with, and then building vertical depth on top of that capability. Matthew Diamond : Makes a ton of sense. Last one for me, how should we think about customers on Website Builder 7 in GoCentral? Is the idea to eventually migrate them over to the latter? Or will the Website Builder and GoCentral be run as two separate assets? Blake Irving : Well, I mean, ultimately, we would like folks that are on Website Builder 7 to migrate to GoCentral. We're not going to force a migration for people because it's an unpleasant experience when that happens. But picking up all the features, and one of the things I'll say is GoCentral had a deeper - sorry, Website Builder 7 had a deeper feature set that was not modular and was not - we would not gain operational capability with that product. So as we add more and more critical capability, we'll start seeing people migrate across from Website Builder 7 over to GoCentral. But again, we're not going to force that migration. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from Sameet Sinha with B. Riley. Lee Krowl : This is actually Lee Krowl filling in for Sameet. Just two relatively simple ones, first on GoCentral. Kind of curious as to kind of the user base as they adopt. Are they first-time users to kind of domains and websites? Or do you feel like you're having a competitive displacement from some of your peers? And then, secondly, just on the full year for HEG, what's baked into that in terms of cross-sell of existing GoDaddy products? Blake Irving : Yes. Lee, this is Blake. I'll answer the first one, and then I'll hand it over to Ray. So we are seeing folks that are showing up that are new to our franchise that are considering building a website first. They can do that with us. They can do that with other competitors. And what we've got a pretty interesting set of on-ramps for somebody who's going to build a website. We have a WordPress on-ramp that is much more complex, that allows unbelievable extensibility and flexibility and, frankly, has more development capability for folks that are pros and developers. And then, this new cohort that we're seeing show up in our customer base are folks that are saying, \"I really don't know anything technically. I just want to build something super simple. Please make it easier than PowerPoint.\" And these are folks new to the franchise that are showing up, that are playing with the tool, trying it out, publishing sites and then activating them against a domain name. And that is a new cohort for us. And frankly, we've even seen folks that are displaced, and this actually happens quite often, where somebody will have a website developer build the site for them, the website developer gets a full-time job because they were a freelancer, and they kind of disappear, and now, they're left in the lurch. And so what we've seen happen are folks that are actually rebuilding websites that they've had before with a developer who's no longer there and being happier with the results of this new website. And this is somebody who may not have been a customer of ours. And then, coming in and building one from scratch and being happier with the results than they were with a Web pro site that was built for them. So there's actually a dog rescue business. It's highlighted on one of our earnings slides that you can go check out to get a flavor for that. And I'll pass it over to Ray on HEG. Raymond Winborne : Yes. Lee, as far as what's baked into that full year guide on $150 million in revenue, it's the current product set that we've got to put in place, as Scott mentioned, SSL certificates and domain aftermarket experiences as well as the pipeline that we've got coming along of WordPress offerings, GoCentral, eventually O365. A lot of that is moving into next year though. So you won't see a lot of uplift this year from that product integration because it's being done over time. Blake Irving : Well, it looks like that's the last question, everybody. So I'd like to thank all of you for spending time with us on our second quarter earnings call. And yes, Marta, I was just told, tell everybody it's your birthday. There's no better way to spend a birthday than doing an earnings call. So thanks, everybody. And we look forward to talking to you in the third quarter. Bye now. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

We continued to deliver steady growth in the third quarter across all measures including bookings, revenue, customers, and ARPU. And we're making continued progress on our 2017 product and strategic initiatives including : one, growing penetration of GoCentral and continued rapid development of new futures; two, growing adoption of our new telephony offering, SmartLine; three, our HEG integration and international expansion; and four, the early release of our new Pro Managed WordPress offering. I'd like to share some quick details on our newest Pro WordPress offering for professional web developers and then Scott and Ray will update you on other initiatives and our results. Today over 50% of small business Websites globally are still built by professional web developers. WordPress is the most widely used content management system employed by professional web developers today. And we are the world's largest WordPress host with millions of WordPress sites around the world hosted by GoDaddy. The early release of our new word-processing platform bundles together high performance and highly reliable hosting with end-to-end security and the essential tools necessary to efficiently manage multiple clients and sites. It includes a new WordPress-centric 24/7 expert customer support service and was built on a modern OpenStack platform that employs a containerized isolated environment for every site using the latest technologies for enhanced performance, scalability and security. We've built in multiple layers of caching, containerized resource scaling, and built-in redundancy as well as SSL on every domain and security site monitoring, back up and firewall, all important features for Pro's. Now in a completely different thread, as you all know I'm retiring at the end of this year. So, I wanted to take a minute to say how proud I am of the GoDaddy team and all we've accomplished together over the last five years. We recruited an exceptional crew. Shifted the brand perception and evolved from a domain centric company to a full scale global technology partner for small businesses. We've been successful of providing best-in-class products and consultative empathetic care to help our customers and their ventures become successful across the globe. The CEO transition to Scott is going very smoothly and everyone here is fired up about our future. And look, I am thrilled and humbled to have been a part of GoDaddy's transformation and growth and I'm excited to watch the Company continue to thrive under Scott's leadership. And I also want to thank all of you, our analysts and investors for your engagement and support since our IPO several years ago. We've always appreciated and welcome your questions, your insight and your sponsorship. So, with that, I'm going to turn the call over to Scott. Scott? Scott Wagner : Thanks Blake. And thank you for your leadership over the last five years. Your contributions to our culture, business and public standing made a lasting impact. I personally look forward to your continued engagement on our Board and I really appreciate our time and partnership together. Now I'd like to share a perspective on where GoDaddy is today and a couple of thoughts on our future opportunities. The GoDaddy of today has several compelling attributes. First, what we do for our customers as both valuable and important to them? GoDaddy enables our customers, small businesses, organizations, personal ventures to take an idea and to turn that idea into an effective online presence and beyond. GoDaddy remains the marketplace for domain names with approximately 73 million names under management. We've put a lot of effort into broadening our product portfolio beyond domains over the last five years, developing successful extensions into adjacent categories like Website building and productivity. With intriguing opportunities, we're pursuing now in security and voice. These extensions have created a broader value proposition for our customers and have enabled us to grow ARPU from $93 at the end of 2012 to $134 today with consistent mid single-digit ARPU growth during our time as a public company. Second, the customer need that we satisfy is a global one and we've proven in a fairly fragmented and competitive environment that we can build a large scale international business. Five years ago, at the end of 2012, we had 10 million customers about 2 million of which were international and just under $200 million of revenue outside the United States. Today, we have more than 7 million international customers and an annual run rate of nearly $800 million of international revenue, almost four times where we were just five years ago. That huge growth was accomplished by developing a scaled localization process for both our Website and our products and extending our go-to-market playbook of attractive LTV to CAC marketing and customer care around the world. Third, we've grown our product and geographic footprint while also investing and distinguishing capabilities like our tech platform and consultative care model. The single tech platform we build has accelerated our development process, letting us introduce products and features quickly and globally, while allowing these products to work better together. Our customer care is unique and allows us to deliver both support and customer oriented solutions that translate into loyalty, high retention, referrals and trade up into other services. Finally, for the investors and our audience, we have a predictable business model with attractive lifetime value to acquisition unit economics and a demonstrated track record of growing both revenue and margins. Since 2012 revenue has grown from about $900 million to what we expect will be over $2.2 billion this year with 2017 unlevered free cash flow expected to be about $485 million, again multiples of what the Company generated just five years ago. So just to summarize those four points, we proved what we do is valuable to customers and addresses a truly global need and we've developed a tech platform, care and other capabilities that are truly distinctive versus competitors all while delivering meaningful growth in topline and cash flow. Now this is great and we're all proud of it, but it's also history. It's particularly exciting for me to look forward to the opportunities ahead of us. There are some things we do in the next several years that build on our past successes while a couple other things will be new and our natural evolution of the Company and our strategy. First, product innovation and expansion will remain a critical block of our strategy both in anchor categories including naming, web presence, and productivity, and extending into additional categories like security, voice and others, where we think we can add distinctive value to our customers. GoCentral is a great example of our innovation here. We've continued rapidly iterate on features, while maintaining the core tenants of simplicity, ease of use, and mobility. Today we're seeing good adoption rates, increasing conversion from free to paid, positive customer feedback and rising net promoter score, all are continuing to rapidly add new features. We have a lot of new functionality coming to market very soon to light up a wide range of vertical solutions and to get deeper into the transactional relationships of our customers and their customers. Beyond GoCentral, our category extension efforts into security in voice continue to hold promise and we'll provide more color on those as we move into 2018, success for our product efforts will be measured by being best-in-class in key categories. Second, as I mentioned earlier, international markets continue to be a major opportunity for us. We're in a good position to grow the business outside the United States at attractive economics and believe international has the potential to be larger than our United States business over time. Our HEG acquisition is added to our breath in Europe and the combination is going really well. We're hitting our operational and financial milestones as you can see in the solid Q3 results. Looking forward, we'll build on these successes both, broadening and deepening our product portfolio and growing internationally, both organically and judiciously using our balance sheet and strong free cash flow over time. Now what will be newer for us going forward are a couple of key initiatives. First, we'll focus on developing a deeper engagement with our existing customers and second, evaluating the opportunity to make greater use of public cloud. First, our customers, our 17 million plus customers are the North Star GoDaddy and are almost precious asset and relationship. Our data clearly shows that when we get our engagement with customer's right, we not only help with an immediate need, but we also create loyalty and develop a deeper relationship. There are many opportunities for us to create great end to end experiences from our customers for merchandising and purchase flows to use of in product application, discovery, to wrapping our products together in bundled subscriptions and much more. This will be a big focus of mine and I expect it to mean both better results for our customers and ultimately continued ARPU growth for GoDaddy. Second, on our approach to the public cloud, GoDaddy today has a sophisticated global private infrastructure running a large chunk of the world's DNS and millions of active Websites and other cloud applications. Our customers value us for the experiences we provide, not necessarily for just the infrastructure itself. So, there's a conceptual opportunity here for us to invest in the public cloud to increase speed, performance of our global products, which our customers value and possibly provide better long-term economics for us. If I take a step back to GoDaddy today is a great business with a terrific team and many great opportunities ahead both to distinctively serve our customers in the marketplace and to consistently deliver results. I am looking forward to the next wave of GoDaddy's evolution and constructing a unique category creating cloud software company that enables ideas to start grow and thrive online all around the world. I am going to turn it over to Ray now to cover our financial picture. Ray? Raymond Winborne : Thanks, Scott. I will cover three points on the financials today. First, we are executing well, delivering strong growth on the topline with another solid quarter of growth in customers and ARPU. Second, we are getting margin expansion through operating leverage, even as we continue to invest in the product roadmap, and third, the highly cash generative nature of this business positions us well to pursue value creating opportunities in the future. My first point, consolidated revenue grew 23% to $582 million coming in at the top of our guidance this quarter. On an organic basis, revenue was up 12% year-over-year, while HEG contributed $53 million in the quarter in line with our guidance. Looking at our two revenue drivers, customers grew nearly 18% to 17.1 million customers, and ARPU came in at $134 up 5% year-over-year. On an organic basis, we've continued to see nice balanced growth with both customers and ARPU up mid-single digits compared to prior year. Finally, our total bookings were $668 million for the quarter growing 25% year-over-year. Let me touch briefly on our three product revenue lines. Domains revenue grew approximately 15% year-over-year in Q3. The majority of the growth was organic driven by international and strong renewals with the remainder attributable to the addition of HEG. We continue to look for organic revenue growth in our domains business to move toward our customer growth rate over the medium to long-term. Hosting and Presence revenue increased over 30% versus Q3 a year-ago with a majority of the incremental revenue coming from HEG. Our expected longer-term growth rate remains roughly one to two times our customer growth rate. Business applications revenue grew 38% in Q3 driven by our growing product suite and customer base along with a small contribution from the addition of HEG. Turning to international, revenue came in at nearly $200 million in Q3 growing 51% year-over-year. Beyond the addition of HEG, GoDaddy's organic business continued to grow at a double-digit clip. As Scott mentioned, we built a scaled international business that now represents over one-third of total revenue and approaching an $800 million annual run rate. We are in over 50 markets around the world with leading positions in many key markets positioning us well for continued strong growth in this business. Staying with international for a minute. It was almost a year-ago that we announced the acquisition of HEG, a highly complementary business that dramatically strengthened our position in Europe. We are now seven months post close and the opportunity for value creation is even stronger than we envisioned. Local leadership is running the day-to-day business of the combined operations in EMEA and making decisions to drive long-term growth. The integration teams are collaborating well and executing on our roadmaps. We continue to focus on optimizing pricing and returns on marketing dollars, enhancing the merchandising experience, and building an integrated European customer care operation. We've also introduced more GoDaddy products to HEG customers, continuing the execution against the roadmap that takes us through next year, and we are learning together. Despite the similarity of these businesses, we are finding lots of opportunity in the different ways we've reached to optimize the customer experience or business outcomes that will benefit our global business going forward. Turning to my second point on cash generation. Unlevered free cash flow grew 44% in Q3 to $137 million demonstrating the inherent leverage in the operating model with terrific flow through from the incremental revenue growth. Looking at the P&L. Gross margin ticked up sequentially and for modeling purposes, we'd recommend holding it in the 65% range going forward. A couple other items to note in the quarter, first, G&A includes $4 million associated with HEG integration cost. And second, we closed on the sale of PlusServer this quarter. This resulted in a net gain on disposal primarily due to FX movements and recognition of a loss on debt extinguishment related to the early retirement of the associated bridge loan. To my third overall point, we finished Q3 with approximately $553 million in cash and short-term investments and net debt of $1.9 billion or about 3.3 times leverage on a pro forma trailing 12-month basis. When we announced the HEG deal a year-ago, we expected to be at the middle of our targeted range of 2 to 4 times by the end of 2017 and we're clearly on track to get there. Our long-term focus remains on driving strong and consistent cash flow as our cash flow and balance sheet capacity expands, you'll continue to see us be thoughtful stewards of capital with the ultimate goal of prudently driving attractive growth and levered free cash flow per share for our investors. So, let's discuss our outlook for Q4 and the full-year. For revenue, we're tightening our full-year range and raising the midpoint. For Q4, we expect revenue in the range of $591 million to $596 million, implying full-year revenue growth of 20% at the midpoint. Given our strong performance, we are raising our expected unlevered free cash flow outlook for the year to approximately $485 million, implying 36% year-over-year growth. Looking forward into 2018, we expect revenue growth in the range of 13% to 15% for the full-year with low double-digit growth once we lap the HEG acquisition in Q2. And we remain confident we can generate unlevered free cash flow of over $600 million next year. Consistent with past practice, our cash flow outlook excludes expected acquisition and integration cost. So, to wrap up, we're continuing to deliver on our strategy and financial expectations and we see very big global opportunity to keep growing the business for many years to come. Now I'll turn the call back to Blake. Blake Irving : Thanks Ray. And not to get whistle on anybody, but I got to tell you it's been my privilege to be a part of GoDaddy's success over these past five years. Leading this incredible group of people and being part of this team has been the experience of a lifetime. And I thank all of you for it. To you investors, analysts, we thank you as always for your time and we're ready to open the call up to your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sam Kemp of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Samuel Kemp : Great. Thanks guys and congrats on a solid quarter. So, congrats to you and the whole company. Scott, I've got two kind of strategic oriented questions, one is around acquisitions. When you look around the world and other geographies that you'd like to move into, do you see other HEG style acquisitions as being part of that core strategy? And then the second, as you talked about moving over the public cloud that's obviously a space that's seen a huge expansion of associated services most of which small businesses aren't really adapt and have to adopt on their own. Do you see this as also an opportunity to expand your product partnerships to bring some of those tools into a reasonable space for a small business? Thanks. Scott Wagner : Thanks Sam. So first other acquisitions like HEG around the world. There are other opportunities that conceptually would look like HEG, but our focus right now is continuing to execute against that or making great progress right now both operationally and financially and that's our priority over the next couple quarters. Assuming we keep ticking along and it goes well. Yes, I think there's more opportunities for us around the world, particularly if you have a three-year to five-year outlook. To your second question on public cloud, over the last five years as we all know there's just been an enormous expansion of capability in the public cloud. You have three companies who poured billions of dollars into capital to build the global infrastructure around it. And we're a global SaaS application company and certainly for us, we think there's an opportunity and the primary opportunity is to use public cloud for speed of deployment and application performance of our products particularly internationally and drive consistency on our operating model and I think what that actually translates into is further help to SMBs, because really were their gateway towards cloud software products and being able to do that around the world with great and consistent performance. Samuel Kemp : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau of William Blair. Your line is open. Matthew Pfau : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. One to touch on GoCentral and the success you're seeing there, just interested to hear, are the customers that you're seeing new to the GoDaddy franchise and as such GoCentral sort of acting as a non-RAM or is it more of a cross-selling to some of your existing customer base? And then I guess in terms of the improved conversion, what has been the primary driver of that? Scott Wagner : Hey, Matt. It's Scott. So first, we're seeing GoCentral customers both coming from the existing base and new. So, the answer is both, and that's probably the best answer for everybody on the phone, which is people who have been with us for a while are adopting GoCentral, love it, their publishing metrics are great as our the NPS and we're bringing new people into the franchise. In terms of conversion metrics, it's good solid free to paid conversion metrics. I think we had highlighted some of those in the last call and we're just seeing good performance out of them and it's a combination of just product quality and better merchandising outreach and just getting people from sign up through the flows faster. We're going to keep working at it as we go. Matthew Pfau : Got it. And then in terms of the ARPU increase that that you saw in the quarter, did cross-selling the HEG customers contribute to that or with that just more of penetrating I guess the core GoDaddy customers and then in terms of products that that's driving that increased ARPU. Anything in particular that sort of stood out in the quarter in terms of improving ARPU? Scott Wagner : Not really, Matt. If you look at ARPU, it's just the aggregate level. You see that it was up 5% in change on a year-over-year basis in terms of growth rate and that's really what we've been doing consistently as a public company. For the last two years plus and really, it's a combination sort of the product expansion within our base and evolution of the product portfolio and attach and there's really no one single thing to highlight, but just to a consistent execution of our strategy. Matthew Pfau : Got it. Thanks for taking my questions guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ron Josey of JMP Securities. Your line is open. Ron Josey : Great, thanks for taking the question. Just a real quick follow-up Scott, on this public cloud transition. Can you talk about just ultimately how you vision this transition using the public cloud provider and specifically the operating expense associated with it, just because the cost were coming on the income statement, but you should benefit CapEx, so any insights there would be helpful around timing and impacts the model? And then I heard a few times talking about enhancing the merchandise experience, which clearly talks about e-commerce in the store solution potentially around GoCentral. So, any other insights here maybe around timing would be helpful? Thank you. Scott Wagner : Yes, thanks Ron. So first on public cloud, as you know and everybody else on the phone does to, these are multi-year journey and other people who are scale global and internet SaaS providers, who are either in the middle of or towards the end or even beginning, see this is a five-year evolution. And so, we're in the early stages of engaging with you know the big three cloud providers and are looking not only the engineering and technical capabilities, but also the strategic relationships we either have or could have with each one of these providers and - at the very early stages of figuring out what the right path for us is. Now you asked a bunch of questions around the economics and had a couple statements in there about OpEx and CapEx and how that transition could play out. And we'll give you the highlights in that really more and as we get into 2018 and really firm up what exactly we're doing. The punch line and takeaways, I think for everybody is we're looking at this hard and the main goal and effort is to continue to facilitate global expansion of our product portfolio with one platform and as we get more insight into this pacific economics, we'll give you some insight. Raymond Winborne : Hi Ron, it's Ray. The only thing I tack onto that is the guidance that we put out through on number of free cash flow, obviously contemplates what we will do in the short-term with respect to cloud. And then your second question was on e-commerce capabilities. GoCentral will continue to evolve feature and functionality set within GoCentral to get deeper into not just a couple of verticals, but really the hundreds of verticals that are indicative of the small business economy around the world. And if you look at small businesses and organizations, the vast majority of them are service businesses. And so, what that means is your time is particularly critical and your time is driven for the most part by your bookings appointment and calendarization. And so, for us, when we think about the next step for GoCentral and e-commerce it's really driving towards service commerce and all the capabilities to be terrific at deep service commerce for hundreds of verticals, not only here in the U.S., but around the world. Ron Josey : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matthew Diamond : Hi guys. This is actually Matt Diamond on Lloyd's behalf. Congrats again on the solid print. I'm just curious about the spending outlook for 2018; we talked about the revenue growth and the free cash flow growth, but any preliminary color you could give on OpEx for next year? Should it more or less approximate revenue growth or is there some dynamic that I maybe not appreciating there? Raymond Winborne : No Matt. No change. It's Ray. No change in the growth algorithm. Obviously, we don't communicate with the street on an adjusted EBITDA basis since last year, but we still run the business that way and so that 18% to 20% growth on that operating standpoint is still where we're targeting, and I think that fits nicely into the model. Matthew Diamond : Okay, great. And housekeeping one for me, we raised HEG guidance last quarter and I can appreciate that it's tough to parse out organic revenues against HEG revenues, but any sort of rough ballpark guidance you could give us for HEGs contribution this quarter? Raymond Winborne : Yes. I think same guidance I gave you guys last quarter, Matt which is if you take a rough cut of the HEG revenue it's 30% domain, 60% hosting and presence, and 10% biz apps. If you apply that against the $52 million through $53 million of revenue you can get a good sense of how it hit the revenue line items and what it contributed. Matthew Diamond : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Ugam Kamat : Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. This is Ugam Kamat on for Sterling Auty. You have mentioned about prioritizing GoCentral, but just wanted to understand how are you prioritizing the allocation of resources to Website Builder 7 versus GoCentral? And are you incentivizing customers to convert from the Website Builder 7 to GoCentral? And then I have a follow-up. Blake Irving : Thanks, Ugam. GoCentral is the go forward platform for us on a DIY from a DIY perspective, and so our resources attention and effort is going against continuing to develop GoCentral. In terms of the conversion of customers, we're creating ways through our care center that our customers can move and we're interacting with them to help customers get to the right solution. But it's a bit of a balance between - if somebody has a great site in presence that they love - they can stay and obviously we're going to work towards helping our customers get to a great solution and one that works for them, but in terms of going forward new builds, new efforts, GoCentral absolutely is that definitive platform for us. Ugam Kamat : All right. Thanks. And on the retention rate, can you provide us any particular trend on how we just trended following your completion of acquisition with HEG? Blake Irving : When you're saying retention rate, I am assuming you're asking about customer retention rate? Ugam Kamat : Yes. Blake Irving : Our customer retention continues to be strong terrific same trajectory as it's been for honestly the last five and 10 plus years. No change whatsoever in the fundamentals of our customer retention both us and HEG. Raymond Winborne : Yes. Ugam with HEG, as we highlighted before, their retention metrics were actually a little better than ourselves. Ugam Kamat : All right. That was helpful. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan of Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Deepak Mathivanan : Hey, guys. Two questions for me. So first, from a product standpoint in 2017, the new Website territory and the security offerings are kind of the key launches during this year. What should we expect for 2018? If you don't want to be more specific perhaps you can talk about what areas you're likely to explore to drive ARPU growth higher? And then the color on international was helpful, but then it's been a couple years since you expanded into new markets in Asia Pacific, can you talk about the recent trends there perhaps in terms of the size of the region from a customer or booking standpoint? What are some of the products that you're seeing continued success there? Thanks guys. Blake Irving : Thanks Deepak. So, first products in 2018, as you know certainly for the last two years, but even really the last five, our continued ARPU success in the mid-single digits has been a combination of several product categories not specifically one in particular. You brought up two really important things that we've been talking about in 2017, one GoCentral and Presence, and two, Security. In terms of the milestones going forward and GoCentral, I would highlight two we just mentioned service commerce and all the capabilities around service commerce. And then second wrapping GoCentral and do a deep vertical execution across hundreds of verticals. And so, you're going to continue to see feature set evolution across both of those areas. And what it will mean is it will just be increased depth of capability not just on a Website, but also extending that Website and other functionality that will make an idea relevant whether you're a tax attorney or a non-profit or an organization and just satisfying those needs. So, a couple of product capabilities are going to be coming really in the next couple of quarters that again should translate into retention, resonance, activation just all the goodness of activity that translates into good business. And on security, security is a terrific add-on that you're seeing both successes on a standalone basis, but also us wrapping security capabilities whether it's CDN or WAF or malware, backup and scanning into our other products. And we're having some toehold success there and that's really one of the things that we're going to be rolling out throughout all next year. So those are maybe two things. And then your trends in APAC, we continue to have good growth. I think we feel good in APAC both customer growth and the trajectory of some of our products and our focus going into next year is going to be around localized marketing and a broader footprint across APAC just continuing to lean into countries that we're seeing good growth in. Because we do see that the core business model and go-to-market that we have is also working in Asia. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein of Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Jason Helfstein : Thanks. Can you elaborate a bit more on the comment about greater engagement with customers? Is it kind of manual engagement to the call centers, getting in front of the customers more often with emails and product announcements features et cetera? So just elaborate a bit more? And then is there a way to think about from a deferred revenues jumped up in the quarter, how much was that due to HEG and they're kind of a perhaps timing issues and how do we think about deferred revenues over the next few quarters until we lap the acquisition? Thanks. Blake Irving : Yes. Thanks, Jason. So, on customer engagement - thanks for the question by the way. Again, today we have 17 million plus customers, many of whom have a life span longer than a decade with us and I know you appreciate and probably many on the phone do too. Perhaps our biggest strategic opportunity as a company is to do more with our base of customers. And over the last five years, we've thrown our shoulder against our product portfolio, adding capabilities to individual applications that we can do for our customers. Today and really over the last year, we found that a lot of the gaps in adoption of these new products our customers actually aren't either a) discovering them or b) just aren't even aware of the capability we have. And so, what that means is we are at a nice stage in our evolution where there's an opportunity to put time and investment into how our customers engage with us across all our touch points meaning our Website both logged in and non-logged in state, care, help, chat all those different touch points and wrapping them in and end experience that if we do it right are going to be ways that our customers discover try and use more of our products. Now I realize I'm answering this at a pretty high level, but it's something where each of these touch points over the last five years have been kind of spread throughout the company and we've been operating them all many in the same in really the same way that we have for a long, long time. And if we take a step back and look at how our customers engage with us? They don't care as much about a) specific product application as much as their idea and how it evolves and if we think about that experience backwards, there's ways that hopefully we can create good engagement with people and ultimately it will drive more product adoption better satisfaction, usage and success of their idea over time. And I'm going to hand Ray's going to takes the second question on deferred. Raymond Winborne : Hey, Jason. It's Ray. So generally, we have counseled folks to model this from a bookings perspective, percentage of bookings in revenue, as you've seen over the past few quarters. Obviously HEG is creating a little bit of noise in those growth rates, but I'd glad to take it offline with you and help you with the model. Jason Helfstein : And just Scott, let me follow up - let me back on the first question, I mean are you thinking about this in context of potentially slower customer growth at some points or not - next year, but at some point, customer go slow, and the point is that you think that there is more meaningful upside on the upsell? Scott Wagner : No Jason, that's not the signal. The takeaway is we're going to really think about and created a great end and experience across the 17 million customers. So, it's not a substitution hub, it's an end. Jason Helfstein : Okay, thank you. Scott Wagner : Yes. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Kees of Summit Redstone. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Jonathan Kees : Great, thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to just focus on the integration in progress with the HEG integration. Last quarter you had mentioned at the bookings with HEG was a little bit below the company as a whole and you were working on customer care in improving and improving the bookings order rate there? Just curious how that's doing and also in terms of the take rate with the business applications and even the attach rate with domains obviously they're heavy on the Hosting and Presence, and you talked about selling them pushing the other products within to increase ARPU. So, I wonder how ARPU is doing relative to company whole. And then anything else like with the backend offices system infrastructure, if that's already been consolidated and are we running on a more optimized network? Thank you. Scott Wagner : Hey, Jonathan, it's Scott. When we think about the HEG integration, we're really happy with where we are, and I think I'd go back to three points that we're working on. The first is creating a global product portfolio and layering that across Europe both underneath the GoDaddy brand in the couple of heritage brands within HEG. The second is creating a single both infrastructure and platform that goes from our tech infrastructure to our platform capabilities to customer care. We're well underway across all those three things. And finally, what we are now able to do is increase our go-to-market effort across Europe primarily into the GoDaddy brand and we're seeing good traction operationally across each of those three things and if you're looking at the financial results, we're right on track with where we want to be. Jonathan Kees : Okay, great. Thanks for that color. Good luck. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Essex of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Brian Essex : Hi, good afternoon, and thank you for taking the question. Congrats on a quarter. Maybe Scott, a question for you just on that last comment that you had around, how you're approaching Europe under the GoDaddy brand. What about the legacy HEG brands, 123 Reg, how do you - I know you're going to kind of lean on some of the brand equity that that HEG had in Europe. But has it changed at all and maybe how do we think about Europe and the rest of the emerging markets you had pretty good international growth this quarter? Blake Irving : Yes. Thanks Brian. We're happy again with Europe overall both GoDaddy and HEG, specifically in Europe. GoDaddy is and will be our primary brand in terms of incremental marketing spend and effort. Now HEG has a portfolio of brands and there are a couple - and you mentioned one, two, three reg in the UK and domain factory in Germany which have terrific execution and a nice position in the market. And what we'll do is use those as complimentary brands maybe with a little extra emphasis on a product or two or a go-to-market effort or two, but won't be incremental. And so, we're happy with the position and the thinking around how we can use those heritage brands in a complimentary way again around GoDaddy to have a nice position in the UK and Germany for the next several years ahead. And when we think about expanding into other markets, our primary effort will be under the GoDaddy brand. Brian Essex : Got it. And maybe to follow-up with Ray. I mean, I think you initially indicated that I think the $20 million synergy target with the combination of HEG. Where do we stand with regard to your synergy targets? Have you uncovered additional maybe asset rationalization and what can we expect going forward incremental to any kind of margin accretion from the combination of the business? Raymond Winborne : Hey, Brian. It's Ray. We are well on track to achieve the $20 million plus synergies by the end of next year. We have uncovered new synergies as we've gone through particularly infrastructure, but still on track to deliver at our commitment or better by the end of next year. Brian Essex : All right. Super helpful. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Thanks. Just a question on the organic growth at 12%, I think for the last couple years you've been between a pretty tight range of 12% to 15% realize, you had a tough comp last 3Q. But anything organically that you're seeing that that maybe different than you've seen historically or pretty much in line? Raymond Winborne : No, Brent. It's Ray. Haven't seen anything that would change the trajectory there. It's been solid all year. We continually updated the guidance to reflect that so nothing to point out there. Brent Thill : Okay. And for Scott, there's been a lot of focus on the online store. I don't know if you have a sense of kind of penetration of where you could be and why is this constrained to just the services commerce versus a broader commerce opportunity for the customer you're serving? Scott Wagner : Yes. Thanks Brent. Well I think you got to do some first and our first effort is around having a fantastic execution of service commerce. Now we do have as part of GoCentral, an online - again store for the sales of physical goods and inventory. That is a great entry level service that is terrific and works well. I think our primary focus right now is wrapping service commerce around that footprint and focused on being able to do that around the world now. When you ask about commerce and particularly physical inventory, it's such a local execution country-by-country and that has a whole set of capabilities required to do that locally around the world. Again, we do think GoCentral - one of its advantages is the global nature of our execution. Over half of our sign ups - incremental sign-ups are coming from outside the United States and GoCentral. But again, you're getting our first step or next step in the evolution around service commerce, integration service commerce possibly with product capabilities, but make sure that that solution works great not only here in the United States, but also more around the world. Brent Thill : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark May of Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Mark May : Thanks for taking my questions. Hopefully they haven't been addressed. Can you talk - can you shed some light on what the main driver of - hit some nice gross margin improvement in the quarter with the main driver of that was. And then I think that you helped us with the HEG revenue contribution in the quarter, but can you comment on what HEGs organic growth rate was in the quarter? Thanks. Raymond Winborne : Hey, Mark, it's Ray. So as far gross margin, you've seen a tick-up in the last few quarters, nothing unusual to highlight this quarter. I think as you continue to see the shift from domains to the higher margin software products, you'll see that float up. But as I noted in my remarks, we're still recommending folks to guide or to model at that 65% range. Again, we just don't want to box ourselves in there. We want the flexibility to be able to invest there and not to affect our build-by-partner on products or pricing actions we may take or even to Scott's point about cloud, how infrastructure deployment might affect their gross margin. As far as HEG organic growth, that business is continuing to perform well. Again, you could see our overall margins and revenue growth rate was at the top of our guidance. So, we're managing those businesses together so that the customers are going to whichever brand that they're being driven to by the marketing. Mark May : My recollection is HEG generally has a little bit slower growth profile than the legacy GoDaddy business. If that's true, it looks like GoDaddy organic grew about 12% this quarter and you're guiding to - as you anniversary the HEG deal to be growing in the low double-digits next year. Am I reading into your assumption there is that you'll either see an improvement in the HEG revenue growth or are you expecting an improvement in the kind of more the legacy business? Raymond Winborne : We're guiding those together, Mark. So, it's 12% was the GoDaddy rough justice in Q3. When you look at the double-digit that we're projecting or targeting for next year, that's the combined growth rate. So, we're not looking at these separately. Mark May : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Kessler of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Aaron Kessler : Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Just a couple things. First on the premium solutions, the growth drivers. How would you kind of rank order key growth driver there between kind of Office 365, some of your marketing solutions and other? And then maybe just on the GoCentral, I know it's kind of still early, how would you potentially rank kind of what's in development here? And then we think of vertical solutions, how many do you think you can launch per year? Thank you. Scott Wagner : Well, in terms of premium solutions, I think you're looking at business applications or at least I'm interpreting, Aaron. And the vast majority of our revenues still in that business applications category is productivity both Office 365 and GoDaddy's proprietary email solution of workspace and that's a nice balance between the two. Those both continue to grow nicely. Now to your second question, on GoCentral, how many verticals can we expect per year? Well, what's nice about GoCentral is the on boarding process for GoCentral is really AI and initiative-driven or idea-driven where the very first thing you do is type in what the idea for the site is about and that already has the capability for hundreds of verticals. Now when I say put a little more effort into it, there's 20 verticals that are the first wave that are verticals you would expect in some ways you could just follow the small business economy for those 20 verticals that will be rolling out early next year with a much deeper set of both content and features. And after those roll, they'll be again 10 dozens of verticals to roll beyond that, but it's not a specific. We're not going one or two verticals. It's a horizontal capability merchandised vertically. Aaron Kessler : Maybe just quickly if you can comment on how acquisitive you look to be in the business apps going forward and what you're seeing in terms of evaluations there? Raymond Winborne : Well, the nice thing about our business and where we are is first and foremost back to the customer comment or Jason's - customer comment, we've got 17 million customers who have ideas, businesses, at some stage of development and looking to develop those ideas online. And our opportunity as a consistent platform and with a great delivery model is as those ideas develop, we can add more and more things over time. We've taken a nice couple of steps over the last few years and we've had some success and I think that's reflective of the customer permission we have to develop more things with and for our customers over time. In terms of specific categories, we will continue to go through the build by partner analysis and discipline with the goal of having a great distinctive solution if we're going into a category. Our bar for ourselves is higher than just doing something if we do anything in a category, we should be good if not great, and so that will drive with a focus on great and that'll drive the build by partner decision to be distinctive in the categories in which we compete. Aaron Kessler : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sameet Sinha of B. Riley FBR. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Sameet Sinha : Yes. Thank you very much. A couple of questions here and I apologize if these have been asked before, but the free cash flow growth - long-term growth that you've always highlighted above 15% to 20%, what sort of ARPU and customer growth does that imply? And the second question is on the GoCentral and the legacy platform. You balancing both of them, can you talk about the incremental cost of managing both of them? And I mean is that a risk that potentially in the future as GoCentral picks up you would have diverted more resources, which could have an impact on your existing customer base was on the legacy platform? And that's kind of derivative question is, is there an easy way to put old sites into the new ones maybe an automated solution that might make it worthwhile? Thank you. Scott Wagner : It's Scott. In terms of free cash flow growth algorithm, customers and ARPU, I think hitting that free cash flow target is a consistent execution of what we've been doing, so no real change in terms of customer and ARPU growth. In terms of your cost to manage GoCentral, we really address - I think we addressed that earlier and the big point is don't worry about it. We've got a - GoCentral is absolutely skilled international platform and the adoption and focus of everything we're doing from a DIY, CMS is going to be around GoCentral. Sameet Sinha : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Naved Khan of SunTrust. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Naved Khan : Thank you very much. I just wanted to go back to your previous comment about maybe the opportunity to do more with existing base of $17 million, if I look at the or if you were to look at your product offering, do you see some obvious holes there? Do you see any opportunity for maybe filling those through M&A, any color would be helpful? Raymond Winborne : Well as of right now, Naved we've leaned into several categories. Presence would GoCentral, certainly security and voice and we're focused on building those up and are obviously evaluating some new categories as we have been doing for the last five years. And I don't have anything specific to tell you other than we're looking at other categories where we can have an awesome solution that is great and distinctive for our customers and can be good economics for us. Naved Khan : Okay, thanks. And then quick follow-up. I think previously you have talked about bringing WordPress, GoCentral, Office 365 for the HEG brands, is that 2018 target or is that currently happening in the current year as well? Blake Irving : It's happening as we speak and as part of underlying when both Ray and I say we're hitting our operational and financial targets, all of those products that are rolling out to those brands are part of it. Naved Khan : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Zachary Schwartzman : Hey. It's Zachary Schwartzman on for Mark. Thanks for taking the question. This is related to some of the business app questions you've had. How do you see that shifting over time in terms of revenue mix? How much do you feel that business applications can grow to as a percentage of the total revenue over the next couple years? And another question on the debt ratio, can you remind us your target leverage ratio and how do you think about using free cash flow to paydown debt versus keeping us dry powder for potential acquisition and/or other investments? Thanks. Raymond Winborne : Hey, Mark, it's Ray. I'll start with your second question around free cash flow. Our targeted range for leverage is still two to four times. As I said in call, comment, remarks, we expect to be there by the end of the year. As far as paying down debt, a very attractive debt structure today with effectively a 3% effective rate that's 50/50 floating versus fix, so I think what we would tend to do is hold the cash for now, so that we've got excess capacity in flexibility there. Scott Wagner : Yes, Zach, it's Scott. On business apps, obviously the growth has been terrific over the last several years and we've told everybody to think about that growth rate as being three to four times the rate of our customers and I think that that target range still applies. Zachary Schwartzman : Great, thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters. Blake Irving : Oh, great. Hey everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. Appreciate it. And we'll talk to everybody in a quarter. Take care, bye. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Chris, and I\u2019ll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the GoDaddy Q4 2017 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Christie Masoner, Senior Manager of Investor relations, you may begin the conference. Christie Masoner : Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for GoDaddy\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings call. With me today are Scott Wagner, Chief Executive Officer; and Ray Winborne, Chief Financial Officer. We\u2019ll share some prepared remarks and then we\u2019ll open the call up for your questions. On today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and operating metrics such as total bookings, unlevered free cash flow, net debt and ARPU. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents may be found in the presentation posted to our Investor Relations website at investors.godaddy.net or on our Form 8-K which will be filed with the SEC with today\u2019s earnings release. The matters we\u2019ll be discussing today include forward-looking statements which include those related to our future financial results, new product introductions and innovations, our ability to integrate recent or potential future acquisitions and achieve desired synergies, including our recent acquisition of HEG and our proposed acquisition of Main Street Hub. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, February 22, 2018, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. Unless otherwise stated when we refer to organic measures, we\u2019re referring to those measures excluding the impact of HEG and Main Street Hub. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Scott. Scott Wagner : Thanks, Christi. And thanks to all of you for joining us today. We feel great about how we closed 2017 with another year of consistently good growth in the books. At year-end 2017, we'd grown to serve 17.3 million customers, an increase of 18% versus a year ago, driven by both strong organic growth and the addition of HEG in April of last year. Our average revenue per user or ARPU also rose over 7% to $139. We finished 2017 with revenue of $2.2 billion and bookings of 2.6 billion, both up 21%, and unleveraged free cash flow $496 million, up 39% year-over-year, demonstrating our ability to deliver growth at scale in both our top and bottom lines. 2018 is off to a strong start as well, which we'll see in our increased guidance for the year that Ray is going to discuss a bit later. We want GoDaddy to be known as the place where ideas start, grow and thrive online all around the world. And today, we're a global leader in helping individuals and businesses create an online presence with particularly strength in naming websites and branded e-mail. We have a distinctive value proposition that combines our products, technical platform and customer care to uniquely serve customers and grow with their ideas over time. In the coming year, we'll look to build on our solid foundation and invest in several ways to continue driving multi-year sustainable growth. Our priorities are to deepen engagement with existing customers, continue to expand our product portfolio, grow our international footprint, build and evolve on our exceptional brand awareness and enhance the speed, reliability and performance of our global infrastructure. Today I\u2019d like to discuss two topics in a bit more detail to demonstrate our commitment to these priorities. First our expanding view of what it means for us to provide a truly differentiated online presence. And second the continuing evolution of our global go-to-market strategy. First, I\u2019ll start with our view on providing a great online presence. Whether you\u2019re a business, non-profit, sports team or politician, a dynamic, great looking, reliable and effective online presence is a must have. Our customers tell us that how they show up online is the most important and effective marketing they can do. The definition of what it means to have a great online presence continues to expand. Domain names and websites are in many ways the foundation of the Internet and their functionality and importance is evolving in a couple of meaningful ways. First, given the proliferation of social media platforms, online content needs to exist and to be managed across many more places. And second, product applications which used to be standalone point solutions such as booking engines, ASO services, blogs and email marketing are now increasingly being integrated into a singular online presence. At GoDaddy, we\u2019ve made great progress innovating against both of these trends. First, to help us further extend and sink our customers\u2019 website content to different social media platforms, we\u2019ve recently launched new integrations to Facebook small business pages and Google My Business where customers can update and manage their content to both platforms directly from the GoCentral Editor. We\u2019ve also recently announced we\u2019re acquiring Main Street Hub, which manages branding and social media engagement for our customers and will ultimately allow GoDaddy to offer customers a complete suite of do-it-for-me capabilities to build complete suite of do it for me capabilities to build a powerful online presence across website design and maintenance, SCO and social media. Main Street Hub combines dedicated teams of branding experts with proprietary workflow technology to help their customers manage activity on popular social media platforms. Turning to the second trend I mentioned, the industry is shifting from point solutions to fully integrated applications. On that front, GoCentral is evolving rapidly, particularly as we do more to make vertical experiences come alive. Today, over 80% of our customers now have a tailored theme and application experience specifically relevant for their industry or vertical and we continue to add richness to this vertical capability. Over the last several months, we've added powerful features like online appointment scheduling including automated SMS and email notifications. Payment integration with Square and two-way calendar sync. Now again, this isn't about a website in the traditional sense, but about bringing a full range of capabilities to customers where they might previously have had to seek separate point solutions. We've done all this with GoCentral, while achieving high customer satisfaction scores, increasing numbers of published sites and the hundreds of thousands and continuing to drive free to paid conversion up in the mid-single digits. We believe we're well-positioned to drive the industry forward in delivering what a venture or an idea needs to start, grow and thrive. Our long-term vision is to provide a true platform, where anyone in need of an online presence have every \u2013 has everything they need in one place with applications working together seamlessly. So that's our view of the evolution of online presence. I'd also like to touch on the ongoing evolution of our go-to-market strategy. Over the last five years as we've expanded into dozens of international markets, we've proven our business and particularly our go-to-market model translates well globally. Going forward, we intend to build on the strong foundation in several ways. First, continuing our international expansion, bringing more localized versions of our products and services to customers around the world. Second, evolving our brand story. We intend to maintain our light-hearted edginess while also expanding and solidifying our position as the place to make your idea real online. For example, we have a number of local campaigns running around the world showcasing how GoDaddy easily powers an online presence including our union with Danica Patrick in the U.S., highlighting her life after racing as she begins to turn what were her side hustles into full time passions. You\u2019ll see several of these geo-specific campaigns in our earning slides and they all tie to a common thread, that GoDaddy makes creating a complete and successful online presence really easy. Third, we\u2019re also increasing our ability to do direct customer marketing, including introducing our ever-broader product portfolio to our existing base of 17 plus million customers through targeted and contextual marketing campaigns focused on deepening our customers engagement with us. Throughout our history, we\u2019ve focused almost all of our marketing spend on new customer acquisition which is logical given our attractive unit economics where GoDaddy customers generate a lifetime value of roughly 10 times our cost to acquire those customers. However, with our expanded product portfolio, there\u2019s far more we can do with and for our existing customers, so we\u2019re ramping up our efforts there. Now this is still small on a relative scale, but as we leverage data and are constantly improving global platform we\u2019re discovering that we can deploy additional spend into many micro campaigns at good incremental return. One more quick point before I wrap. In November we first talked with everyone about our opportunity to leverage the public cloud. We've run a detailed process looking at several partners certainly on their cloud capabilities, but also addressing other product and go-to-market opportunities. We hope to announce a partnership soon that will allow us to embark on a multi-year transition to the cloud. And as we reflect on all these things, whether it\u2019d be our products or go-to-market or evolving technical platform, we hope that you can see that they all work in ladder into delivering truly great customer experiences all around the globe. Strategically our biggest asset is our 17-plus million paying customer base and our growth priorities remain focused on continuing to both expand that base and to do more with existing customers over time. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ray. Ray Winborne : Thanks Scott. As Scott mentioned we finished the year strong and carry that momentum into the new year, driving an increase in our 2018 guidance. We're executing well, driving consistent growth in customers and ARPU combining to deliver a solid top line. Both revenue and cash flow for Q4 came in ahead of our expectations with straight across the board. For the full year, we posted exceptional bookings and revenue growth with both up 21%. But just as important we deliver better than expected organic growth, north of 12%. HEG contributed $56 million in the fourth quarter revenue. Let me touch briefly on our three product revenue lines. First, domains revenues were 16% year-over-year in Q4, fueled by international growth, strong renewals, aftermarket domain sales and the addition of HEG. We've continually invested in our platform to make domains easy to find buy and use as a result our domains under management of $75 million has grown by $20 million names over the last five years, clearly demonstrating that domains matter and owning your brand online matters. Domains is now over a $1 billion annual business for us and we expect solid growth to continue through 2018. Longer term, we continue to expect domains to grow in line with our customer growth. Our hosting and presence revenue increased 29% in the quarter with the majority of the incremental revenue again coming from HEG. Exiting 2017 with nearly $850 million in revenue, we still see plenty of room to grow in this category, targeting one to two times our customer growth rate over the long-term. Business applications revenue rose 38% driven by continued strong growth in our \u2013 in both productivity and email marketing, as well as a growing product suite and the addition of HEG. At over $325 million of revenue in 2017, we continue to believe we have ample opportunity to grow this revenue stream at three times to four times our customer growth rate longer term. Turning to international, Q4 revenue came in at $207 million. It\u2019s 53% year-over-year growth. Beyond the addition of HEG, GoDaddy's organic international business grew a double-digit clip as we continue to push localization and extend our go-to-market playbook and customer care globally. Finally, after a couple of years of headwind, currency is now providing a slight tailwind to our international growth. Looking at cash flow, the combination of solid bookings growth and strong operating leverage continues to generate terrific growth. Another free cash flow jumped 43% in Q4 to $109 million and 39 % for the full year to $496 million, resulting in a nearly 300 basis point year-over-year expansion in our cash margin to 22% margin expansion has been driven both by our continued organic operating leverage and by HEG\u2019s contribution. On that topic, we\u2019re executing well against our HEG integration plan and we\u2019re on track to deliver $20 million synergy target by the end of this year. Let me touch on a few housekeeping items with respect to the P&L this quarter. First, the implementation of ASC 606, the new revenue recognition accounting standard, will now result in any changes to our current method of revenue recognition or reporting. Second, as you know, the recent tax reform act resulted in significant changes to the corporate tax code. While we have a somewhat unique tax structure, many of the provisions impact us in similar ways to a traditional C-Corp, the lower corporate tax rate being the most meaningful. In the fourth quarter, we recorded a non-cash benefit of $86 million to reflect the impact of the lower corporate rate on our existing TRA liability. Based on our assessment, we don\u2019t currently expect other provisions of the act to have a material impact on our financials, but we\u2019ll continue to monitor interpretive guidance as it\u2019s issued. And third, G&A expense this quarter includes a couple of items worth noting. $6 million in acquisition and integration costs associated with HEG and Main Street Hub and a $12 million reserve for exposure related to our obligation to collect and remit pass through taxes on behalf of government entities. We provided a table near the end of the earnings release highlighting these and other items which may be helpful to those of you building models. On the balance sheet, we finished the year with $595 million in cash in short-term investments and net debt of $1.9 billion. This put our leverage at 3.1 times on a pro forma trailing 12 basis, right in the middle of our target range of two to four times. During the quarter, we took advantage of market conditions and refinanced our term loans, lowering our interest rate to LIBOR plus 2.25%. This new rate implies cash interest payments in 2018 of $90 million to $95 million. Turning to the rest of our outlook for 2018. In the first quarter, we expect revenue of $620 million to $625 million including a $65 million to $70 million contribution from HEG, implying year-on-year organic growth about 13% at the midpoint. For the full year 2018, we expect revenue of $2.58 billion to $2.61 billion, representing approximately 16% growth at the midpoint versus 2017. This includes one incremental quarter from HEG and the anticipated contribution of roughly $10 million per quarter in the back half of the year from our planned acquisition of Main Street Hub. Cutting through the math, here's your take away. The full year guide implies 11% to 13% year-on-year organic growth, on par with what we delivered in 2017 on a much bigger base of revenue. Moving to cash flow, we expect 2018 unlevered free cash flow of $605 million to $625 million, implying 24% year-over-year growth at the midpoint and continued margin expansion. Three quick notes on that cash flow guidance. First, it includes total cash tax related payments in the $25 million to $30 million range comparable to 2017. Second, it also includes any costs related to our expected public cloud transition in 2018. And third, it excludes an anticipated one-time tax payment associated with the gain on the plus server sale last year. For quarterly modeling purposes, we suggest you assume that our unlevered free cash flow will be evenly split across the four quarters of 2018. Stepping back, we continue to create franchise distinction and competitive advantage with a business capable of delivering double-digit top-line and high teens growth in unlevered free cash flow. As our cash flow and balance sheet capacity expands, you will continue to see us be thoughtful stewards of capital with the ultimate goal of prudently driving attractive growth in levered free cash flow per share for our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Scott. Scott Wagner : Thanks, Ray. We look forward to continuing to deliver against our strategy with differentiated customer experiences. We're excited for 2018 and see a big opportunity to continue to grow the GoDaddy business both this year and for the long-term. We hope to share more details with you, demo some products and hear your questions at our Investor Day in the afternoon at March 28 in Tampa, Arizona. Thanks, everyone for your time, and we\u2019re ready to open up the call to questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Sam Kemp with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Samuel Kemp : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. First one on Main Street Hub, so this is a higher touch model then you\u2019ve historically gone after. Can you just talk about how you\u2019re planning on incorporating it into the product adoption funnel for users? And is there any sort of level of automation that you plan on bringing to Main Street Hub that potentially wasn\u2019t there before? And then the second is just on SmartLine. You didn't provide an update during the quarter, I don\u2019t know if those intentional or not but can you just talked about your evolved thoughts on the go-to-market strategy there and adoption? Scott Wagner : Yeah, thanks Sam. It\u2019s Scott. So, on Main Street Hub, Main Street Hub's model it is higher touch and it's helping customers fully set up and particularly manage the communication process through all the different touch points of social media. And as of right now, our focus is going to be on introducing this proposition to what we think is about two million high potential customers within our base, during diligence we screen their value proposition for their highest and best performing customers and finally we had about a two million overall TAM within our base and so our first focus is setting ourselves up to introduce the services that exist today into the GoDaddy base. Second and this is where it really gets interesting is taking workflow technology to manage content and actually helping to syndicate that through everybody's different points of presence, whether it be a website or social media or even email and communication plans that customers would have with their own customers. That's going to be down the road. But that's really where we're headed with Main Street Hub. To your second question on SmartLine, SmartLine today has tens of thousands of customers who are continuing to evolve with the feature set nicely. Over the last quarter or two, we've added things like texting, call forwarding, some toll-free number capabilities and particularly texting is having really great customer resonance. We're happy with the product and with that feature evolution and we're just continuing to build it up. I mean, the big focus now is, boy, just continue to build a use case around tens of thousands of bases of customers that they're going to work with. I think the point for people listening and thinking about 2018 is obviously it's at a scale where it's not going to affect our financials this year, but it's a product and a value proposition that we are continuing to work on and are attracted by. Samuel Kemp : Got it. Thanks for taking the questions and nice quarter. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Sterling Auty : Yeah. Thanks. Hi guys. So, the domain revenue was really strong in the quarter and based on the commentary for 2018, it sounds like the trend line of that growth going down to the customer growth is not quite happening as fast as we originally thought. It sounds like it's going to stay above that rate through 2018 before it starts to tail off. I\u2019m just kind of curious, what is the main drivers behind domain revenue growth being better for longer than maybe we first expected. Ray Winborne : Hey, Sterling. It\u2019s Ray. Obviously, we gave you guys that guide last year. It was a longer-term look. So, we are seeing continued solid growth in there, a lot of that is coming from continued improvements in our domain purchase path, just how you come on the side and how do you acquire domain, how are we packaging it with other products. And then the other impact you saw this quarter, little lighter than that was just the diminishing impact of purchase accounting on the HEG component of domains. Sterling Auty : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Lloyd Walmsley : Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Two if I can. First on HEG, can you give us a sense if there are any other big upcoming milestones you guys are looking to hit in terms of operationally to unlock more synergy on the revenue side. And then kind of related second one, you mentioned a focus on a more localized marketing effort going forward, can you just talk about how far \u2013 how close you are in some of your international markets in terms of the go-to-market there relative to kind of your best-in-class U.S., localized go-to-market and kind of how you see that improving over the timeframe over which you can really localize in those markets like you do in the U.S.? Scott Wagner : Hey, Lloyd, it\u2019s Scott. So, on the synergy, we\u2019re feeling really good about reaching and exceeding our $20 million target that we\u2019ve communicated to everybody which is a combination of both revenue and cost. And so, operationally, you can think about what we\u2019re working on, on two fronts. The first is product and platform and the second is just our go-to-market effort. On product and platform, we\u2019re putting our products together into a single global product portfolio. So, for example, SSL, all of the aftermarket services in our \u2013 we\u2019re very close on domains to having those all basically running in the same place, productivity is shortly to follow and hosting a little further beyond that. And so, there\u2019s no one single milestone, but those are tracking really nicely. On the second operational category, which is merchandising and go-to-market, we\u2019re building a single care organization in Europe that\u2019s ticking along nicely and we\u2019re continuing to put marketing dollars into the countries in Europe based on our footprint and our relative opportunity. And I think that\u2019s probably the relevant takeaway for you which is we\u2019re running EMEA together, both HEG and the GoDaddy brands and our scale and our scale in half there is allowing us to continue to message and expand our position and are certainly markets where we have a big footprint like the UK, but also to invest more into some of the continental markets where we have a smaller presence, but think we can ramp. And the tactics really aren\u2019t different; it\u2019s the same marketing playbook of brand awareness combined with some super sharp performance marketing underneath that that\u2019s got really nice return. The overall focus on messaging is around who we are, who we stand for, and what we do which is get ideas, a great online presence and help them grow over time. Ray Winborne : Lloyd, it\u2019s Ray. The only thing I tack on to that is that the integration roadmap we\u2019re well along that path and feel good about the promised $20 million in synergies by the end of the year. Lloyd Walmsley : Great. And then any just broader color on increased localization beyond HEG, and how to think about that going forward? Ray Winborne : I think Lloyd, you can think about it on two fronts. Localization is our global product portfolio, which again it\u2019s hallmark of what we do and we continue to localize products whether they\u2019re naming or certainly our presence. So, for example, GoCentral, the localization capabilities of that continues to evolve. And then on the go-to-market side, I think in some of the -- on the IR slides, we flashed a couple of campaigns that are running around the world and what you see is an overall brand position of GoDaddy being a place for ideas to become real and to thrive online, but with local execution. And so, if people want to have fun, go check out both what we\u2019re running in the U.K., what we\u2019re doing in Australia to come maybe what\u2019s coming in Germany, and you\u2019re going to see kind of locally relevant campaign execution, but with the same overall message. Lloyd Walmsley : Got it. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt Pfau with William Blair. Your line is open. Matt Pfau : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Scott, wanted to dig into a comment you made relative to the Main Street Hub acquisition? And maybe I'm reading too much into it, but it sounded like there was potentially opportunity to start offering more do-it-for-me services down the road. So, is this true, is this sort of an area that you're potentially evaluating additional do-it-for-me services, that you offer to your customer base? And then relative to that, you do have relationships with a lot of web pros that in a way offer do-it-for-me services themselves? So, how do you sort of toe that line in terms of not stepping on some of the web pros that you have relationships with? Scott Wagner : Yeah. Thanks, Matt. That's a great -- it\u2019s sort of a great question. I think two things are, they're complimentary, not contradictory and that's the most important point. And if you follow customers around the line between DIY and DIFM is also not a hard one and there's a real spectrum between those different activities. So, that\u2019s a super important point to communicate and understand. With Main Street Hub, also when you think about activities that our customers are doing online, their website, both design, maintenance, updating, social media presence, some marketing and communication campaigns, SCO optimization. Five years ago, those were all discreet activities and we\u2019re trying to bring those together both productizing them and for those customers, who want a little bit of a boost or help to create the capability to help them to do that. And look, that\u2019s the part of the core value proposition that we\u2019re able to offer at GoDaddy which is combining truly distinctive products at a global level wrapped with a personal interaction. Now when it comes to pros, pros are a big part of that and pros are these independent, largely independent or small groups of designers that might be doing these services also for people. This is complimentary and we can help pros both get customers and for those who have maintenance requirements maybe do some of the same stuff on behalf of pros, but we see this as complementary not contradictory. Matt Pfau : Great. That\u2019s it for me guys. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Your line is open. Ron Josey : Great. Thanks for taking the question. And I wanted to ask maybe about total bookings that came in on our numbers at least you know 3% or so above our projections and that\u2019s despite ending customers being relatively in line. And so, I\u2019m wondering Scott, if we\u2019re starting to see maybe the beginning of the benefits around improved merchandizing and bundling as the new customer care team rolls out? And if so, can you talk about just the timeline as we see this customer care team and the benefits of -- as merchandizing bundling throughout the year? Thank you. Scott Wagner : Hey Ron. Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t attribute it to anyone, it meaning good bookings performance, relative ARPU to any one specific thing. But I would say it\u2019s a combination of our marketing message and footprint, which is what we say and how we reach customers both new and existing. As you said, our merchandizing flows and how we\u2019re bringing our products together in a clean way and you know how our care team is helping to steward that process and it really is a combination of all those things that\u2019s I think helping propel the business. Ron Josey : Got it. Maybe if I could just follow-up on GoCentral, I think you said also hundreds of thousands of sites have been created with mid-single-digit conversion rates which have been maintained, can you just talk about how many of your, call it 17 million users have been exposed to GoCentral and is that an opportunity as you go on? Thank you. Ray Winborne : Thanks, Ron. I think, it\u2019s interesting where a lot of our base of customers is 17 million, they have an idea that\u2019s in some form of development and by that development meaning an idea that\u2019s connected to some form of an active presence. And when we look at not only our base, but frankly the base of sites and ideas in the world, this net opportunity of taking a side and actually expanding it into a mobile social world is a big opportunity and it\u2019s taking in some ways sites that have kind of largely stayed the same for the last 8 years to 10 years and really bring in new capability. And I think your specific question then which was exposure hits on that possibility and theme and the answer is we\u2019re sort of trying to both figure out how to not only just create exposure, but also the right mechanism by which you can grab somebody who may have a version one side and actually connected into the mobile social world. We think it\u2019s a big opportunity, we think we\u2019re in some ways uniquely positioned to be able to do it, but we got some work to do actually turn that into a major system at the level that we could actually go talk to you guys about and put hard numbers behind it. Ron Josey : Got it. Thanks a lot. Great quarter. Ray Winborne : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Sameet Sinha with B Riley FBR. You line is open. Sameet Sinha : Yes. Thank you very much. Couple of questions regarding your acquisitions. So, starting with HEG, you kind of indicating Q1 $65 million to $70 million, you know versus the $56 million that they did in the fourth quarter. So, it seems like you know when you had acquired the company you had indicated it's currently growing at low single-digits. We aim to get it to high single-digits. So are we at that inflection point with HEG because the growth seems to be fairly significant from four to first quarter. And secondly, somewhat picking up on your comments on Main Street Hub, so if you indicate 2 million potential customers for this product, if you look at media reports they indicate about a $300 ARPU, monthly ARPU. So is that I mean are we talking about an opportunity which goes into billions of dollars or I'm going to leave it there for you to answer. Ray Winborne : Hey Sameet its Ray. On the HEG that business is growing nicely. We've gotten some uptick in the top line growth there, but as you look at that guide or that sequential stuff up in the revenue some of that sum it's a mix right of Q1 seasonality you get a little bit a lift there and then the other piece of it is diminishing impact of purchase accounting as that revenue normalizes to reflect the run rate of net bookings. So, I would say if you want to look at it that way it's probably a third where we're getting some inflection on growth on the top line. The other two-thirds is seasonal and, and purchase accounting. And on Main Street Hub, Sameet, yeah, again I said that two million TAM, so total addressable market and boy you know you, you did the simple math and you know your eyes can get big, big on that. But here is, here is what that two million correlates to when you take Main Street Hub\u2019s customers who have been with them through Main Street Hub\u2019s customers who have been with them through not only a renewable cycle but also their highest NPS customers. We took that customer base and did a screen on industry vertical, website position and their social media development and kind of match those customers to our customers and said wow there's about 10 million \u2013 excuse me 2 million customers in our base that have similar characteristics. All right now what's our ability to actually deliver the service build it up to them it's \u2013 it realistically is smaller than that. I think the takeaway is to say that there's certainly a customer need when we think about this net of proposition of taking site content and connecting it to social media and providing some sort of productize to assist that we're excited about and that's the fundamental logic behind Main Street Hub. Obviously, there's work to do to grow from where they are to capture that that kind of opportunity. Scott Wagner : Yes. I mean it's very I think attack on that right. When you look at that 2 million customers it is a smaller subset because of that ARPU. That's a dramatically higher ARPU than our average customer. Sameet Sinha : So, it's about a 300 monthly ARPU business. Scott Wagner : That's correct. Again, in Ray's comments, yeah, Ray said at 10 million per quarter it's a $40 billion top line business today. Sameet Sinha : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Naved Khan with SunTrust. Your line is open. Naved Khan : Yeah. Thanks very much. So pretty nice subscriber growth and I guess if I look at the commentary you talk about also sort of improving the renewals. So just wanted some additional color on how much of the growth is really been driven by improving retention versus just higher gross additions? Ray Winborne : Hey Naved, it\u2019s Ray. I would tag more of that improvement to retention. You know Scott alluded to in the last couple of calls with the customer experience that is part of it, right. How our customers are experiencing the product that flows through the site, the interactions with the customer care center. All of those things are helping with improving retention, particularly with our longer life customers. Naved Khan : Okay. And then a little bit of housekeeping. So, CapEx was kind of a spike in the fourth quarter, how should we think about it for 2018? Ray Winborne : Yeah. I think as you look forward Naved, it\u2019s the timing from a quarter-to-quarter spikes at times, but continue to look at 3% to 4% of our GAAP revenues your target for modeling purposes. Naved Khan : Perfect. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan from Barclays. Your line is open. Deepak Mathivanan : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions, two questions. Sorry if you\u2019ve discussed this in detail before, just been jumping between multiple calls here. The new tax reform creates some constraints on tax deductibility from interest expense at certain scale; does that in any way change how you think about capital allocation with respect to leverage levels and potential M&As? And then the second question is with the scale of the domains business you have already and given that domains is an important on ramp channel for you, do you think there is still a lot of runway left to drive customer growth in mid-single digit over the next few years or should we expect to see you know customer growth driven by other products increasingly? Thanks. Ray Winborne : Hey Deepak, it\u2019s Ray. I\u2019ll take the first one on the new tax reform. From an interest expense deductibility, longer term it could affect our capital allocation, but certainly for the short and medium, just not a big impact on us, given our - both our structure and our tax position. Rate was really the biggest impact on us. And relative to your question on customer ads and in the role of Domains, Deepak, I mean I think the first point is the domains is still a strong onramp and we continue to bring in millions of customers, new customers every year into the franchise with Domains as a foundation. And as we add product capability hopefully these other onramps are also starting to contribute. In some ways, GoCentral and Domains are inextricably linked in a lot of ways and so that's certainly helping. And as you point out other product categories, certainly offer potential and that's part of the strategy over time is to add a couple of complementary product categories that might be able to bring in new customers into the franchise as well. Deepak Mathivanan : Right. That makes sense. Thanks guys. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Jason Helfstein : Thanks. Again, apologize if you covered, this jumping around. But is there any impact for a full year free cash flow for Main Street Hub, I saw you gave the revenue impact, but is there any \u2013 any free cash flow impact? Ray Winborne : Hey Jason, its Ray. Yeah, the $40 million in annual run rate on the revenue, they were a negative cash flow business. That's a combination of scale and customer acquisition cost. That dilution is built into the guide on unlevered free cash flow that we gave. Jason Helfstein : So, I mean, can you help us understand what that drag is? So, excluding that would you have actually taken up free cash flow guidance for the year? Ray Winborne : Yeah, that absolutely would have been a higher guide. But I'm not going to get into the specifics because you know we haven\u2019t closed the acquisition yet, it'll be back half of the year. Jason Helfstein : Right. And then just if I look at the, the kind of the operating segments, it was a very kind of clean and consistent quarter kind of very consistent with last quarter. I'll be at a slight acceleration in domains you know. Is there anything you'd call out is, is, is driving that in domain? Ray Winborne : Yes, yeah Jason as, as I mentioned in the call comments there\u2019s a pretty broad strength across the board. With domain specifically, there was a slight step up there, but you know that was the diminishing impact of purchase accounting that I mentioned to an earlier question. Jason Helfstein : And then just last for me. Do you have any impact on ASC, the, the new the ASC rule change? Ray Winborne : Yeah, so no impact on us for our need neither our recognition or our reporting, the other two big potential impacts for us would have been domains. We differ currently and we'll defer under the new standard as well and then our relationship with Microsoft on O365 we are a principal to that customer relationship today and we will be under the new standard as well so fewer changes expected with the new standard. Jason Helfstein : Okay. Thank. Operator : Your next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Good afternoon. I had a question just relating to the organic versus international growth. And I just, I want to make sure these numbers are correct. I think the implied organic was 12% in, in the fourth quarter and I believe you said ex HEG that the international business was drawing low double-digits. And I'm just curious you know why the international business may not be growing faster, we do think given the base that, that could grow at a much quicker rate than the over \u2013 overall organics. So, I just wanted to make sure, I heard that correct? Ray Winborne : Yeah, Brent, you\u2019re \u2013 you heard it correct. And that\u2019s the second quarter in a row we've seen a little slower growth there on a constant currency basis in the organic business. But again, when you look under the covers, it was a tougher comp against 2016. We've moved through that now. So, as you look out into 2018, you're going to see that growth kind of bounce back to what we were at prior to the last couple of quarters. So, underlying nothing to be concerned about there. If you look at the overall results, we're ahead of our expectations. So, some of the revenue coming in across the business, it will ebb and flow on geo\u2019s and we expect that to bounce back in this year. Brent Thill : Okay. And a question for Scott. When you look at the business apps, you have a long list of strong portfolio of solutions, but I think the one thing that many have noted is just that the absence of bundling similar to what Microsoft did with Office or others. Is there a planned initiative that you feel like you can take in 2018 around stronger bundling solution that can potentially ease the adoption for many of these businesses? Scott Wagner : Hey, Brent, well, so on business apps, I think the priority, if you're thinking about productivity is to make sure that in a really clean and easy way, we can introduce in a branded e-mail and productivity solutions to our customers. And if you're new, you can see that in our purchase flow and the linkage between a name and getting branded e-mail and us, we you done a I think a very good job of that and its actually putting attachment in a pretty elegant way now. Now bundling is a merchandising offer, but if we move towards subscription, then it gets pretty interesting. Where today these are still discrete products, but for certain segments of customers, you can absolutely see a world where you have site email and a domain name tied together for a certain price point. Now we're working on that and there is some underlying platform technology to do it, but that's a focus. And you could take what I just described on those big three and extend it to a whole bunch of other products as well. That is a 2018 effort to be able to not just merchandise them together but at pure customer, activate, manage and have all of those three products really operate as one. And that's kind of what's coming next. Brent Thill : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Brian Essex : Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I think you may have talked about the impact on revenue, but as we look at bookings understanding we're not the last kind of annualized HEG acquisition, how do we think about sequential growth in bookings through the year as current bookings may include obviously some - some renewals of bookings have written off at the acquisition? Ray Winborne : Hi, Brian. It\u2019s Ray. I'm not sure where you're coming from, from bookings being written off. That was more associated with revenue. Your bookings are what stayed relatively steady. So again, if you're looking at the business from an organic standpoint, even with HEG that bookings number is more pure. Brian Essex : Yeah. I was getting it deferred that may \u2013 that may be look a little bit skewed when you add deferred revenue written off in the prior year, and now you're renewing that. So, look I guess it may look new. And then on the \u2013 on the migration to the cloud, I mean how do you anticipate obviously you haven\u2019t kind of linked that agreement yet, but how do you anticipate that might impact your margins near-term and long-term as you kind of enter into that agreement, integration expenses notwithstanding? Ray Winborne : Yeah. So just take the one-time aside for a second, Brian, which we are accounting for in that guide we gave you. From a margin perspective, obviously, you'll see a degradation there, because it's going to come from capital up into operating expense, but you should see an offsetting reduction in our capital. And so, over a longer period of time, we\u2019d expect this to be accretive to margins as we move there. Scott Wagner : Yeah. So, Brian, the punchline remember it\u2019s uFCF kind of if that mix just boards itself out through uFCF, and our guidance this year includes all of our planned work already go into the cloud. So, what we're talking about it, but for modeling purposes our guide includes everything that we think we're going to be doing this year related to our infrastructure. Brian Essex : Understood. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from James Cakmak with Monness, Crespi, Hardt. Your line is open. James Cakmak : Hi. Thanks. Just one high level question. When you guys kind of frame yourselves as the one-stop shop solution for businesses, now you added the social marketing component to it. I guess where do you guys kind of draw the line on what much beyond is too being a one-stop shop. I guess where is line on what being a one-stop-shop. Like what -- I guess where is the line on you know what services you wouldn\u2019t enter and because just thinking about it as in terms of deals and potential additional services that you could add. So I mean you know where does it \u2013 where is the line, just wanted to understand that? Scott Wagner : I think the relevant -- James, maybe I\u2019d answer with a different cut which is if you look at what our customers are trying to do in the variety of products or services that they\u2019re paying other people thousands of dollars to provide, our product roadmap is about logical extension from our strengths and our strength is right now online presence. 17 million plus customers around the world work with us, we have the honor of serving them today focused on presence which is your name, your site and branded email. And you can think about a category like security for example or email marketing or what we\u2019re doing in social media as natural adjacencies from those three points in the online presence triangle and our strategy has been super purposeful around the great in a way and what we do today which is online presence and then continue to expand from there in ways that are distinctive and meaningful for our customers. And that has been the way we\u2019ve been thinking about it and certainly will be for the future. James Cakmak : Okay. I guess naturally putting it was more around you know where do you know that you\u2019re not diluting the focus of the business, but that\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Mark Mahaney : I guess two questions. First, when you think about HEG and the potential revenue synergies, just draw out and where do you think you are in terms of generating those? Is that whiteboard beyond whiteboard already in numbers multi-year and multi-quarter, just help us think about that going both ways. And then just a little more color on international, I know you talked about the growth there. That seems relatively positive but are there particular international markets you would call out in the past I think you've talked about we've seen really nice momentum in Asia. Could you just update us on that? Thank you. Ray Winborne : Hey Mark, on HEG, revenue synergy, I would characterize the revenue synergies in two different buckets. The first is product and merchandising where we're building a global product portfolio and then we're merchandising it together. And I would say that those are far along. This is a scale of 1 :10, we're kind of a 7.5 right now and it's driving that confidence and saying we're add or going to exceed our revenue synergy or the targeted synergies that we put out. More broadly, EMEA in general, Europe's an attractive market, we've got a pretty big business there overall, but when you get into individual countries, there's still room to grow and the fundamental premise behind the HEG combination was to get us more heft and scale and a couple of other geographies and allow us to maybe up our presence in a few more markets. And really, we're -- I'd say we're on the 1 :10 scale there, we're at a 2 maybe a 2.5, which is in a draw on the strengths where HEG is and we're going to work it in the same manner that we've worked global expansion and hopefully continue to evolve from there. And on your second question on Asia, could I just ask you to give me a quick repeat, I\u2019m not sure I totally got the full context of it. Mark Mahaney : Hey. Sorry, Scott. It was a real imply question, just as an update on traction in Asian markets? I know you spend a lot of time, a year ago kind of localizing for those markets a lot of effort into that so just an update on how you\u2019re faring? Thank you. Scott Wagner : Yeah. Thanks. Yes. Well, so same we localized everything in 2016 and sort of 2017, we then started to spend some amount of dollars into the market, and I think we had said Asia was low-single-digit percentage of our revenue. And a couple other markets in Southeast Asia where we\u2019ve started to put our shoulder against where we\u2019re seeing nice growth that kind of looks like India in the very early days which is great but we\u2019re big enough now that that level of growth isn\u2019t necessarily showing up in the P&L per se but it\u2019s just about continued to grow our footprint. So anyway, but the punch line is that we\u2019re happy with kind of where and how Asia is evolving. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thank you, Scott. Scott Wagner : Yeah. Thanks, Mark. Operator : At this time this concludes the Q&A session for the conference. I\u2019ll now like to turn it back to Scott Wagner. Scott Wagner : Hey, everybody. Thanks a lot. Thanks for your questions and being with us and for those of you who are coming to our Investor Day in late March we\u2019ll see you then. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

On today\u2019s call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and operating metrics such as total bookings, unlevered free cash flow, net debt and ARPU. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents maybe found in the presentation posted to our Investor Relations website at investors.godaddy.net or on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC with today\u2019s earnings release. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, which include those related to our future financial results, new product introductions and innovations, our ability to integrate recent or potential future acquisitions and achieved desired synergies, including our recent acquisition of HEG and our proposed acquisition of Main Street Hub. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, May 8, 2018 and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. Unless otherwise stated, when we refer to organic measures, we are referring to those measures excluding the impact of HEG and Main Street Hub. I will now turn the call over to Scott. Scott Wagner : Thanks, Christie and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We are pleased with our strong start to 2018, with first quarter revenue up 29% and un-levered free cash flow growing even faster, up 42%. As we discussed with many of you at our recent Investor Day, we are seeing consistently solid growth and executing on a strong road map in 2018 with particular focus on driving towards a best-in-class customer experience, increased product breadth, expanding our go-to-market approach and deepening the capabilities of our platform and our technology. Since we shared a detailed overview of our strategy and specifics on our plans and progress at our recent Investor Day, I\u2019ll quickly touch on them here and otherwise keep my remarks brief. We want GoDaddy to be known as the place where ideas start, grow and thrive online all around the world. And we know that what we do for our customers really matters. And if we get that right, we can be a key catalyst in the success of our customers\u2019 businesses, ventures and ideas. Our strategy is about fulfilling the promise of our customers\u2019 ideas through great products, a seamless end-to-end experience and meeting our customers wherever they are in their life cycle through our go-to-market efforts. And the opportunity ahead of us remains enormous, whether it\u2019s addressing the needs of new customers or in expanding what we do with our over 17.5 million existing customers. Each of the five individual elements of the strategy we shared at our Investor Day and the underlying roadmap are powerful alone, but the combination is what\u2019s compelling. Our strategy wraps together in a way that we believe has the potential to deliver something great. Perhaps you can think about it as the how, what and where of our engagement with our customers. Let me flesh that out a bit. First, we have been talking this year about our intensified focus on customer experience. This is about investing in how our customers engage with us through all the different touch points they have with GoDaddy. Whether our customers experience GoDaddy through our marketing, our website, our individual products and dashboards, our customer care reps or any other channel, those experiences should be delightful and feel incredibly consistent. This investment in customer experience extends across everything we do. For example, we are looking at unique ways to engage with our customers, including vertical merchandising, subscription options and solutions that group individual products together based on segment and vertical. Ultimately, we want to create simple, elegant, seamless experiences for GoDaddy customers. And over the long-term, we believe the benefits will show up in product activation, customer engagement, success, renewal and ultimately, in ARPU. Turning from how we engage our customers to what we do for them, the second pillar of our strategy revolves around our product portfolio and we continue to innovate there, building on existing products and technology where and how we can extend our products to meet our customers\u2019 needs. We are pleased with the momentum of GoCentral and we are also addressing the expanding needs of our customers in a world where having an owned website is really just the start. A truly complete online presence includes a consistent appearance across not just a website, but social media, listing services and more. Our recent acquisition of Main Street Hub is an example of how we intend to do more to help customers manage their brands across multiple online points of presence, including social media, ensuring that they\u2019re showing up everywhere they need to be online. I mentioned the how of customer experience and the what of our products. The third block of our strategy is our go-to-market efforts. That is where both new and existing customers see GoDaddy. Over the last 5 years, we\u2019ve proven that our product and go-to-market models work all around the world, and international expansion will absolutely remain a key component of our growth. We have an opportunity to expand our brand so that GoDaddy stands for online success globally. And we\u2019ll add both spending and capability to have more conversations with our existing customer base, which we believe will also translate ultimately into ARPU. And all of this investment in customer experience, products and go-to-market is underpinned by our single technology platform. The fourth and fifth blocks of our strategy focus on the platform and technology that power everything we do for our customers. Our platform is built to allow all of our product applications and marketing tools to work better together and provide a highly performant, secure infrastructure and environment. We\u2019d encourage everyone to spend some time with our Investor Day materials on our IR site for a deeper dive into our strategy and road map. As I wrap, I want to emphasize that while we are focused on delivering results in 2018, the majority of our efforts this year are about building a business that can deliver in 2019, 2020 and the years to come. We are proud of the consistency of our execution to-date, and our strategy in our investments, are intentionally longer term. We have got a good business and we are well positioned to grow it and evolve in meaningful ways and the numbers are showing up. And with that, I will hand it over to Ray. Ray Winborne : Thanks, Scott. I will cover three points on the financials today. First, we are executing well, delivering consistent growth on the top line and solid growth in customers and ARPU. Second, we are getting solid margin expansion through operating leverage while continuing to invest in the business. And third, the highly cash generative nature of this business creates financial capacity that positions us well to pursue value-creating opportunities. On my first point about our top line, revenue grew 29% to $633 million, including a $69 million contribution from HEG. Excluding HEG, organic revenue was up 15% versus last year, reflecting a nice sequential lift from the Q4 growth rate. Roughly 1 to 2 points is incremental growth in aftermarket domain sales, with the remainder attributable to stronger performance across the board. There were three primary drivers of the sequential increase in HEG\u2019s revenue, the seasonal boost from World Hosting Days, a series of events primarily held in Q1, a modest currency tailwind and the diminishing impact of purchase accounting as revenue normalizes to reflect the run-rate of net bookings. Looking at our two revenue drivers, customers grew 17% to $17.7 million and ARPU rose 6% year-over-year to $138. A straight ARPU calculation would yield an increase of 11% this quarter to $145. Remember, HEG closed immediately after Q1 in 2017, so we have adjusted our ARPU calculation for this quarter, so it includes both HEG\u2019s revenue and customers for the entire annual period to more accurately reflect ARPU growth versus last year and the anticipated trend line going forward. Our total bookings were $783 million for the quarter, growing 25% year-over-year, benefiting from similar factors as revenue. On international, revenue came in at $227 million in Q1, growing 69% year-over-year including the contribution from HEG. Organic growth returned to the high-teens as anticipated as pressures have subsided from currency headwinds and geographic shifts in aftermarket sales. Our international business now represents over a third of total revenue at a more than $900 million annual run-rate. We are in over 50 markets around the world with leading positions in many key markets, positioning us well for continued strong growth. Turning to my second point on cash generation, un-levered free cash flow grew 42% in Q1 to $162 million. That\u2019s over 200 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion, bringing our cash margin to over 25%. Our scale is driving operating leverage and producing strong flow-through on incremental top line growth. Organic un-levered free cash flow growth was solid as well growing in the 18% to 20% range year-over-year in line with our longer term expectations. On my third overall point about the balance sheet, we finished Q1 with approximately $730 million in cash and short-term investments. That put net debt at $1.75 billion or about 2.7x net leverage on a trailing 12-month basis. We have de-levered by over a full turn since acquiring HEG a year ago. Our long-term focus remains on driving strong and consistent cash flow. As we highlighted at the recent Investor Day, we expect to build significant financial flexibility in the coming years through growth in cash flow and borrowing capacity and we remain committed to being thoughtful stewards of capital, driving attractive growth in levered free cash flow per share for our investors via internal investment, acquisitions and share repurchases over time. So, let\u2019s discuss our outlook for Q2 and the full year. Given the strong Q1 performance and outlook for the remainder of the year, we are raising our full year revenue guidance to $2.62 billion to $2.64 billion, representing approximately 18% growth at the midpoint versus 2017. This includes the anticipated contribution of roughly $10 million per quarter in the back half of the year from Main Street Hub. As a reminder, we have now lapped the acquisition of HEG this quarter, so growth for the remainder of 2018 will reflect the diminishing impacts of purchase accounting each quarter. Cutting through the impact of acquisitions, we expect organic growth for the full year 2018 of roughly 13%, which backs out the HEG contribution in Q1, the impact of purchase accounting last year and the expected contribution of Main Street Hub in the back half of the year. Turning to Q2, we expect revenue in the range of $640 million to $645 million, reflecting approximately 15% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. Q2 last year included an $11 million reduction to revenue from purchase accounting related to HEG, so the underlying growth this year is closer to the 13% full year organic growth I highlighted. Turning to cash flow, we are raising the midpoint of our un-levered free cash flow outlook by tightening the range to $615 million to $625 million. That implies 25% year-over-year growth. Note that our un-levered free cash flow expectation for 2018 absorbs the Main Street acquisition while also creating some capacity for investment in the customer experience and some of the new moves in branding and conversational marketing we discussed with you at Investor Day. Just a reminder that our cash flow guidance includes total cash tax-related payments in the $25 million to $30 million range comparable to 2017 and excludes a one-time tax payment of $24 million associated with the gain on the sale of PlusServer last year. Stepping back, we continue to create franchise distinction and competitive advantage with proven execution and a business capable of delivering double-digit top line and 18% to 20% growth in un-levered free cash flow. With that, I will turn the call back over to Scott. Scott Wagner : Thanks, Ray. We look forward to continuing to deliver against our strategy, growing the business both this year and long term all around the world. Thanks everyone for your time and we are ready to open the call to your questions. Operator? Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Mark Mahaney : Great, thanks. Could you provide a little bit of an update of the AWS decision, the rollout plans of the cloud migration? And then maybe not just on the cost side, but maybe in terms of additional business opportunities that, that could create for you. And I know that\u2019s only a month or two since you last talked about it, but any update on your thinking on that would be great? Thank you. Scott Wagner : Yes. Sure, Mark. First and foremost, the rollout and the logic around it, is having a fantastic global, high-performant infrastructure that we can use for our applications and experience. Boy, we are in the early days and this is going to be a multiyear journey and so really no meaningful commentary to speak of in terms of the economic rollout. It\u2019s super early and we are just starting that transition, both for us using the AWS infrastructure and for some of the GoDaddy products to hopefully get deployed into the Amazon experience as well. Mark Mahaney : Thank you, Scott. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Pfau with William Blair. Your line is open. Matthew Pfau : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping to just get a little bit of an update on the international business and specifically around HEG. How has cross-sell been going into that customer base and what has retention been like there? And then also now that you have more feet on the street there how has the growth rates been in HEG\u2019s core markets in Germany and the UK? Thanks. Ray Winborne : Hi, Matt, it\u2019s Ray. I will start and I will let Scott come over the top if he has got anything to add. We have been very pleased with the results that we have had out of HEG. And actually, it\u2019s GoDaddy EMEA. We are running those together now. So, the merchandising and marketing and operations are all being run as one unit. The growth rates have been as expected there and we are continuing to make great progress on the integration. And then lastly, these synergies that we had projected are being delivered. So overall, very pleased with the results there. I don\u2019t know if, Scott, you want to add anything around customers, but... Scott Wagner : Growth is nice across EMEA. And again part of the opportunity for us is to take what\u2019s a pretty large footprint in the UK and then build off HEG\u2019s \u2013 niche brands in Germany and be able to accelerate really the GoDaddy footprint across Continental Europe. And so in addition to the cross-sell and retention efforts that you described really we are working on, first, a global product portfolio; second, a consistent care model into EMEA and then, third, what\u2019s going to be more and more presence across the continent in terms of go-to-market that hopefully over time will show up and it\u2019s going to be focused against the GoDaddy brand. We are happy with where we are. Matthew Pfau : Great. That\u2019s it for me, guys. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sam Kemp with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Sam Kemp : Great. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on a really small quarter. So Scott, at the Analyst Day, you made a pretty compelling case that GoDaddy has got a large opportunity to expand the product set they are able \u2013 that you are able to sell into your customer base and the different ways you can serve your customers. And then I am just \u2013 the one slide that\u2019s coming to mind has got like several dozen different product ideas that you guys are going after. If you think about the remainder of 2018 and then the early 2019, can you just call out what you think are the kind of key products that you can address in the near-term? And then secondly any particular reason that the aftermarket has been strong in Q1? Scott Wagner : Thanks, Sam. I am smiling with your question. I think that page in the market landscape has gotten a lot of attention from a lot of different parties. I think in any specifics, I\u2019d actually like to go back and highlight really the things that are underway on a couple of levels. One is the combination of GoCentral and extending GoCentral, which is making a ton of great progress around a DIY website building platform, but then the promise of integrating it to social media both on a DIY basis and now in combination with Main Street Hub, just those two things coming together are something that I am incredibly excited about that and I think we will deliver differentiated value frankly in the world. And maybe a category that doesn\u2019t get as much attention, but is something that we have talked about a bit in the past is security. Obviously, that\u2019s a topic across technology broadly. And one of the nice things GoDaddy has always done is had some security services, primarily in SSL around protecting websites, well, over the last, really, 1.5 years, we have leaned into security both \u2013 not only site backup, restore, but also malware scans through our acquisition of Sucuri. And those products are doing really well against particularly our existing base. And I think the nice thing about that product is that, that\u2019s a focus on doing more with our customers over time and again helping do more with customers that are already in our portfolio. Turning to your aftermarket question, why was the aftermarket strong in Q1, I will let Ray answer that one. Ray Winborne : Hi, Sam, it\u2019s Ray. Nothing in particular around the aftermarket, as we highlighted at the Investor Day, we are continuing to build on that product and seeing just good solid momentum, little bit of a softer comp for the first quarter. And as we have told you guys in the past, right, this is more of a transactional business in nature, so it can be a little bit lumpy. We don\u2019t expect this site same contribution the rest of the year, but we do see domains continuing to grow at a double-digit rate in 2018 and back to our longer term guidance of 1x customer growth as we look longer term. Scott Wagner : That\u2019s right. I\u2019d add on that nothing special, just again continued evolution of our strategy to help customers get great names, whether they are new names that are unclaimed or facilitating transactions around names that are already held. Sam Kemp : Awesome. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Lloyd Walmsley : Thanks. You guys talked about your kind of de-levering and increased financial capacity. Can you give us an update on just your thoughts around use of capital between acquisition versus share repurchase versus further de-leverage? And I guess as a follow-up to that when we think about M&A, can you give us some thoughts on how you see opportunities between like larger buys like HEG versus more product acquisitions like Main Street Hub and what looks more likely in the near term? Thanks. Ray Winborne : Hey, Lloyd, it\u2019s Ray. I will take a shot at this and Scott can come over the top. But our focus right now was just continuing to finish the swing on bringing HEG all the way into the fold. And then obviously we have got Main Street Hub lined up for the back half of the year and when we look at M&A obviously, I think we have got the financial capacity there and we have also got the operational capacity. You saw an announcement today where we are bringing Betsy Rafael into the management team to help us on the scale there. So, it\u2019s going to add another quiver. Operationally, we have got a business system that enables the integration. Our products are APIable. We have got a global tech platform that\u2019s capable of scale. And with the leverage that you mentioned, we should be at a point by the end of this year where we can do either product tuck-ins or larger acquisitions like HEG. As far as use of capital, that\u2019s going to be the primary strategy, but obviously, you have seen us do share repurchases. We did a 7 million share repurchase last year alongside a secondary and that is another option for us. Lloyd Walmsley : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark May with Citi. Your line is open. Mark May : Hello? Can you hear me? Scott Wagner : Yes. We got you, Mark. Mark May : Okay. Sorry about that. Sorry if I missed this, but in terms of the international business, I know you disclosed the organic growth ex the acquisition, but wondered if you could give some color on what the international revenue growth looks like on an organic basis and maybe also on a currency neutral basis. And then also in terms of marketing and advertising expense, the ratio was up around 100 bps versus Q4, maybe kind of what\u2019s your expectation going forward in terms of pushing the pedal on marketing and maybe being a little less efficient in the near-term, but for growth purposes? Thanks. Ray Winborne : Hey, Mark, it\u2019s Ray. I will start with the international and Scott will pickup the marketing question. Organic growth in international bounced back as we anticipated. It\u2019s in the high-teens. FX was relatively neutral, very small positive impact there. So we have seen exactly what we were expecting as a return to growth there, because as I mentioned to you on the last call, that business has been growing in the mid-teens. So, we saw a little bit of a pickup, so happy about the progress we are making there. Scott Wagner : And on marketing, I think for the next couple of quarters, you should think about marketing at a similar percent of revenue as the last quarter. But remember, everybody, we don\u2019t look at marketing necessarily as a percent of revenue, we look at it as a return on a lifetime value. And at the Analyst Day, we showed the 5-year difference in our unit economics, where approximately 5 years ago, the average customer was worth about $500 and we were bringing customers into the franchise at $50. Well, flash forward to today when the average customer\u2019s worth $700 and we are bringing people into the franchise at about $65 to $70. We have accreted a hell of a lot of value to our franchise on our unit economics. And from a marketing standpoint, we\u2019re not only using marketing as a way of initiating conversations with new customers, but we\u2019re also doing more, again, what we call more conversational marketing, which is ramping up both our spend against our base. Because with our richer product portfolio, more touch points in a logical way, there\u2019s opportunity to do more with our existing customers as well. And that\u2019s going to be an increasing focus of our marketing effort that we\u2019re going to continue to measure, still look out on a highly perform and return basis, but it\u2019s new activity that really builds on a lot of our successes over the last 5 years. Mark May : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Sterling Auty : Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. I wanted to follow-up on the earlier question on the domain business. You mentioned the double-digit growth for the full year, but obviously you got the big tailwind from the growth in the first quarter. Just kind of curious how should we think about the trend line of that growth? Do we quickly tail off into single-digit? So blended it\u2019s double-digit for the full year and then single-digit from here out or is there more seasonality to it than that? Ray Winborne : Hey, Sterling, it\u2019s Ray. No, I think you should think about that comment as second quarter through fourth quarter, right, taking out the noise of the first quarter. So we are seeing double-digit growth there. Just want to help you guys as far as the modeling. Sterling Auty : No, that\u2019s great. How much of that would be FX benefit? Ray Winborne : There is not a significant amount of FX built into that. Again, stepping back with a fun fact, there is a significant piece of our international revenue in bookings that are U.S. dollar currency. And we also put in hedges on our bookings. So, it mutes the impact of FX pretty significantly. Sterling Auty : Alright, great. And then one follow-up question on the business apps, strong results in the quarter, anything different in terms of the mix of business apps or anything you are doing differently from a pricing perspective? Scott Wagner : I think the success continues to reflect our differentiated value proposition around productivity both Office 365 and GoDaddy\u2019s Workspace product and boy that continues to be a big need in the world that we are satisfying. And although the numbers are getting really, really large, we are growing nicely, that\u2019s still the big driver of our business applications growth. Ray Winborne : Sterling, the only thing I\u2019d tag on there is my point in the commentary that World Hosting Days is also in that line item. It\u2019s a seasonal event that HEG holds. Sterling Auty : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Brian Essex : Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I was maybe just \u2013 if I could touch real quick on total bookings and I apologize if I missed in the prepared remarks, but substantially stronger than we had over The Street as well. I was just wondering in terms of puts and takes, how am I to interpret that strength and expectations for the rest of the year, particularly as it translates into kind of that organic growth number, maybe a little bit lower than 1Q out for the remainder of the year? Ray Winborne : Brian, so the trend is absolutely following exactly what you have been seeing, right. We have been pretty explicit on the revenue growth and we haven\u2019t generally been guiding on bookings, but you should expect that growth rate on bookings to continue to be pretty strong there, but to tick lower than the revenue growth throughout the rest of 2018. Beyond the HEG purchasing accounting impact, there is really no one driver. I think if you look at a lot of the customer experience initiatives we are putting in place, they are having some potential short-term impact on bookings growth, but for the longer term growth health of the business, these are the right things to be putting in place, so continued strong growth right in that organic range that we were looking at. Brian Essex : Got it. Maybe if I could just follow-up on the leverage, incremental margins in the quarter were much better, particularly on operating leverage side for SG&A. How might we, I guess anticipate seasonality, I guess specifically into 2Q? I mean, is IndyCar going to be a substantial blip on the sales and marketing front maybe the rationale around \u2013 maybe, Scott, if you can just touch on the cost benefit analysis that went into that, because I know I am going to get asked? Ray Winborne : No, Brian, but I don\u2019t think there is anything to point out from a seasonality standpoint on operating leverage. We are continuing to get good leverage out of several line items in the P&L. And yes, as far as the marketing dollars, it\u2019s insignificant in the size spend that we have got on an annual basis. Scott Wagner : Yes, and you gave the throwaway on IndyCar. I mean, actually, relative to our totality of go-to-market spend, the dollars are not big. And I think what we are happy about is, here in the U.S., Danica Patrick is going off and pursuing her next act on several of her ideas, and we have been able to help her and help message that and it totally fits on brand with an entrepreneur and a terrific businesswoman going off to do something, her next wave of ideas and we are helping her do that. Brian Essex : Got it. Thanks a lot. Thanks for clarification. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Jason Helfstein : Two questions. So, U.S. revenue growth was accelerating on attach rate and product suite, when you think about into 2019, how sustainable in the U.S. do you think kind of call it that growth is? Can you maintain mid-teens next year in the U.S. or could you get there? And then the second just given the acquisition of Weebly and what it looked like, it was purchased for not a very high number, can you talk about what you are seeing as far as rationalization in the present sector, which should benefit you through lower amounts of competition spend? Scott Wagner : Hey, Jase. Yes, it\u2019s Scott. So first, on the U.S. accelerating growth and sustainability into 2019, we\u2019re happy with the momentum of the business right now. Boy, if you asked us to look ahead, I think our guidance around low double-digit rates on an organic basis is still the way to think about it. But obviously, the momentum of the business is ticking along nicely. But I think, if you were asking about 2019, the growth rates that we laid out at Investor Day are kind of the goalposts that we\u2019d still put out there for everybody. Related to Weebly, I think I\u2019d answer that as we\u2019re really happy with how GoCentral and the capabilities have evolved, particularly over the last 18 months. And when we think about a website connecting both to social media and to other applications, which is really what online success is all about, I\u2019d say that, that\u2019s something that we are happy with our value proposition today. And even more importantly, we are leaning in to building a truly differentiated position on those levels going forward. And so regardless of other options, it\u2019s a fragmented space. Many people can win and we are just focused on doing things that are highly valued to customers and distinctive for them. And if it does it will workout well for us over time. Jason Helfstein : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Grant with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Mark Grant : Great. Thank you and congrats on a great quarter here. Just a couple of quick ones. On GoCentral and on the customer acquisitions you saw in the quarter obviously, it was a strong quarter for net-adds. And with GoCentral, are you seeing those customers coming in, are those net new to GoDaddy or are you seeing more of a mix within the customer base using GoCentral coming over from maybe domains or hosting and presence? And then can you give us a sense of how GoCentral did in terms of its contribution to the outperformance we saw in the quarter? Scott Wagner : Hey, Mark, it\u2019s Scott. In terms of net adds I think the big conclusion for everybody is that our messaging and product capability around presence and online success is continuing to capture our leadership position in just a pure domains on-ramp and we are both finding some amount of new customers that again in the totality of the millions of new customers we get every year is still a small percentage of our customer base, but it\u2019s a contribution. And so again the nice thing is the product is complementary to our core domains business, which kind of makes sense, because presence and names are inextricably linked. In terms of the contribution to the business and the trajectory, it was a whole bunch of drivers of strength and really it wouldn\u2019t be appropriate to highlight any one particular thing. It\u2019s market footprint and attachment around a couple of different products, of which GoCentral is one, but it\u2019s really the totality of the business system. Mark Grant : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your last question tonight comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Thanks. Scott, on the ARPU double-digit growth ex-HEG, I think we had to go back into our model to like 2014 to find that type of growth. How sustainable is this? Can you just maybe walk through what you are seeing that\u2019s driving that ARPU strength? And I have a quick follow-up. Scott Wagner : Yes. Hey, Brent, boy, remember \u2013 and I think we called this out in the release, the 11% doesn\u2019t have the HEG customers in it and when you normalize for the HEG end customers, which is sort of the pure ARPU number, it\u2019s 6%. So, the 6% number on ARPU is really the true apples-to-apples one, which we are happy with, but is really kind of the trend level and trajectory that we have been running at for a long time. Brent Thill : Okay, that\u2019s great. And then just as it relates to some of the packaging and bundling around a broader suite, can you bring us up to speed on that how you think about that rollout this year? Scott Wagner : Yes. I think we are continuing to maximize the \u2013 what we have called the attachment model, which kind of you see today, if you go on to GoDaddy and look in or experience us, it will be one product leading to another. I think the promise of what we are starting to build-out our solution-based experiences that will bring in name, presence, e-mail together in one solution deployed against a vertical. Those are things that we are \u2013 we have engineering and product people working on those experiences, but you are really not going to see things certainly show up in the business results or the P&L in 2018, but we have teams working on those kinds of experiences that again are all focused around solutions not for independent products, but really a totality of a bundle that will get people either up and running online or gosh, if you have had an online presence that\u2019s 10 years old and you need to make it over in a mobile social world, doing so in one clear value proposition. So, punch line is we got teams working on it, you might see elements of it over the next several quarters, but again those won\u2019t be things that are going to totally show up in the P&L this year. Brent Thill : And if I could squeeze one last one and given I am the last one in line. One of the questions we have been getting is just around payments now that Square has taken approach. Are you committed to just continuing the independence and being open, even working with Square despite their change in direction, what they are doing with, with that acquisition? Scott Wagner : Yes, absolutely. We have got a growing and mutually beneficial partnership with Square. We will absolutely work with Square. We are partnered with them. We are partnered with Stripe. All around the world, we work with other merchant processors. Back to the value proposition, we think a lot of our customers are early in their lifecycle are 17.5 million customers that we are focused on having applications around online presence. Boy, if you are a payment provider, we are a hell of a platform and ecosystem in which to operate. And so people like Square who are downstream from us we will continue to work with them and over time keep adding value to our service and work with Square and a whole bunch of other people who are in categories like payments that connect to our platform and ecosystem. Brent Thill : Great. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Sameet Sinha with B. Riley. Your line is open. Sameet Sinha : Yes, thank you very much and I apologize if this question has been asked, but can you speak about Main Street Hub, last time, you had elaborated on kind of a strategy once the acquisition closes, a strategy around productizing some of their offerings. Has that process already started and if you could provide us some insight there? And secondly, wanted to touch on SmartLine, it\u2019s been a few quarters since you launched that and what are your thoughts in terms of that becoming an on-ramp for the company and how is that scaling? Thank you. Scott Wagner : Hey, Sameet, thanks. So on Main Street Hub, the promise and the strategy is to wrap their capability around social media listings management, reputation management and combine it with GoDaddy\u2019s capabilities around websites and really deliver this promise and value proposition of a complete online presence, but we are in the very early days of putting teams together and integrating operations. And so we are excited about the promise. We think the Main Street Hub team is terrific. And we are thrilled and excited going forward, but its super early days. So there is nothing really of substance to share with everybody. It\u2019s more focused on, boy, hit the ground running once we close on July 1. Ray Winborne : Hey, Sameet, it\u2019s Ray. On SmartLine, the value prop for that product is still there, right. Our customers want something to solve that pain point they have got in their businesses and ventures. Is it where we want it to be? No. The customers that are using it today are using it more and more, but we have still got work to do as far as the customer on-boarding experience as well as the performance of the app to get it to a place where we are really happy with a full launch. It\u2019s still basically a beta launch scenario at this point, but still had a lot of optimism about the product and where it fits into the product suite. Sameet Sinha : Excellent. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Your line is open. Ron Josey : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. So I just want to follow-up on maybe Brent\u2019s question earlier and Scott, your point on selling more solution experiences. Coming out of the Analyst Day, I thought one of the key takeaways was just your ability \u2013 increasing ability to target the existing, call it, 17.7 million users with all the products you offer, but one of the questions we often get is sort of what\u2019s giving you the ability to really figure out and target those digital signals of those 17.7 million users, so that you can you go after those specific experiences so you can up-sell? Is it the new tech platform, like what is it that enables better targeting of consumers and up-selling? Thank you. Scott Wagner : Yes. Thanks, Ron. Yes, it\u2019s several elements that we use the platform, which is certainly a broad and encompassing word. But first and foremost, it\u2019s both our data infrastructure, piping and then analytic ability, both from sophisticated machine learning models around behavior and connectivity of what customers are experiencing. And again, remember, 17.5 million customers, right, all over the world, that\u2019s a fairly sophisticated data infrastructure. And then you start to get to just the interconnectivity of both our touch points like our website or communication modalities, whether it be e-mail or text or care, which is really our martech stack and our individual product applications and really the connectivity of those via APIs and operating as a system. And so if you think about the data layer, not only from an engineering standpoint, but also the analytics on top of it, we have built real capability there, not just to have data but turning into actually actionable insights. And then products that have APIs connected together with a whole martech stack that works together allows you to actually say, boy, one single purpose of an event that is a recommendation for a customer is what we are capable of doing today and that\u2019s one of the things, like you said it excites me and it excites us to be able to do that. Ron Josey : And would you say that these \u2013 can you just give us some timing as to when you are able to, I mean, obviously, you have always had the data infrastructure, but bringing it all together, is this a new capability over the last call it, 18 months, 12 months, 36 months, and now you are able to sort of step foot on the gas? Thank you. Scott Wagner : Yes, this is \u2013 I think it\u2019s capabilities that have been built particularly over the last, I would say 18 months. And at Investor Day, we shared some of the logic around, gosh, how are we actually then going to talk to existing customers and it\u2019s starting to show up. And marketing spend, it\u2019s still a small percentage of both marketing dollars and spend. But like everything, we are going to test, return, we have return thresholds around activity or spending levels and those are happening real time. And we will continue to go into the roadmaps for 2019 and beyond. Ray Winborne : You have heard Andrew say this, Ron, at the Investor Day. This is something that\u2019s very difficult, right. You are taking a move that we have been using for a long time to broadcast at all customers and really trying just to get this down to customers in smaller, smaller groups in the hundreds instead of millions. Scott Wagner : And from a quantum of marketing dollars, if you think about that this is still small, right, single-digit percentages of our marketing spend, but like everything we do, we are going to start \u2013 we will start small, get a value proposition and build from there and ramp. Ron Josey : Thanks, Ray. Thanks, Scott. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Naved Khan with SunTrust. Your line is open. Naved Khan : Yes, two questions. So, I think on the Main Street Hub, I think you are expecting roughly $10 million a quarter run-rate contribution on the top line. How should we be thinking about the cost side of the equation and its impact on the free cash flow earning guides for 2018? And in terms of the international performance, it seems like as a whole, it\u2019s performing better and I think HEG certainly is \u2013 I think is starting to do better. How does the rest of international look like outside of HEG? Ray Winborne : I will take the first question, it\u2019s Ray, on Main Street. Yes, $10 million a quarter is what we have baked in for revenue. And as we mentioned when we announced the acquisition, it\u2019s slightly dilutive to cash flow and that\u2019s all built into the guidance that we gave you guys. I don\u2019t think you should be expecting any dramatic synergies, either on the top or the bottom line for Main Street Hub in \u201818. This is going to be something Scott talked about putting together a more wholesome offering for presence with this product set from Main Street over the next year, 1.5 years. Scott Wagner : I will add on international outside of HEG. International continues to grow nicely. I mean, I think Ray mentioned it earlier it\u2019s the high-teens. On organic growth rate, we are looking at high-teens annual growth rate percentages and it\u2019s broad-based across geographies. Naved Khan : Thank you, Scott. Thank you, Ray. Scott Wagner : Thanks, Naved. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Kessler with Raymond James. Your line is open. Aaron Kessler : Yes, hi, guys. Sorry if I missed it. Just on COGS, it was a little higher than expected. Was that just mix or how should we think about maybe COGS going forward like cost of revenues? And then stock-based comp just any thoughts there, how we should think about stock-based comps for the rest of the year? Thank you. Ray Winborne : Hi, Aaron, it\u2019s Ray. I will take that. The gross margin ticked up a bit this quarter. HEG is a big piece of it, where it\u2019s just a historically higher margin business. They contributed a large portion of the incremental revenue lift this quarter. And then beyond that, it\u2019s just a continued shift in product mix away from domains in the core business. And as I have mentioned on previous calls, I would continue you guys \u2013 continue to encourage you to model that in the mid-60s range plus or minus just to give us that flexibility around gross margin from a product perspective and whether we build by partner or whether we do different pricing strategies, what we are trying to drive are gross margin dollars. We are not as focused on percentage and we want to drive the most out of the business that we can get there. On stock-based comp, we manage equity issuance based on annual grant value and we have been targeting a relatively modest burn of 2% to 3% of dilution. Over the past few years, obviously, we have been adding to the workforce. You have seen those grant values go up. And you have also seen dilution remain very low relative to the growth in the market capital, so happy with where that is. The expense is just an outcome of the growth of the grants that we have been making. Aaron Kessler : Got it. Great. Thank you. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters. Scott Wagner : Alright. Hey, thanks everybody. Thanks for joining us today and we will see and talk to everybody next quarter. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Christine, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the GoDaddy Q2 2018 Earnings Call. All lines will placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Christie Masoner, you may begin your conference. Christie Masoner : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for GoDaddy's second quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today are Scott Wagner, Chief Executive Officer; Ray Winborne, Chief Financial Officer; and we're welcoming Sam Kemp, VP of Investor Relations and Strategy. We'll share some prepared remarks, and then we'll open up the call for your questions. On today's call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and operating metrics such as total bookings, unlevered free cash flow, net debt and ARPU. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents may be found in the presentation posted to our Investor Relations website at investors.godaddy.net, or on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC with today's earnings release. The matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements, which include those related to our future financial results; new product introductions and innovations; our ability to integrate recent or potential future acquisitions and achieve desired synergies, including our acquisition of HEG and our recent acquisition of Main Street Hub. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, August 2, 2018, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. Unless otherwise stated, when we refer to organic measures, we're referring to those measures excluding the impact of HEG and Main Street Hub. I'll now turn the call over to Scott. Scott Wagner : Thanks, Christie, and thanks to all of you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter results. At quarter end, we've grown to serve 18 million customers, and we're pleased with the consistent execution this quarter while we continue to make progress against our long-term strategy to make GoDaddy the place where ideas start, grow and thrive online. We have a distinctive value proposition, and we're continuing to execute on driving towards a best-in-class customer experience, increased product breadth, expanding our go-to-market approach and deepening the capabilities of our platform and our technology. Today, we'll spend time on three particular topics : First, the continuing evolution of presence and how we're extending our products to meet our customers' needs, including our Main Street Hub acquisition and progress in our GoCentral website builder. Second, our go-to-market strategy, namely our progress in conversational marketing and end-to-end customer experience. And finally, Ray will cover our continued financial execution. To my first point, I'd like to start by extending a warm welcome to the Main Street Hub team, which officially joined the GoDaddy family in early July. The definition of what it means to have a great online presence continues to expand. Domain names and websites are, in many ways, the foundation of the Internet, and their functionality and importance is evolving in a couple of meaningful ways. First, given the proliferation of social media platforms, online content needs to exist and to be managed across many more places. And second, product applications, which used to be stand-alone point solutions such as social media and reputation management, bookings engines, SEO services, blogs and e-mail marketing are all increasingly being integrated together into a singular online presence and offering. Main Street Hub accelerates our ability to offer customers a do-it-for-me branding and social media engagement tool which combines dedicated teams of branding experts with proprietary workflow technology to help customers manage activity across all sorts of popular social media platforms. Turning to our GoCentral website builder, we continue to accelerate our pace of innovation and go-to-market strategy. We've recently launched a range of new features designed for customer success, including Square inventory management, robust class scheduling tools, Facebook integrations for sharing products via social media in addition to our customers' websites, as well as dynamic recommendations to help customers drive more traffic and bookings to their site. We've done all this with GoCentral while achieving high customer satisfaction scores and increasing the number of published sites in the hundreds of thousands. And we continue to drive higher free-to-paid conversion and improved cohort retention. We're seeing strong momentum with increasing service and product commerce adoption, increasing mobile end-to-end editing and publishing and customers upgrading to premium packages. I also want to touch on the ongoing evolution of our go-to-market strategy that we began sharing at our Investor Day earlier this year. Over the last several years, as we've expanded around the world, we've proven that our business, and particularly our go-to-market model, translates well globally. In addition to continuing to acquire new customers, we're increasingly focused on leveraging our expanding portfolio of products to reengage existing customers through conversational marketing, that is talking to and reaching our existing customers and the early signs are encouraging. We're discovering that we can deploy additional marketing spend into many micro campaigns at strong incremental returns. One simple example was designed around the upcoming changes to Google's Chrome browser that will indicate those sites without SSL protection. Our campaign was centered around awareness of this change and the increasing importance of attaching an SSL certificate. The return was fantastic, driving a double-digit percentage lift in bookings per targeted customer, and we're in the process of scaling these campaigns. Now this effort is small enough in totality that it's not going to inflect our aggregate P&L this quarter or probably next, but we have sufficient proof points that this can and will become a meaningful component to our marketing mix and to our business model for years to come. We also continue to intensify our focus on customer experience. Whether our customers interact with GoDaddy through our marketing messages, our website, our individual products and dashboards or our customer care reps, those experiences should be delightful and feel incredibly consistent. We want to create simple, elegant, seamless experiences for GoDaddy customers, and over the long term, we believe the benefits will show up in product activation, customer engagement, renewals and, ultimately, in ARPU. And as I wrap my comments today, we continue to execute our strategy, enabling GoDaddy to be the place where ideas can start, grow and thrive online. We've been focused on innovating across our product portfolio, our end-to-end experience and how we engage with customers. And these efforts are showing up in our numbers. We're seeing consistent growth in the business, and we're building a franchise for the years to come. With that, I'll hand it over to Ray. Raymond Winborne : Thank, Scott. I'll touch on the financial results for the quarter and the outlook for the rest of the year. Revenue was $652 million in the quarter, and while we lapped the acquisition of HEG, we still posted a very strong 17% year-over-year growth. Roughly two points of growth were attributable to purchase accounting impacts in the prior year, and we also benefited from about one point of currency tailwind this quarter. We drove double-digit growth across all product lines and feel great about the trajectory of the business, with Domains continuing to outperform our expectations. International revenue came in at $233 million in Q2, growing 24% year-over-year on a reported basis or 15% excluding the favorable impacts from purchase accounting and currency. Our international business now represents over one-third of total revenue and is approaching $1 billion annual run rate. Bookings for the quarter were $754 million, representing 13% growth, more in line with the underlying revenue growth, as purchase accounting doesn't affect bookings. Moving to our key metrics. Customer growth was solid at 6.5%, bringing our global customer base to 18 million. We added 1.1 million net new customers in the past 12 months, continuing a longer-term trend. ARPU is now $142, an increase of 10% year-over-year, with growth favorably impacted by the effects of purchase accounting. ARPU grew in the mid-single digits on a more normalized basis, in line with our expected trend line going forward. Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter was $155 million, an increase of 15% versus last year. Through the first 6 months of 2018, we've generated $317 million in unlevered free cash flow, a nearly $70 million or 27% year-over-year increase, putting us on pace to deliver full year growth of 25%. Unlevered free cash flow margin was 24% in the quarter, reflecting solid flow-through and top line growth. With respect to the balance sheet, we finished Q2 with $829 million and cash and short-term investments, and net debt at $1.64 billion or about 2.5 times net leverage on a trailing 12-month basis. The highly cash-generative nature of this business creates financial capacity that positions us well to pursue value-creating opportunities, whether through continued internal investment, acquisitions or share repurchases over time. We delivered a really solid first half, driving great top line growth, investing for our customers and future growth and executing to deliver bottom line performance. With that, let me turn to the outlook for Q3 and the rest of the year. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $670 million to $675 million, reflecting 16% growth at the midpoint. This includes about two points of growth from the addition of the Main Street Hub business that we closed in July. Given the strong Q2 performance and outlook for the remainder of the year, we're raising our full year revenue guidance to a range of $2.645 billion to $2.655 billion, representing 19% growth at the midpoint. This includes $10 million per quarter in the back half of the year from Main Street Hub. Underneath that headline growth, we expect organic growth for the full year 2018 to be north of 13%, which adjusts for the HEG contribution in Q1, the impact of purchase accounting last year and the contribution from Main Street Hub in the second half of this year. We continue to expect 2018 unlevered free cash flow in the range of $615 million to $625 million, which implies 25% year-over-year growth at the midpoint. That reflects absorbing the cash burn associated with Main Street Hub while also creating capacity for investments in the customer experience, expanded business capabilities and an acceleration of branding and conversational marketing spend. As a reminder, our cash flow guidance includes total cash tax-related payments in the $25 million to $30 million range, which is comparable to 2017, and excludes a onetime tax payment of $24 million associated with the gain on the PlusServer sale last year, of which $21 million was paid this quarter. Stepping back, we feel great about the consistency of our results, which reflect the power of our strategy and execution and, importantly, our opportunity to drive sustainable, double-digit topline growth and 18% to 20% growth in unlevered free cash flow. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Scott. Scott Wagner : Thanks, Ray. We're excited to have Main Street Hub on Board and look forward to continuing to deliver against our strategy, growing the business this year and long-term all around the world. Thanks, everyone, for your time, and we're ready to open the call to your questions. Operator? Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Ugam Kamat : This is actually Ugam Kamat on for Sterling. Regarding the revenue beat in the quarter, most of the upside seems to be driven by the Domains line of the revenue. How much of the Domains strength actually came from aftermarket sale? And what percentage of your current Domains business does your aftermarket represent? Raymond Winborne : Hi, Ugam. It's Ray. Obviously, the aftermarket strength has continued into the quarter. We highlighted our change in merchandising that we put in place in the first quarter. So we've been very happy with that growth. But there's also upside in there from good renewal performance. We continue to see upticks on a basis points basis there. And our unit growth in international is also contributing to that growth. So it's a mix of factors across the board. And as far as the size of aftermarket in context of total, it's still high single digits as a percentage of total revenue. So it has grown nicely, but it's still relatively small in the grand scheme. Ugam Kamat : All right. And as a follow-up, you're increasing your guidance revenue for the full year, but you are keeping your guidance on free cash flow that. Is it because you are expecting a higher contribution from Domains, which is a lower-margin business that's come back to hosting and business applications? Raymond Winborne : Less about the contribution from the top line, more about reinvesting back into the business. It's easier to invest, obviously, when you got wind at your back, and that's what we're doing now. We're accelerating some investments. You heard Scott mention it earlier his call comments around conversational marketing. We're also putting money into product expansion, platform enablement as well as some back-office capabilities for future growth. Scott Wagner : Yes. Ugam, it's Scott. I'll just reiterate that comment of, yes, if you look at the unlevered free cash flow growth for the year, it's mid-20%s, right, which is a nice healthy flow-through from topline growth to bottom line. And what we're seeing on both our product portfolio, the customer experience, efforts like conversational marketing is proof points that there are things that are totally working here. And we want to create the capacity to be able to feed them for the next several quarters. Ugam Kamat : Perfect. Thank you, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Jason Helfstein : Thanks. So just first, we noticed deferred revenue was down about 300 basis points relative to the ratio last year. And so could you just talk about like what dynamics hit deferred revenue in the quarter? Also, I don't think I heard any impact to currency, if you could share that. And then, I guess, the last - did you spend less on marketing in this quarter than you expected? And then last one, if you do not announce a large acquisition in the second half, should we assume you'll repurchase stock then? Raymond Winborne : Hey, Jason. It's Ray. I'll take the first couple and let Scott touch on the marketing. With respect to the deferred balance, I think the noise you're probably seeing is in the prior year with purchase accounting, in the way the acquisition of HEG impacted that balance. Be glad to take it up in detail with you offline. Currency impact, I highlighted in my comments. It was about a point of tailwind on revenue and a similar impact on bookings. So we're seeing a little bit of tailwind now, but that has actually turned in the third quarter. It's looking more neutral year-over-year. Scott Wagner : And to your marketing point, Jason, yes, on the face of the P&L, our marketing growth, obviously, was less than revenue growth. But per my comments on opportunities that we're seeing, we not only counsel everybody but, frankly, look towards having marketing spend grow at the rate of revenue growth or hopefully, as we flow into next year, even faster where we're able to put marketing dollars onto the field that drives great long-term returns. So yes, on the quarter, it was a point of P&L deleveraging, but that wouldn't be the way to think about it going forward. Raymond Winborne : Yes, and finish up with your last question around share repurchases, we're constantly looking at capital allocation. Back to the guidance we've given you guys pretty consistently, number one is organic growth. We're going to continue to invest in the business to drive that. Two is M&A, and that can take different flavors, whether it's a product tuck-in, geographic expansion or consolidation. And third priority at this point is share repurchases. We want to save the powder for those first two growth opportunities first. So nothing definitive to put to you whether we would pursue a buyback, but it is definitely on the list of capital allocation. Jason Helfstein : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau from William Blair. Your line is open. Matthew Pfau : Hey guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask a few about GoCentral. First off, in terms of the improvement that you're seeing in conversion and retention, maybe just some more details on what you think is continuing to drive the improvement there. Scott Wagner : I think it's a combination, Matt, just of additional features that are continuing to add richness to the experience, but still creating a really simple overall toolset that people can use and get through. And how that shows up in the numbers as your published rates are terrific, and they continue to go up. At the end of the day, when our customers, whether it's GoCentral or even our other products, when they activate the products, whether it's being published or used, for the most part they get a tremendous amount of value from those products. And that's really the juice that drives not only renewal rates but then the flywheel of additional units being added over time. Matthew Pfau : Got it. And then just a follow-up on GoCentral, in terms of the uptake of e-commerce functionality that you're seeing. Just perhaps what's driving that? Is it improvements in the product? Or are you starting to perhaps attract a different type of customer that has more of a need for that e-commerce functionality? Thanks. Scott Wagner : Yes, thanks. And e-commerce, we'll divide it into two things. One is service commerce, and the other is product commerce where you're really fulfilling inventory. And a lot of our immediate gains, and where we think we're adding a ton of richness just almost week over week is in the service commerce realm, where, again, if you're a photographer, a personal trainer, you not only are able to book appointments on an individual basis, but increasing richness in class scheduling functionality, both outwards to members and even internally within a business. And you're going to see us connect that deeper and deeper into invoicing and payments. And even within product commerce, there continues to be richness within that product set that is allowing us to add more customers who are actually selling physical product than we've ever had. In the totality of our 18 million customer base, that's still a small number, but we're seeing really nice growth in both components of what you call an e-commerce. Matthew Pfau : Great. That's it for me guys. Appreciated. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Naved Khan from SunTrust. Your line is open. Naved Khan : Yes. Thanks a lot. Just a couple. It looks like the conversion rate on GoCentral continues to improve. I think the last time you shared a metric around that, you said it was mid to high single digits. Any updates on the conversion rate? And then just a quick follow-up on the growth in the second quarter. Was there any impact from the World Cup, if at all? Scott Wagner : I'll take those two. On the conversion rate, the conversion rates are still sitting in that zone, which I think, as you know, is really healthy. Right now, I encourage everybody who's listening to just continue to try the product on a regular basis, and you're going to see increased richness and capability not just now, but in the months to come. Right now, the biggest thing about GoCentral is just general market awareness about the capabilities of the product, and that's what we're going to go work on. In terms of the World Cup, no. No impact. Naved Khan : Okay, thanks. And then maybe a quick clarification, if I can sneak that one in. So the FX has obviously moved versus the last time you guided. How does it affect the full-year outlook for free cash flow and revenue? Raymond Winborne : FX is factored in to both our forward guide on revenue and unlevered free cash flow. I can tell you, at least historically, through the first piece here, the third quarter, it's pretty flat year-over-year. Naved Khan : Right. But for the back half versus the last time you guided, there is probably a little bit of adverse impact, right? Raymond Winborne : Tiniest amount. Yes. Naved Khan : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ron Josey from JMP Securities. Your line is open. Ronald Josey : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to stick with GoCentral here, but maybe a different question on like the product. So I think you're at scale. You talked about hundreds of thousands of websites, 1,600 verticals, I believe. But can you talk a little bit about the - so we can understand the effectiveness of GoCentral as one of the core on-ramps to the platform and maybe that's a big part of what we're seeing in Domains reaccelerating? And then, of all these features, Scott, you talked about with e-commerce, social scheduling, et cetera, are users adopting these features at sign up? Or after the site is up and running, they get more comfortable and then they highlight - then they sort of adopt these features based on your sort of customer marketing? Thank you. Scott Wagner : Yes. Thanks, Ron. So first, the nature of that question was around GoCentral on its own pulling in new customers to the franchise and what's the interplay with Domains. And I think what we're finding is these - those are complementary. So GoCentral is pulling in new customers who had never had a domain name and they're starting and building a site and then they're attaching a domain name on the back end of it. Equally, we continue to have people coming in and getting a name and then attaching GoCentral. And I think the combination of those two things, it's nice just that they're not really trading off from one another. And obviously, we're pretty happy with the net customer adds this quarter. Although, as we've said for a long time, we don't really manage that number on a quarter-over-quarter basis. It's an output, but it's an output of what we think is doing the right thing, which is, and this hits your second point, adding richness and functionality, creating a good experience, a great experience. And if we can get customers to the publish event and then having them interacting with us, generally not only are they staying but they're thrilled, and we're doing and helping them have their ideas be successful in the world. Ronald Josey : And as awareness of all these products that you're launching is so many, has that happened? How do you gain awareness and all? And that's it for me. Thank you. Scott Wagner : Well, now we're getting back to the marketing and how we're getting that message out into the world, Ron. And I think to Jason's question on marketing and how to think about that going forward, we're going to be continuing to, not only through dollars but also our messaging, add different ways that we're communicating and interacting with customers that isn't maybe necessarily about big mass media but hitting a whole bunch of different touch points, whether it's social media or whether it's different influencers, obviously, down to sort of low-funnel tactics. And those are going to be ramping up in the quarters to come because, as you point out, I think right now, there is a heck of a lot more capability in the GoDaddy experience overall than perhaps people might even be aware of. And well, that's a marketing challenge, and the nice thing is I think we can do that pretty well. Ronald Josey : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Hi Scott. The international business, 24% growth, looked great. I'm just curious if you could just break apart what you're seeing there and how you think about the bigger drivers as we look in the back half of the year in the international market. Raymond Winborne : Hey, Brent, it's Ray. And I'll let Scott come over the top on this. 24%, obviously very happy with that. I mentioned in my call comments, the purchase accounting had a little bit of an impact on that growth as well as some currency. The 15%, though, we are incredibly pleased with. It's very strong. That's across all of the regions, so we're seeing very good growth in each of the regions and continue to see a lot of opportunity there to continue to grow. It will - just another one of Scott's points in his comments about marketing spend, we'll continue to put branding spend against new markets as we move through the rest of this year and into 2019 to continue that customer growth. Scott Wagner : The only over-the-top that I would add is I think international is continuing to just move along and advance, really, at the same what I'd say is pace and progress for all the time that we've been a public company. And some quarters show up a little better than others, but I think what you're really seeing is a steady and consistent growth as we both build awareness and our customer base and our services in markets around the world. Brent Thill : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Lloyd Walmsley : Yes, I had a couple on GoCentral. I guess, first, if you look at these customers, how did the interplay there between those customers and the customer care organization look versus your more traditional customers? Anything kind of interesting, either performing better or differently than the traditional customer? And then as you see improving unit economics there with better activation and retention and upgrades, like what are you guys doing and how should we think of going forward, just scaling marketing spend behind that? Is that a big source of incremental marketing dollars, given the success you're seeing there? Scott Wagner : Yes. Hey Lloyd. To your first question, don't think about this as a different - something totally different related care or even the business system. And so to the specifics of that question, our care team interacts with our 18 million customers, and they're helping them with some things at some point in some time and helping them develop their ideas. And GoCentral is more capability that we're adding to the interaction that we have with our customers. So there's sort of nothing different there. I will say that one of the things we're working on with Care is doing new things and adding new capabilities of this still, frankly, unique asset and experience we have, which is real people being able to help not only with GoDaddy's products but others in the world. And so what we're doing on the Care side is adding, I think, richness into the support experience, again, not necessarily around GoCentral, but really unique ways that we can interact and help our customers, like migrating and completely making over an online presence that maybe was built five to eight years ago or making and scheduling consultation appointments for certain kinds of customers. Again, it's, how can we do some things that are different? So anyway, thanks for the question there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Barclays. Your line is open. Deepak Mathivanan : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Two questions. So first off, Ray, we've seen our aftermarket Domains sales contribute to upside for a couple of quarters now. Does this create volatility in your ability to forecast the business? What is kind of factored into the back half guidance currently? And then second question, we've lapped HEG, so can you give some color on the bookings growth at the core GoDaddy business? And if you don't want to be specific, is it fair to say that the core is growing at a faster-than-reported growth, given that HEG is a relatively slow grower? And then kind of along similar lines, was there any contribution to bookings from Main Street Hub in the second half? Or is it - I mean, sorry, in the second quarter? Raymond Winborne : Yes, let me start with your first one on the aftermarket. Obviously, we continue to see Street highlighted that in the second quarter, and it's bent off of unit growth. And I mentioned the merchandising change we made early this year. And while I'll tell you more of a transactional business than new registrations, we are seeing pretty consistent flow there. And so you've seen that reflected in our full-year guide. So we believe Domains will grow double digits for the rest of 2018. So that is sustainable in there. Your second question was around core GoDaddy bookings. The 13% bookings growth this quarter is pretty consistent with what we've been printing. So nothing to point out there between core and HEG. And lastly on Main Street, we closed in early July so nothing reflected in the second quarter. That's all in the back half of the year. Deepak Mathivanan : Great. Very helpful. Thanks Ray. Raymond Winborne : Certainly. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark May from Citi. Your line is open. Mark May : Thanks a lot. I think most of mine have been covered, but maybe on customer care. You guys have seen some nice leverage there, especially this quarter. I don't know if some of the accounting has played into that, or if not maybe talk just a little bit about what's been driving that. Are you benefiting from maybe some capacity that you've added to the business recently and you're benefiting from that, or maybe it's more to do with the recent change in revenue mix? I know you mentioned aftermarket or the mix of greater portion of your revenue coming from recurring customers that aren't as taxing on the system. Just trying to get a sense of what's driven that, and kind of how you're thinking about that going forward. Raymond Winborne : Hey, Mark, it's Ray. There is some seasonality in the expense flow in Care. But I would tell you probably one of the single largest factors in the leverage we're getting out of that line item is some movement in capacity outside the U.S. We've mentioned that we've opened call centers in Latin America as we've scaled there now. That's a lower-cost location for those calls that we were serving out of the U.S., same with some calls we're moving into Europe that were being serviced out of the U.S. So we're seeing some rate benefit there. But again, I think you should expect that line to move around on a quarter-to-quarter basis as we put investment in on [clips]. Scott Wagner : Two - hey Mark, if I could just add two things that are important here. When Ray talks about moving capacity around the world, it's actually to serve customers in those markets. So Latin America, for example, as we've opened up centers there, its serving customers close in, in a manner which reflects their local context. And so that's what we're trying to do. And so we're actually seeing better service, better customer interaction, which is the goal. And some of - any rate differences is sort of a - is a benefit. And I think you hit on something else, which I think reflects more of the spirit of what we're doing, which is as your product experience gets better and as we add richness to the product portfolio, the level of services that we have, several carry a little bit more monetization than products that we've particularly had in the past. And when you do that over time and those kinds of products renew, you'd naturally get a little bit of leverage into something like Care. Mark May : And I was going to ask a follow-up on trying to get a sense of product up-sell opportunity. And is it possible to identify maybe one of the products where you think you have a particular opportunity for up-sell in trying to scope how you think about the opportunity, like the percent of existing customers that don't have [x], but should, that don't have SSL certs, but you've identified they should? Is there any way of kind of picking one or two of your big opportunities there and trying to frame the opportunity from that perspective? Scott Wagner : Let's see. Appreciate the nature of that question, Mark. We've always - we've described the penetration of presence, for example, as being out of our customer base. A little over one-third of customers have an active point of presence, whether it's something they built on GoCentral or a WordPress site hosted with us. And its highest macro level, you could even go into that audience plus many of the other names that are held. And gosh, look at any site that was built five years ago, and I would say we could add a hell of a lot of value to all of those points of presence and all of those customers. Now that's a super big white space number, but I think, at its highest level, it's indicative of the potential that exists within our base. And then the example that I gave you in the scripted comments is a very specific one. And what I and we are particularly excited about is being able to get to that level of specificity because the only way you can actually reach out and engage with your base is being incredibly precise around your audience and having a specific idea for how to interact with them. And the SSL idea related to the Chrome changes is one indication of many, many different ways that we think there's something of value that we can - that we have and can do with our customers. So it's just a matter of reaching them in the right moment. Mark May : Great, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Essex from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Brian Essex : Hey, good evening, guys and thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if I could just hit on HEG real quick, like just looking back at the acquisition, it was a great result, and you've almost - I think you more than cut leverage in half following that. So the benefits are clear, I think, in terms of cash flow and margins. What's left there? And how do you - what are you working on in terms of HEG in - with regard to synergies, cross-sell, up-sell and then penetration of the European market? Raymond Winborne : Hey, Brian. It's Ray. I think we've gotten a lot of the work behind us at this point. Still opportunities on cross-sell and getting the product in, still opportunities to get the Care to a level that GoDaddy's at on the sell side of that. I think we've mentioned this before, the Care organization there from a service perspective was top-notch, great NPS scores. But we want to get that selling motion put into that program. So that's still something on the list that we've got to tick off. And as far as expanding out beyond that footprint, that's still a big opportunity for us. We've launched GoCentral in Germany today, and we're looking at markets outside of that to start putting branding money up against. Brian Essex : Got it. That's helpful. And maybe just a follow-up, what does the pipeline look like? And would you entertain levering up like that again? Or do you anticipate, given the fragmentation of the market, you're going to take off more kind of bite-sized acquisitions as we go forward? Raymond Winborne : Yes, I think if you look at the balance sheet capacity we've got, we're at roughly 2.5 times today. We continue to believe this business easily supports a two times to four times leverage. And I think if you're going to do the work, our opinion is go bigger, but you'll see us do both. You just saw the Main Street Hub we closed this quarter. I mean, it was more of a product tuck-in, but we'll be looking at consolidation as well as geographic expansion. Brian Essex : All right, very helpful. Thank you. Scott Wagner : Yes. Thanks for the question, Brian. I had just one comment on it. I think HEG, a year in, yes, you'd say we've hit every mark that we wanted to hit from a financial return and even the first level of bringing the businesses together. But we're - our aspirations are higher, and we're still building the real capability to have a single global product portfolio and have all customers on a single platform. And we're in the middle of really ticking and tying that work. And the nice thing is we can now ramp up our presence in many of the local markets in Europe. We can lean into growth while we continue to build those capabilities. It'll still be another six months to 12 months. And like you said on the pipeline, those capabilities, when we really got them down, open up a whole another range of things that we can do around the world that's not even this year or the next or even the following, but could stretch for five or 10 years. Brian Essex : Good start, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Grant from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Mark Grant : Thanks. I just wanted to follow-up on Brent's question on the international side. You mentioned there is strength across regions. But as you look forward, is there any region, whether it's Europe, Asia, LatAm, where you see a particularly attractive opportunity for investment, whether that's organic or inorganic, where you just see a better return on incremental investment for that next leg of growth? And then on Business Applications, you saw that relatively flat sequentially. Is there anything you'd call out there? And would you expect that to return to sequential growth in 3Q? Thanks. Scott Wagner : Hey, Mark. It's Scott. Let me do the first one. So the nice thing is that we really are seeing global growth. I'd call out two things. Europe, back to the HEG comments, when we look across the landscape in Europe and what it means to have an online presence. Gosh, I just - we see opportunity at every turn. And the art in Europe, obviously, because of the relative slower growth of markets and the difficulty of switching, it's all about having an activation point to go capture incremental growth. But the opportunity is there. And so you're going to see us, again, building in a prudent way but continuing to increase our go-to-market in Europe just because we think the value proposition we have there is fantastic. It's going to get better and better. The customer unit economics are wonderful, like just all of the fundamentals are really strong. And the only thing that we have to balance in Europe is just a relative rate of incremental growth and just having prudent levels of growth, given that. Asia is a totally different story where, just in several of the countries, we're just seeing nice, nice growth. And we're so early in our own market development presence there that the focus is really establishing GoDaddy as both a brand and a business. And a lot of the Southeast Asian countries - and when Ray talks about adding countries and adding spend, those are particularly focused on heaving up more and more and expanding in Southeast Asia. Raymond Winborne : Hey, Mark, it's Ray. On your biz ops question, we continue to see great growth in there in the high 20s year-over-year, strong up-sell on 365 adding seats. So that business is growing very well. The specific question around sequential really relates more to the first quarter than second quarter performance. If you remember, I highlighted World Hosting Days, which is a seasonal event that we'd picked up with HEG, kind of threw off the sequential growth, but it's very solid. Mark Grant : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Mark Mahaney : Great, thanks for sneaking me in. Let me see. Let me try three quick questions. At Slide 9 about the free cash flow margins, that nice kind of up and to the right margin trend, any new thoughts on what the long-term - your long-term free cash flow margins are? Secondly, you didn't talk too much about Amazon and the AWS. I know I asked about it last quarter. I'll just ask about it this quarter. And I know it's very early stage, but any new learnings, new thoughts on that? And then finally, I know somebody asked you about this before, Ray, but so I get the answer right again, you're raising your revenue guidance, but you're keeping your free cash flow guidance the same because you've got some new investment initiatives probably in product development spend and sales and marketing spend that you want to accelerate in the back half of this year. Am I capturing that right, why the revenue is going up, but why the free cash flow is not? Thanks. Raymond Winborne : Yes, Mark. Let me take a - just a couple of those and I'll let Scott touch on AWS. So with the margins, absolutely no change with our expectations there, we'll do 25% growth this year, and our longer-term projections are the 18% to 20%, so no changes in that - or the next couple of years. And then we think that can grow to the high 20s to 30% over time. As far as the free cash flow guide, you got it dead on. We're seeing upside on the topline. It's a great time to be able to invest back in the business, when you got a wind at your back. And it's several areas of investment we're trying to focus on. A lot of it is based off of Scott's comments of building for the long-term, not necessarily the next two to three quarters, but over the long-term, how do we get the business system put in place in order to take advantage of all the opportunities we see in front of us? Scott Wagner : And thanks for the AWS and Amazon question, Mark. We're absolutely starting the process of using AWS as a cloud provider, and there's a handful of product efforts that we're working with the AWS team on to incorporate some of the GoDaddy products and experiences into Amazon. Just because it's early days - I think I'd fired some of those back off at Investor Day, and we're working on the handful of, what you'd call, almost the easier ones, and we're super happy with the early relationship with Amazon and the work, whether it's using the AWS infrastructure or the level of engagement around how we can work together at a deeper level. But it's too early to talk about any one specific thing, particularly in the context of an earnings call, but we feel really good about what we're working on and the level of engagement. Mark Mahaney : Sounds good. Hey Scott, I'll keep asking every quarter, no problem. Scott Wagner : Thanks Mark. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Kees from Summit Insights. Your line is open. Jonathan Kees : Great, thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to ask about Domains. That's been a surprise last few quarters. It's been double-digits, and you're saying that, that should continue going into - in this year. Long-term, I mean, you set a - kind of a target of where it would start mirroring market growth, about one times market growth. Is that being pushed out now? I mean, is that more a longer-term target now in terms of Domain growth? And then, second, I just want to ask about - especially with HEG, if - what the GDPR or cost impact was from that. Thanks. Raymond Winborne : Hey, Jonathan. It's Ray. On Domains growth, it has been a nice surprise to us on the upside across the Board. Again, we're getting unit growth from expansion internationally. We're getting good renewal performance. Some of the growth you saw this quarter was the purchase accounting impact year-over-year. So that 16% is a little bigger than what you would expect, but we do see that continuing the rest of the year. What we have continued to counsel folks on, it's good for us, right? We've built that business in that category, but over the long-term, that growth rate should come back closer to one times our customer growth, which we continue to believe is going to be in that mid-single-digit range, this quarter 6.5%. And as far as GDPR cost, yes, we did invest, obviously, into systems to be prepared for that change. It's still early days as far as the regulation and what the long-term impacts for us, but it doesn't affect us like a lot of other the - other Internet companies you've been seeing because we don't monetize our customers' data. So we haven't, at least at this point in time, seen any perceptible impacts on customer impact - or customer growth, traffic or revenue. Jonathan Kees : Great, thanks. That helps. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Scott and Ray, I'll turn the call back over to you. Scott Wagner : Thanks. Go ahead, Ray. Raymond Winborne : Yes, Scott, I apologize. I didn't want to jump in front of you there. But one item before we close out, guys, is that our Q2 release today inadvertently repeated our unlevered free cash flow outlook language from the first quarter, so my apologies. Our intent will be to issue a corrective release and 8-K/A on that. Sorry. Go ahead, Scott. Scott Wagner : Yes. No, thanks. And everybody, thanks for the questions. Thanks again for the time on the call, and we'll talk to everybody next quarter. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Riley FBR Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray  Deepak Mathivanan - Barclays Lloyd Walmsley - Deutsche Bank Operator : Good afternoon. My name is Jesse, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the GoDaddy Q3 2018 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Sam Kemp, you may begin your conference. Sam Kemp : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for GoDaddy's third quarter 2018 earnings call. With me today are Scott Wagner, Chief Executive Officer; and Ray Winborne, Chief Financial Officer. Scott and Ray will share some prepared remarks, and then we'll open up the call for questions. On today's call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and operating metrics such as total bookings, unlevered free cash flow, net debt and ARPU. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents may be found in the presentation posted to our Investor Relations website at investors.godaddy.net, or on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC with today's earnings release. Unless otherwise stated, when we refer to organic measures, we are referring to those measures excluding the impact of HEG and Main Street Hub. The matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements, which include those related to our future financial results, new product introductions and innovations, our share repurchase program and our ability to integrate recent or potential future acquisitions and achieve desired synergies, including our acquisition of HEG and our recent acquisition of Main Street Hub. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, November 6, 2018, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.  With that, over to Scott. Scott Wagner : Thanks, Sam, and thanks to all of you for joining us today to discuss our third quarter results. We\u2019re in an environment where it's never been more important to take an idea whether it be a business, civic organization or community event and not only get that idea online, but to enable that idea to grow and thrive through an integrated toolset and experience. We continue to execute on our vision of making GoDaddy an indispensable partner for entrepreneurs as they create a digital presence that both drives their idea forward, and creates pride in their work.  Our third quarter results reflect our execution on that strategy with revenue up 17% year-over-year and unlevered free cash flow growing even faster at 28%. Today we will spend time on three topics. First, the progress we're making in our online presence applications. Second, an update on our customer experience, both frontline customer touch points and at the infrastructure level. And finally Ray is going to cover our continued financial execution.  But before we begin at a broad level GoDaddy is about ideas coming into the world and representing both our customers\u2019 ventures and their journeys in authentic and compelling ways. As part of that we\u2019re thrilled with our new partnership with Ayesha Curry one of the most successful food entrepreneurs in the world with over 7 million followers on social media. Ayesha is the perfect example of an entrepreneurial doer who started her business from scratch, juggling that and an active family. GoDaddy will be helping Ayesha launch her latest food related venture in 2019 and we\u2019re excited to be in a position to evolve our brand and customer experience together.  And while we\u2019re excited to be affiliated with known personalities and celebrity icons, we will also see that our messaging to the world celebrates our 18 million plus customers their ideas and their everyday entrepreneurial journeys as well.  Now moving to my first point on presence with GoCentral, the themes we shared with you last quarter have continued including improvements in mobile use, customer retention, free-to-paid conversion and rising net promoter scores. We\u2019re continuing to add significant features to the website builder and its broader application as an online presence engagement tool. We recently added Yelp as a partner for our expanding presence solution, making it simpler for businesses to create their Yelp profile and claim their business listing right from the GoCentral dashboard. We\u2019ve also added marketplace indications for product commerce to both post and sell products across Amazon, eBay, Etsy and other major marketplaces from a single GoCentral dashboard. As we partnered with these and other platforms we\u2019re building out a streamlined process to quickly add new points of presence allowing us to accelerate our pace and depth of new third-party integrations as we head into 2019. Another important development in our presence offering is our recently closed acquisition of Main Street Hub, which is our platform for assisted branding and social media engagement. We\u2019re four months into the integration. And while we still have a lot of work ahead of us, we\u2019re seeing early points of validation of our original acquisition pieces. We can bring a ton of know how to our customers with assisted services for both site building and social media management through this integration.  Ultimately there's real value in cultivating our customers instead of just selling to them. Remember everybody, part of the benefit and promise of GoDaddy is that we actually serve customers and we\u2019re just beginning to unlock the ways that we can help our customers communicate to their audience. In our early efforts we\u2019re seeing positive receptivity from our customer base and we\u2019re encouraged by the potential.  And that all ties into my final point on customer experience. While we often talk with you about what we provide to our customers that is our products and their feature set, we\u2019re making significant strides in our customer touch points align whether that be in our marketing, or website, or individual product components and flows across our care reps and other points of engagement. This is a combination of both big initiatives and a lot of blocking and tackling basics that we\u2019re seeing to lead the consistent improvements in success measures with GoDaddy's net promoter scores increasing significantly since we started this effort and customer satisfaction scores are at their highest in GoDaddy's history.  And while these frontline customer touch points are crucial we are also making substantial improvements to GoDaddy's platform and infrastructure, which is showing up in our ability to iterate on both our product and experience. With AWS we\u2019ve begun migrating workloads into the cloud on pace with our expectations and we\u2019re seeing the early potential around what it\u2019s able to do for performance, scalability, and flexibility. To give you one example of how this can change our speed, we recently deployed a product on AWS\u2019 infrastructure and cut two-thirds of lead times that we typically have. That's on top of allowing our teams to focus more on the underlying software and application performance versus the infrastructure capacity itself. Before I hand it over to Ray, I'd be remiss if I didn't take a moment to recognize Bob Parsons, GoDaddy's founder, who stepped down from our Board of Directors in October. Bob was a pioneer in the industry and built GoDaddy in true entrepreneurial fashion, throwing his heart and soul into a dream while taking big risks. GoDaddy is all about enabling entrepreneurs and people's ideas to start, grow and thrive and Bob continues to epitomize our customers. He is now devoting his attention to a wide range of new entrepreneurial activities. Personally, it's been a true pleasure and honor to get to know Bob over the last six years and I and we thank him so much for all his contributions.  With that here is Ray to cover the financials. Raymond Winborne : Thanks, Scott. I will touch on the financial results for the quarter and the outlook for the rest of the year. We delivered another solid quarter with great top-line performance and strong growth in unlevered free cash flow, while continuing to invest for the future, including closing the acquisition of Main Street Hub earlier in the quarter. On the top-line revenue came in at $680 million in the quarter, growing 17% year-over-year, or 14% excluding the impact of purchase accounting and Main Street Hub. Underlying growth was in line with the second quarter and reflects strength across all segments of the business with particular outperformance coming from domains on the back of strong registrations and aftermarket sales.  International revenue was $236 million in Q3 growing 19% year-over-year or 15% excluding the impacts of purchase accounting. Foreign currency headwinds were negligible on Q3 revenue. Bookings grew to $742 million rising 11% year-over-year, or 12% on a constant currency basis. Let me touch on a few things related to our bookings trajectory. First, as the US dollar strengthened midsummer, we saw currency flow from 130 basis point tailwind in Q2 to a 110 basis point headwind in Q3. That affect has obviously magnified in the international results.  Second, as we\u2019ve mentioned in the past, we are continually testing merchandising tactics to improve the customer experience and customer lifetime value. Some of these will impact bookings and revenue in the short-term but are good for the long-term health of the customer, and in turn, for our business. While this will show up in all regions it will likely show up more in international as we prefer to test and iterate within smaller control segments before launching initiatives more broadly. And finally, it was still a relatively small piece of our business that's been growing quickly. We are seeing some softening in China that led to a little less to 1 point of deceleration in Q3 total bookings.  Moving on to key metrics. Customer growth was solid at just under 7%, bringing the quarter end customer base to 18.3 million, including 8 million international customers. We've added 1.1 million net new customers in the past 12 months, reflecting a mix of strength in gross new customer adds and slight improvements in retention. ARPU rose to $145, up 9% year-over-year, with growth favorably impacted by the effects of the HEG acquisition last year. ARPU grew in the mid-single-digits on a more normalized basis. With lifetime customer value at 10 times the cost to acquire customers, our unit economics remain robust and our source of value creation for shareholders.  We\u2019ve been leaning into marketing spend, particularly as we find strong returns and conversational marketing where we are evolving our ability to more precisely target the need states of our customers present the right message and meet them in the right channel. Through this and other efforts, we\u2019re creating incremental capacity for go-to-market spend through both product on-ramps and spending into our base.  Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter grew 28% year-over-year to $176 million. Unlevered free cash flow margin was 26%, reflecting solid flow-through on top-line growth. One point on cash flow, you'll notice the CapEx was light in Q3, which was due more to timing of planned spend but we expect that to bounce back in the fourth quarter. We remain early in our transition to the cloud, and we don\u2019t expect to drive any meaningful leveraging CapEx in the near term. With respect to the balance sheet we finished Q3 with $852 million in cash and short-term investments, net debt landed at $1.6 billion or about 2.3 times net leverage on a trailing 12 month basis and we're on track to be at 2 times leverage by the end of the year, exactly where we said we would be a year ago. Our priority remains taking advantage of the highly cash generative nature of this business, first through internal investment, second through acquisitions, and third via share repurchases.  Given the strength of our balance sheet our declining leverage ratio and financial capacity, the Board of Directors approved an open-ended authorization to purchase up to 500 million of our Class A shares. We\u2019re going to execute this in a thoughtful manner so as not to constrain our ability to take advantage of M&A opportunities as they arise.  We\u2019ve had a strong year thus far, both in terms of top-line and bottom-line strength as well as investments we made in product, customer experience and our platform. So with that let me turn to the outlook for the rest of the year. Revenue as a result of strong third quarter performance and our expectations for the fourth quarter, we are raising our full year range to $2.655 billion to $2.660 billion implying full year growth of 19% at the midpoint. For full year unlevered free cash flow, we expect to generate approximately $620 million implying 25% year-over-year growth. That reflects the impact of cash burn associated with Main Street Hub and investments that we\u2019re making in the customer experience, expanded business capabilities and an acceleration in branding and conversational marketing.  As a reminder, on our cash flow guidance, it includes total cash tax-related payments of approximately $25 million, excludes a onetime tax payment of $24 million associated with the gain of PlusServer sale last year and excludes cash interest payments which we project will be approximately $85 million for the year. As we look to 2019 we feel great about the consistency of our results, which reflect the power of our strategy and execution. The framework of double-digit top-line growth and 18% to 20% growth in unlevered free cash flow that we provided to you at our Investor Day holds true for 2019. We see this is a healthy mix of run rate top-line and bottom-line growth plus investing for the future while continuing to create margins over time.  Obviously, the last couple of months have been choppy in the markets. From a GoDaddy standpoint, it's nice to provide mission-critical services for getting people's ideas online and making them great, which is a business that has the defensible advantages. And in an increasingly volatile world there is a stability and consistency with GoDaddy that hopefully resonates with everyone on this call.  Thanks everyone for joining us today. And with that, let's open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Grant with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Mark Grant : A couple quick ones from me. So if you could provide a little bit more color around what drove bookings in the quarter. You mentioned a couple of things and we saw change in deferred, are you seeing anything in your go-to-market that that is worth kind of drilling into there? And then on the conversational marketing side, you mentioned you\u2019re leaning into those initiatives and seeing some good returns. Can you talk a little bit about any potential impact to customer acquisition costs that you're seeing or I guess another way are those initiatives serving to improve customer growth, or is it more about driving intelligent upsell within the base? Thanks. Raymond Winborne : Mark I will start its Ray. I did highlight a few factors in my call comments on bookings. Yes there were a number of factors at play but the changes in subscription term due to product mix, and frankly decisions we\u2019re making around the customer experience were the key drivers. Shorter-term length is a conscious decision as an example, in many cases it result in a better customer experience. If you think about examples our multiyear renewals would be one where we\u2019d rather sell say a single year subscription, and have more renewal points when that comes around and they give you an opportunity to sell more products at a more frequent interval and a lot of times that serves the customer better as well. Scott Wagner : And it's Scott. Your second question, Mark was around just marketing and how to think about the cost of customer acquisition going forward. The bulk of our marketing still is focused around customer acquisition. But as you said we\u2019re spending more effort about talking to our base conversational marketing relatively tiny amount of spend, we\u2019re happy with it. We\u2019re going to continue to grow that aspect and notion for us, but it\u2019s still pretty small. If you look at our overall customer number Ray had mentioned, on a 12 month basis we\u2019re up 1.1 million customers, our gross new adds on a net basis for the quarter are good. So from a customer add standpoint, both on a gross level and the retention level we\u2019re happy with what showed up. As we\u2019ve mentioned, we don't necessarily manage to that number but we\u2019re happy with the customer both adds and retention. Mark Grant : Thanks and then Ray mentioned the shorter duration there. When you improve the customer experience as you mentioned, is that something that we can take as an indication that we might be able to see some improvement in that 15% customer churn number that you\u2019ve talked about? Raymond Winborne : Yes. Mark, over time we\u2019ve continued to see slight improvements in churn particularly in the more developed markets and so that's obviously where we\u2019re pushing every day to try to improve that and improve experience, improve the retention. Operator : Your next question is from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open. Jason Helfstein : Two question and apologize if it's covered. So I think there is a second quarter where bookings slowed down on a year-over-year basics ex-FX and as part of that we saw deferred revenue go down to 2% bookings which is obviously a big change from last year so same kind of pattern in the second quarter. So I guess, can you talk about is there more of a shift to monthly versus prepaid that\u2019s causing that and then as you think about the 12% organic growth on bookings, is that a reasonable rate going forward? And then I\u2019ve got down one follow-up. Raymond Winborne : Hey, Jason it\u2019s Ray, Mark had a similar question, and it is back to term as one of the key drivers there beyond FX and then the softening in China that I mentioned that both of those affect your change in deferred. So that is where it's coming from. And as you look at the longer-term, obviously we've seen call it 13% growth on revenue bookings has been slightly diverging from that and we\u2019re looking at double-digit growth as we move forward. Jason Helfstein : And then just a follow-up then for Scott. So should the company be increasing marketing spend to either add customers in existing markets or drive kind of higher usage higher ARPU from existing customers or do you think your capital is better spent on geographic expansion either organic or acquired? Thanks. Scott Wagner : Yes. Thanks, Jason. I think the answer is both right? We\u2019re still -- if you look over time we've accreted our unit economics and so the average customer add is still quite profitable. It doesn't mean that you chase the last incremental customer everywhere but a good customer who's coming in and is purposeful about getting an online presence, right website, domain name and connecting it to other applications around the world that is a phenomenal economic customer and so we\u2019re going to continue to focus on international expansion growth around that. The great promise for what we\u2019re doing is, obviously, can we fulfill the full suite of needs that the customers are going to have not only to start an idea, but actually have it build up over time, which is about how do we work with our own basic customers. So the answer is both and we are going to continue to try to be able to do both, but also within reason about how things flow through the P&L and through year. Operator : Your next question comes from Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Jonathan Lee : Hi. This is Jonathan Lee on for Brian. I wanted to dig in a little bit on Plasso, it looks like you may have acquired that business this past quarter. Can you add some color around what that platform is, what plans for it and how much demand you see for paying from the platform? Scott Wagner : Thanks for the question Scott. So for those of you who may not know what Plasso it's a start up in the digital commerce space and on what Plasso is going to allow us to do is accelerate three different use cases around commerce. The first is to be able to sell digital goods and downloads via the GoCentral platform. The second is to enable our customers to have subscriptions, paid membership and packages, again there are going to deliver to their own customers and audience. And the third is to be able to create really a unified payment system, again, that are going to be extended to our own customers. Think about it is a lot of the capabilities that GoDaddy might have and we\u2019re going to go try to help enable that for somebody who may only have a couple of employees. Again the focus for Plasso is going to be to build up the GoCentral platform. Although each of the things that I described can also be an asset and a plug-in to WordPress. So we\u2019re excited about having a Plasso team join us. Jonathan Lee : Appreciate the color. What\u2019s the -- I mean it looks like you\u2019re rebuilding the platform, is that correct? Scott Wagner : I\u2019m sorry, rebuilding on the platform? Jonathan Lee : You have rebuilding the Plasso platform on to your platform? Scott Wagner : It's going to just be integrated into GoCentral. Operator : Your next question comes from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Brent Thill : Ray just on the booking number, just the ongoing. But when you think about the shift away from year to shorter duration, can you just give us a sense of allocation of what customers are billing for yearly versus shorter duration, what the time line has been there? Raymond Winborne : Hey, Brian, we haven't gotten into that level of granularity in the disclosures but you if you look at the product mix that's driving a lot of it, particularly when you look at GoCentral it\u2019s more of a monthly product a lot of our WordPress products are monthly products and as those are growing and becoming a heavier piece of the mix and then we\u2019re using the Care organization in different ways as well. Some of those are multiyear in the past and we\u2019re starting to pull those in, again back to customer experience. Brent Thill : Okay, if you go to kind three causes I think there's a lot of focus on this metric this quarter, is FX the biggest headwind if you had to kind of allocate a headwind among those three factors, is that -- was that the biggest one that you would cite? Raymond Winborne : FX was the number one in the list. And then you\u2019ve got your China was almost 1 point in a slowdown and then the term is your other one. Brent Thill : In China you don\u2019t believe there's any -- that\u2019s more macro versus anything that\u2019s happening on the execution side from your perspective? Raymond Winborne : Yes it doesn't feel like it's a GoDaddy specific issue from what we\u2019ve seen. Operator : The next question comes from Matt Pfau with William Blair. Your line is now open. Matthew Pfau : Just want to follow up on HEG and if you can provide an update there? I know last quarter, it seemed like acquisition had been progressing as you had planned but you also sounded like there was room for improvement there as well. So maybe just an update on that business? Thanks. Scott Wagner : Thanks, Matt. Well I think it was -- we were happy with where we were and we were continuing to do the work, particularly the integrated into a global product portfolio and a single platform that work is going on. So again, good progress, so we\u2019re managing two plan, again, it's kind hit all of its basic metrics and the two priorities are single product portfolio that can be deployed all across the world. And then a global Care model with an integrated platform around it. And there is still work to do on it and we\u2019re -- that will last probably for the next several quarters, but it's moving along. Operator : Your next question comes from Naved Khan with SunTrust. Your line is now open. Naved Khan : I had a couple. So maybe just on the Main Street Hub acquisition. This was the first quarter you had it. Was the contribution on revenue and booking kind of in line with your expectation? I think you guided to maybe 10% -- $10 million a quarter kind of run rate. You did not have any kind of guidance about the contribution on bookings. How should we think about that? And is $10 million a quarter still the right way to think about it going forward until you relaunch it? Raymond Winborne : Yes. It\u2019s Ray, and that\u2019s exactly what you should be thinking about it, we called $40 million annual run rate on a quarter and it's dilutive on an EBITDA basis and both of those are true in the first quarter. And as we integrate the business we're seeing good progress as Scott mentioned in the call comments but it's going to be in the '19 before we start to see anything coming out of that run rate. Naved Khan : And any contribution on bookings from the Main Street Hub? A - Scott Wagner : Same as revenue, this is more of a monthly product. Naved Khan : Got it. Okay. And then a quick follow-up I had was just on the M&A front. I guess you're still sort of keeping that optionality open in spite of the announced buyback. Any updates on what the pipeline might look like now versus the last quarter? Raymond Winborne : I wouldn\u2019t comment on any specific target but if there are assets out there available you can assume we are looking at them. So it's still a strong pipeline. Scott Wagner : Yes, and the broader context, this is Scott, again we are operating one of if not the largest platforms for small businesses and organizations, not only to just get their ideas started, but hopefully build that up around the world and that creates opportunity for us to certainly integrate specific products and expand our geographic scope and we will continue to look at both and do so in a judicious way that\u2019s it's going to add value to our customers and to our position in the world and what we can deliver for them and we think there is going to be a additional opportunities for that. Obviously that\u2019s our priority and just given how the state-of-the-world right now we thought it would be prudent to also have the ability to do buybacks on a judicious basis. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Market. Your line is open. Mark Mahaney : You talk about GoCentral in the deck about continued solid adoption rates, could you quantify at all that ramp for GoCentral and then Scott just like the last two quarters any early comments on synergies with AWS? Scott Wagner : Thanks, Mark. In terms of GoCentral, so GoCentral shows up in our hosting and present line, which on an annualized basis is going to be about a $1 billion this year and so within that there are a variety of hosted applications that are growing, but obviously growing slower and GoCentral is growing much quicker. We\u2019re not breaking out the difference between the two but that's for split.  On AWS, in terms of using AWS for our own product applications again a quick example as we've cut lead times by two-thirds so our debt cycles by two-thirds the amount of time in terms of deploying product code into live into the environment and that's just fantastic for our speed and we\u2019re continuing to work with Amazon on a couple of different things and the GoDaddy's products into the Amazon ecosystem as well. Raymond Winborne : Hey, Mark when you think about the full transition of the heavier workloads, it's going to be a multiyear effort to Scott\u2019s point, what we're doing right now is getting the product development and the application development into the cloud, that's where we\u2019re really realizing the velocity and ease. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark May with Citi. Your line is open. Mark May : A couple please. On gross margins you\u2019ve continued to show nice improvement there I wonder if you can just quickly remind us what are couple of the main factors that are driving that and how sustainable do you think these improvements are? And then secondly you've had -- you've shown some nice leverage in terms of marketing and advertising recently but it\u2019s now down to like 10% or 11% of revenue or something like that and I'm sure you're payback periods are much shorter than what is probably acceptable, so I guess I'm just trying to get a sense for how willing would you be to extend those paybacks a bit kind of lean into marketing even in some of your more quote established markets in order to possibly test the market and maybe test growing the business a little faster than what you are at the expense maybe of short-term margins? Raymond Winborne : Great questions. It\u2019s Ray, I will start with gross margin then let Scott take the marketing. Gross margin ticked up a little bit this quarter after being relatively flat at 66% for the last year. All levels equal as we\u2019ve said in the past as the business continues to shift towards the higher margin software products we\u2019re going to see that drift up, but I\u2019d still caution you as I always do on this call not to model in accretion there because we will take that and move it up and down the P&L based off of different investments. Scott Wagner : Yes, and this is Scott, I will take the second one on marketing and thanks for framing it that way Mark. We would like to grow marketing, we would like to grow marketing faster than revenue as we head into next year I mean as everybody on the call I think really appreciates our aggregate return on our marketing spend is fantastic and we\u2019re looking at two places on how and where we can continue to grow that marketing spend. The first is around pulling new customers into the franchise. Again, if you look at the quarter's results our customer adds and retention and how they made it out were really attractive there and part of that is how and where we\u2019ve spent our marketing dollars really over the last both this quarter in the quarter before. And back to conversation on marketing, which is actually going and addressing our base, again we\u2019re seeing really nice signs of return there and that's something that we\u2019re going to scale up in 2019 and I think the nature of these two questions, which is gross margin accretion how much reinvestment into marketing is something that we've been managing really for the last several years as a public company which is putting dollars back into the business to grow our franchise again at attractive LTV economics and looking at the relative investment within different line items in the P&L accordingly, to still kind of have a really nice top-line growth and still accrete to the bottom-line. I think that the philosophy as we head into next year that we are going to go forward on. But again the idea boy can we lean into go-to-market spend a little harder? Yes we\u2019re looking for it. But again, we\u2019re economic enough that we\u2019re not going to get our skis, we will test, learn and when we find things that work we\u2019re going to pick it up. Operator : Your next question comes from Ron Josey with JMP. Your line is now open. David Scharf : Hi. This is David on for Ron. Just wondering if you can give us an update on the integration of Main Street Hub from GoDaddy lead perspective? Scott Wagner : Hey, David it\u2019s Scott. It were in the process of taking the Main Street Hub service which is social media and reputation management and introducing it into the GoDaddy base and we\u2019re seeing really nice return as expected around the introduction of that to a known customer base as opposed to in the wild, and really we\u2019re in that still early-stages of that journey but we\u2019re seeing -- what we're seeing basically what we would expect and now our work is to really take both website building, maintenance and social media, rapid altogether and have absolutely one offer and delivery system across both because that's the difference making thing in the world and in the market and we\u2019re kind of building that product and delivery experience. And if and as we do it's going to have fantastic returns on the sales productivity like we know that for a fact. Operator : Your next question comes from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Sterling Auty : So we've had a couple of quarters over the last couple of years where the term length has been out of my focus and just wondering with some of the comments you made, what's left, so in certain way to quantify and I know that\u2019s probably impossible, but what the average term length is or how much more impact could we see from further shifts in duration? Raymond Winborne : Hey, Sterling. It\u2019s Ray. Yes, you are right. This has occurred over time for different reasons and a lot of what we've been doing now is back to the improving that customer experience and therefore retention and what we're talking about is days, I don\u2019t wanted to make it sound like we've taken our term down by months or quarters, these are days but when you apply a shortening of days to the size base, it matters on a year-over-year growth rate. Sterling Auty : Okay, and one follow-up just may be any color in terms of the business application, revenue line item 26%, good growth but seem to be kind of tailing into that range, so you talked about in terms of the multiple times of domain growth. So just wondering what you're seeing in terms of O365 growth versus other contributions there? Raymond Winborne : Hey, it\u2019s Ray again and really pleased with the growth this quarter 26%, over a $100 million a year or a quarter revenue line item now and we will continue to see good growth coming out of O365 and penetration on units. In long-term we continue to see this line items not just productivity but as we add products in here drilling at 3x to 4x on a customer growth. So we\u2019ve been very happy with what we've seen. Operator : Your next question comes from Sumeet Sinha with B. Riley FBR. Your line is open. Lee Krowl : Hey, guys. This is actually Lee Krowl filling in for Sumeet. Just a quick question on something you mentioned in your prepared remarks. I mean you guys kind of talked about touching merchandising tactics internationally. Just on that front, can you maybe talk about whether or not the competitive landscape has changed internationally and maybe it's estimated perhaps a little more difficult to do these tests against a more competitive suite of products out there? Raymond Winborne : Hey, Lee, it\u2019s Ray. No, it is so fragmented when you get outside the US particularly in some of the smaller markets is where we test these merchandising tactics that it's something we absolutely do on purpose because we don't see the impacts from a competitive standpoint. Scott Wagner : I think more broadly, just thinking about standing in the world and how and what dynamics happening, I don't think there's anything substantively different. Yes, if you think about traditional web services companies I mean that is a fragmented array of different companies. At this point we love both entering and sort of taking presence in share from that audience all around the world. And if you think about just different geographies and obviously Asia, the adoption of Asia, it country-by-country looks a little differently in terms of social media platforms and how they relate to the open web, but our business in Asia-Pacific has been growing nicely for a while and there's certainly not only a role that we have to play but one that continues to offer growth for us. So at a macro level, there's nothing that I would say has necessarily changed in terms of the global either competitive dynamic or just the offer set. Lee Krowl : Got it. And then on the integration with third parties like Yelp and Etsy, can you just remind me what the fundamental implications are for things like that? Is it more of just a feature set to be a convenience to customers or is there a revenue opportunity there and maybe just the impact potential going forward? Scott Wagner : Well in terms of product commerce, it's relatively small today and that's a big opportunity for us to build it up and again if you think about commerce there's two big ways to do that, there is service commerce, which is your booking or billing or offering a subscription membership which is the vast majority of actually small business ideas and opportunities and that\u2019s something that we\u2019re growing really nicely and we do well today and we\u2019re really thrown in our shoulder against it even more and then the other is obviously product commerce, which is selling physical goods with inventory, which is sort of a different vertical on its own. And one of the things that we are just starting to release to small portions of the traffic is a way to take somebody\u2019s store and shopping cart within GoCentral's e-commerce platform and syndicate that to Amazon, eBay and Etsy right from GoCentral again to have one place where our customers in control of both their inventory and offer both at the open web and to the major marketplaces. So again that\u2019s small for us today, but we think it is really addressing the needs that most of the customers have. Operator : The next question from Michael Olson from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Michael Olson : Hey, thanks. Just since you mentioned it, what do you think is going on in China that\u2019s created a little bit of softening, is it overall market characteristics or competition or some sort of other specific change? And then may be while we\u2019re on international, you just mentioned a broadly fragmented market, but wondering if there are any particular countries, regions that you would call out as having the opportunity for kind of mostly near-term potential to impact the model in any material way? Raymond Winborne : Mike it\u2019s Ray, I will start off with -- it does look like it\u2019s anything specific to GoDaddy, I don\u2019t know if I would call out macro but we haven't seen what's behind it in China and again to Scott\u2019s point it\u2019s still growing very nicely. It was just going a lot faster in the first half of the year. Scott Wagner : And relative to markets and growth, there's nothing to really call out. I mean, if we back up over the last five years, there's been an evolution of customer adds around the world that has a big concentration in Europe, obviously we\u2019re picking up in Asia Pac, which obviously has a whole bunch of different countries with different make-ups there. But the growth algorithm from a customer adds standpoint internationally has been kind of solidly into the mid-teens. And that's the customer profile that we've been on for the last several years. Operator : Your next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan from Barclays. Your line is open. Deepak Mathivanan : Two questions. The first, the recent announcement on .com price increases potentially from the registry sites starting in 2020, is that something you would expect impact gross margins I know in the past you passed through registry cost to consumers, what should we expect for the .com side? And then second one, how big of the international business is in local currencies versus US dollars? Because even on the FX impact I know in the past you have made pricing adjustments to reflect US dollar trends, is that something that you tried or what is the bigger driver? Scott Wagner : Hey, Deepak, it\u2019s Scott, I'll talk to the VeriSign situation. For those of you who aren't aware VeriSign received the authorization from the NTIA starting in 2020 to be able to raise the price of .com as a registry by 7% and that amount today is $7.85 which has been that amount since 2011 and as Deepak pointed out the last time VeriSign took a price increase the industry passed that through to the end registrant, .com and more importantly the software around bringing somebody's .com to life is valuable and modestly we\u2019re providing the value in that relationship around taking a domain name and actually turning it into something that somebody cares about. And so we\u2019re focused on continuing to serve people in a great way with their idea and provide the real value in not just the name but around what you do with the name. Raymond Winborne : Yes, Deepak, it\u2019s Ray. So when you look at currencies it's turned into a slight headwind for us and truth is when you look at, roughly 70% of our global bookings are in the US dollar. And to your point when we see fluctuations in the currency -- local currencies, we do attempt to address it with pricing. You are not able to do that dollar-for-dollar in most cases and there is usually a lag. So we see some impacts there in the short-term. And then when you start talking about some of the things we've seen since late summer in some of the currencies as examples Turkey, Brazil, it's a pretty dramatic change in the currency. So you are not going to able to capture that with price adjustments. Operator : Your next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Lloyd Walmsley : When you look at kind of bucket of core products newer products at GoCentral or Main Street Hub and then potential adjacencies, what should we expect the focus over the next year or so in terms of relative focus? And then specifically on potential adjacencies, where do you see is the most interesting kind of potential adjacencies either organically or through M&A and how should we think about that opportunity over the kind of near to intermediate term? Scott Wagner : Hey, Lloyd, this is Scott. I think I'll talk about three things around the question. The first is what I\u2019d call the ongoing evolution of the open web to the different social platforms. And so if you think about an entrepreneur with an idea, it could be a business, it could be an organization, it could be an event but getting that idea to an audience both existing and new customers requires certainly a position in the open web, which is how you get found by Google but now also a position into the different social media platforms. That at an end customer level is actually complexity and that's through both GoCentral and Main Street Hub and at an integrated platform not only to get a site but to intersect that content with social media is a huge priority of ours.  The second is actually adding more applications which used to be standalone, either products or activities like bookings, invoicing, email marketing, hanging off that publishing platform right? And what you're talking about is more value delivered through not just a website but really a whole engagement platform. That really is about marketing not just publishing but taking publishing and turning it into marketing. The other idea and big pinpoint again at our customer level is what we\u2019ve talked about before, which is both voice and messaging and actually creating ways that our customers can interact with their audience in effective ways.  We have our call it toe in the water via SmartLine, and there's all sorts of ways that you can add voice and group text messaging and enable that capabilities to our end customers. And so those are the two real platforms if we think about jobs we\u2019re doing for our customers and obviously one of the unique ways that GoDaddy can provide that for people is not just with technology products but also with some hands-on help with people. And so our focus is again around our product experience, but one of the unique things that we can do in the world is provide a little bit of hands-on touch and care to get somebody ramped up or frankly in the case of people don't have time to do something themselves provide a service. And so that's -- it's not necessarily a new product per se but it's definitely a different engagement system. So those would be the three that I\u2019d highlight. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We have no further questions at this time. Scott Wagner : Great. Thanks, everybody. Thanks for your questions. Thanks for listening and we will talk to everybody in a quarter. Take care.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Sam Kemp, Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategy, you may begin your conference. Sam Kemp : Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for GoDaddy's fourth quarter and full-year 2018 earnings call. With me today are Scott Wagner, Chief Executive Officer and Ray Winborne, Chief Financial Officer. Scott and Ray will share some prepared remarks and then we will open up the call for your questions. On today's call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and operating metrics such as total bookings, unlevered free cash flow, net debt and ARPU. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents may be found in the presentation posted to our Investor Relations website at investors.godaddy.net or on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC with today's earnings release. Unless otherwise stated, when we refer to organic measures, we are referring to those measures excluding the impact of HEG and Main Street Hub. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, which include those related to our future financial results, new product introductions and innovations or our ability to integrate recent acquisitions and achieve desired synergies, including our recent acquisition of Main Street Hub. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC. Actual results may differ materially from statements that we make on this call and based on assumptions as of today February 20, 2019 and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. With that, here's Scott. Scott Wagner : Thanks Sam and thanks to everyone for joining us today to discuss our fourth quarter and full-year 2018 results. We finished 2018 on a strong note and not just on our financials, but also in the experiences and products, enabling our customers to make the world they want. GoDaddy is the best place to power an online presence and that shows up in our results. In 2018, we grew revenue 19%, drove 25% growth in our unlevered free cash flow and added over one million customers, all affirming the importance of GoDaddy to everyday entrepreneurs all around the globe. Today, we will spend time on three topics. First, the customer and product experience improvements we made in 2018 and where we are headed in 2019. Second, an update on our go-to-market engine and how we are taking the next steps in our brand to draw closer to the global community of everyday entrepreneurs. And finally Ray will cover our fourth quarter performance and outlook for 2019. In 2018, we put our shoulder into both our product and customer experience, which is a large unlock in our business as we expand the role GoDaddy plays in our customers lives. Each quarter you have heard us highlight GoCentral's expanding feature set and consistently improving metrics. If you zoom out, in 2017, we launched this product as a easy-to-use website building tool. In 2018, we took that strong foundation and integrated it across a dozen relevant third-party platforms and added a number of product functions that are seeing dramatic growth and usage. We have entered 2019 with a platform that enables everyday entrepreneurs to create robust websites and syndicate marketing across the social reputation and e-commerce landscape. If you haven't used GoCentral recently, I would really encourage you to give it a spin so you can see all that it does and how much more we are doing to help our customers succeed online. Combined with our award-winning care, GoCentral is something that is a powerful resource and uniquely GoDaddy. And while GoCentral is our flagship DIY website building product, we have also made substantial improvements in our WordPress offerings, especially within our Managed WordPress application. WordPress is important to many of our customers who want greater flexibility and customization. A third of the Internet is already built using the WordPress framework and we are continuing to take share of that growing environment making GoDaddy the largest host to paid WordPress instances in the world by the end of 2018. Our Managed WordPress offering automates the entire process of starting and maintaining a secure WordPress website, which saves our customers literally hours of work, frustration and distraction. These two applications live alongside each other in our suite of presence offerings and address complementary need states. Taken together, they are growing subscriptions more than 40% year-over-year, a clear affirmation that what we are doing there is working. GoCentral and Managed WordPress have seen robust growth and have been key to the sustained growth rates you are seeing in our $1 billion hosting and presence segment. We are also doing more for our customers within the broader product suite beyond just websites and marketing. We added a new complementary email platform through our partnership with Open-Xchange to better address the needs of emerging and price-sensitive markets, making it a great complement to Microsoft O365 offerings in mature markets. For example, in Mexico, we are now able to provide an email seat for about a $1.5 a month making it a valuable product at a value price point. Much of our effort outside of launching specific products and features in 2018 was about simplifying our customer experience from how we market to how we welcome and onboard new users to how we wow them with support and care. As a result of a lot of heavy lifting behind the scenes, our net promoter score or NPS, improved dramatically over the past year, which on a business of our scale is meaningful. We will be putting more effort into simplifying and unifying our experiences in 2019. On my second major point about go-to-market, GoDaddy already commands very strong brand awareness. And in 2019, we are building on the brand to more deeply identify with the daily journey of the everyday entrepreneur and to activate the community that already exists within GoDaddy today. You will see this in our imagery, the content that we produce in the market and the way that we reach our audience. Ultimately, where we are headed is a brand promise that can support the expansion of what we do for our customers with the tools and services we offer today and the products we will deliver over the next several years. Tactically, this is starting in the U.S., it is being borne out by six iconic influencers that are emblematic of our customers and who built their online presence with GoDaddy. For example, on February 8, we proudly launched one of those iconic influencers, Ayesha Curry, in our new Homemade brand. Over the life of this campaign, we will generate the same viewership as the Super Bowl ads we have been historically known for, but in a cost-effective and far more targeted manner. Beyond our six cornerstone icons, we are also building out a network of hundreds of vertical specific influencers who are revered in their trade and advocates of our brand. The reality is that GoDaddy's customer base has always been diverse and this strategy is allowing us to reach our target audience with a message that is as relevant to someone in New Jersey as it is in Topeka, Kansas as someone in Manchester, England delivered more nimbly and in a sustained ongoing conversation. In shifting the conversations and conversational marketing, we made a ton of progress this year in how we talk to our existing customers. And we are hitting our objectives in terms of scale and campaigns with returns above our efficiency threshold. We are seeing benefits in our ability to attach new products, drive feature engagement and find instances where there is a shifted underlying need state that we can better serve. Right now, we have an abundance of opportunities in conversational marketing and we hope to put 10% of our 2019 go-to-market budget on the field in this channel. Before I hand it off to Ray, I would like to welcome a new face to our team and to highlight some changes to our organization. First, we welcome Fara Howard as our Chief Marketing Officer. Fara has an ocean of experience from her time at Amazon Fashion, Dell and Vans and she is going to be responsible for stewarding our brand and overseeing day-to-day market activities. We have also continued to evolve our management structure. First Andrew Low Ah Kee added customer care to his broader go-to-market responsibilities under the new title of Chief Operating Officer, which is uniting the end-to-end customer lifecycle from acquisition to support. We are bringing our technology and infrastructure operations under CTO, Charles Beadnall, which is a natural progression of our technology strategy and execution ability. Finally, our products are seeing good success today and as we look to the mid-to long-term, we have begun the process of identifying our next head a product experience who can oversee the transition of our products to an integrated experience for our customers. Stepping back, we have entered 2019 with wind at our back, delivering on our financial objectives and laying the right foundation for multiyear growth. With that, here is Ray to cover our financials. Ray Winborne : Thanks Scott. I will touch on our fourth quarter financial results and our outlook for 2019. We finished the year on a strong note with fourth quarter revenue and unlevered free cash flow right on plan and with full-year bookings crossing the $3 billion mark. In 2018, we grew revenue roughly 14%, ex-currency and acquisition noise and delivered 25% growth in unlevered free cash flow, even as we made significant investments in customer experience, product and go-to-market. Our investments have positioned us well for 2019 and we are continuing to invest in a number of initiatives to help deliver our multiyear outlook of double-digit topline and high teens unlevered free cash flow growth. Turning to the fourth quarter. Bookings grew to $732 million, rising 12.5% year-over-year on a constant currency basis, a modest reacceleration relative to the third quarter growth rate. Currency created 120 basis points of headwind in Q4 and at today's exchange rates, we expect currency to be a headwind in the first half of 2019 as we comp a period of U.S. dollar weakness in 2018. Revenue came in at $696 million, growing 16% year-over-year, or about 13% excluding the impacts of purchase accounting, Main Street Hub and 0.5 point of currency headwind. We are seeing solid performance across each of the product categories. The key metrics underlying our growth have remained consistently strong. ARPU rose to $148, up 7% year-over-year and customers grew 7%, bringing the total customer base to over 18.5 million. We added over one million net new customers in 2018, reflecting a mix of strength in gross new customer adds and improved customer retention. Underneath the headline stats, the strong customer growth is a result of consistent performance in the U.S. and especially strong growth in international markets as we benefit from share gains across the world and increasing website adoption in emerging markets. Within the U.S., we focused on doing more with our customers through better site and product experiences, interactions with care and conversational marketing driving double-digit U.S. ARPU growth in 2018. Unlevered free cash flow for the year was $620 million, growing 25% year-over-year and yielding overall point of margin expansion as we saw the scale of the business drive margin benefits to the P&L, partially offset by investments we made back into the core business and dilution for Main Street Hub. On the balance sheet, we finished the year with $951 million in cash and short-term investments and net debt landed at $1.5 billion, putting our net leverage near the low end of our targeted range of two to four times on a trailing 12-month basis. With that, I will turn to our outlook for 2019. At a high level, we expect continued mid single digit growth in customers and ARPU to produce full-year revenue of $2.97 billion to $3.0 billion, representing growth of 12% to 13% versus 2018. For the first quarter, we expect revenue of $705 million to $715 million, representing 11% to 13% growth versus the first quarter of 2018, as we began to lap the gains from changes in merchandising of aftermarket domain sales in early 2018. Moving to cash flow. We expect to generate $730 million to $745 million of unlevered free cash flow in 2019 or 18% to 20% growth over 2018, implying margin expansion of about 1.5 point. We will continue to optimize around topline growth and margin accretion with any potential upside being directed back into the business. While the timing of CapEx and certain working capital items created lumpier unlevered free cash flow growth in 2018, for modeling purposes you should plan for a more evenly distributed pattern of cash flow in 2019. And finally, we expect net cash payments for interest in 2019 to be $90 million to $95 million implying slightly faster growth in levered free cash flow from 2019. Stepping back, we delivered a great 2018 and have set a strong foundation for continued growth. Our 2019 outlook reflects the consistency in our business model and growth from areas we are putting our shoulder behind to improve the customer experience, ramp product innovation and optimize the go-to-market engine. Thanks everyone for joining us today. And with that operator, let's open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Lloyd Walmsley : Thanks for taking the question. Two, if I can. I guess just first, can you give us just a sense of the scale and the potential of the new email business? It sounds like a nice complement to Office 365. And related to that, how we should think about business apps growth in 2019 and over the next few years, as you add more nascent things like the Open-Xchange partnership, things like SmartLine? And then I guess secondly, you talk about moving ad budget, explicitly to conversational marketing and you also mentioned leveraging kind of vertical specific influencers. So it sounds like you are taking the conversational marketing, which has traditionally been on-site to more of an affiliate marketing angle. Can you just help us connect it to and put that in some context, particularly as you bring in a new CMO? Thanks. Scott Wagner : Lloyd, it's Scott. I am going to take your second question first and then talk about the Open-Xchange and then Ray might add a few things on biz apps trajectory. So from a marketing standpoint, the influencers are the top of a pyramid that we are laddering down to more specific verticals that are representative of our 18.5 million customers. Ayesha Curry is mompreneur and is building out business ideas and we are excited to be working with her to power Homemade. And Ayesha obviously is a well-known icon but the same things that we have enabled Ayesha to do could be if Ayesha was somebody starting in their basement in Topeka, Kansas. And there is five other influencers across different areas like fashion, music, et cetera that we are going to amplify. That's really our brand investment, right. It's a way to communicate our brand for everyday entrepreneurs. Now when you shift to conversational marketing, that's talking to our base with very specific ideas, whether it's adding social and media and reputation management to an existing site and service or wrapping security around their entire site and email environment. It's a very specific thing that we identify, add an individual customer and then we can either reach out via care and/or differ marketing channels to go address that audience. And so those are really, you are covering the full scope of our marketing and media opportunity. And obviously, Fara, who is coming in as our CMO, she is a terrific storyteller from a brand standpoint, but also analytic and purposeful, which is part of how you get to your base in a specific way. So that's the strategy on the marketing front. For OX, think about that as an adjacent complement to an already strong email and productivity business and the fundamental value proposition for many of our customers is having a branded email and productivity suite. And what OX is enabling us to do is to hit much lower price points around the world. And so if you are in Mexico and Brazil, which is where this launched or if you are moving over to the emerging markets in Asia, we are able to get somebody a full-some branded email at what amounts to a little over $1 a month which is complement and value price point. So we think that's a nice addition and is just another way that we can continue to grow our email and productivity franchise. I think Ray is going to talk about just applications in general and how to think about the growth rates going forward. Ray Winborne : Yes. Lloyd, it's Ray. I think when you think about that biz apps line, that's always our fastest growing product category. That's on trajectory to become $0.5 billion business for us. So we are truly excited to continue to add piece parts into that solution set. We continue to see the line of sight to deliver that biz apps growth within our three to four times customer growth framework that we have been giving you guys for a while. Lloyd Walmsley : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Your line is open. Jason Helfstein : Thanks. So first, it seems that there is an overall theme in the industry, where both you and your competitors are all effectively trying to move, I don't want to say up-market, but really focusing on the higher LTV customers at better price points where there is the ability to upsell over time. Maybe talk about kind of how that's been involving because it does seem to be a theme? We heard this morning at another company and it feels like a theme. Secondly, I noticed if I saw correctly, you didn't buyback any stock in the quarter following the buyback authorization. So any update on capital thoughts? We would imagine you are thinking about potential M&A? And any update there? And if we could potentially see a transaction in 2019? Thanks. Scott Wagner : Hi Jason. First on your first comment. Our strategy has been constant, certainly as a public company and really, if I back it up over the last five to seven years. I mean we are really early in a ideas formation and obviously, we continue to add customers at a fast growth rate and in terms of a quantum of customer adds, we are effectively at an all-time high of being over a million plus net new customers. And so that continues to be the anchor of what we are doing. And then ARPU for us is really about just fulfilling a broader set of a customer's needs, which has always been the great opportunity for us over time. So relative to other people in the industry, I wouldn't even think about it or comment very much. I think this is just us fulfilling our strategy and the fundamentals of our business model. I will hand it off to Ray to talk about your second question. Ray Winborne : Hi Jason, it's Ray. No change in our capital allocation priority. It's obviously still organic growth, M&A and share repurchases, in that order. There is obviously a variety of reasons we would be in the market or not in the market for our own shares. And we are not going to comment specifically on those reasons. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt Pfau with William Blair. Your line is open. Matt Pfau : Hi guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to touch on the commentary around ARPU growth and specifically how ARPU growth was faster in the U.S. than the rest of the world. So I guess, as you think about the opportunity longer term, is there something that would keep international ARPU from being the same as that of the U.S.? And then related to the growth you are seeing in the quarter or this year, what's driving that? Is it just product set or something else that's driving the difference in ARPU growth between the two different regions? Scott Wagner : Hi Matt. That's a good question. I think on the U.S., what you are seeing is, the U.S. is obviously our most developed market. And if you think about two things, one of which is the full-some nature of our product portfolio, so when you get into more advanced digital marketing things and solutions, whether it's either GoCentral itself and then things like SEO optimization or social media management, right now we are really focusing on the United States and Canada, to a lesser extent, but North America to bring those to market. And so, those have higher value, therefore higher ARPU. And when I talk about conversational marketing, which is really going into the base, our efforts are also focused on North America there to really get momentum and prove it out. And so what you are seeing on those things is an impact that is showing up in the U.S. that over time we are going to move that into international markets around the world. Now your question around, is there any reason why we can't think about international at that same level. I think there is always going to be a difference between the U.S. ARPU and international specifically because of both product mix and willing to spend around the world. I think the relevant point is, international growth is still solid. We are proving out certain things in the U.S. that will apply to markets around the world and the economics around acquisition and development internationally are still really, really good. And so anyway, the international, we continue to feel good about the growth overall and down the road, there will be learnings from the U.S. that will eventually move into international markets. Matt Pfau : Great. That's it for me guys. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question is from Mark Mahaney with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Zachary Schwartzman : Hi. It's Zachary Schwartzman, on for Mark. I had a follow-up to Lloyd's earlier question. For 2019, is there any reason to expect different contribution to revenue between your three segments, domains, hosting and presence and business divisions? Whether that's through new products or continued shift towards conversational marketing? Do you expect the breakdown to shift in 2019? Thanks. Ray Winborne : Hi Zach, it's Ray. So if you look at the framework that we have put out there, nothing has really changed from that perspective. One times customer growth on domains, we have done a little better than that and we expect that to be a little better in 2019 but over the long-term we are pointing back to customer growth. Hosting and presence, one to two times customer growth. We are landing at the high end of that now and we expect that to be the case in 2019 as well. And as I mentioned earlier with Lloyd's question around biz apps, still see line of sight there to three to four times customer growth. Zachary Schwartzman : Great. Thanks. And one more quick one. On international, are there any regions that you feel represents a greater opportunity in 2019, that GoDaddy is already in that you could expect could contribute more to international growth? Thanks. Scott Wagner : Yes. Zach, we are in 50-plus markets today. So it's not the geographic footprint as much as it is going deeper in those. And it is a broad-based opportunity. As you look at the growth that we are seeing in international business, it's widespread. So whether that's Latin America, Asia or even in the Middle East, we are a good shift there. Operator : Your next question is from Deepak Mathivanan with Barclays. Your line is open. Deepak Mathivanan : Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. Two questions for me. So first, last quarter you pursued sort of effort slightly more aggressively, I believe, to reduce multiyear discounts on certain products to help improve engagement with customers. And that kind of weighed on bookings growth slightly. Did that continue into 4Q? And operationally, are you now at a steady state with respect to contract length for various products that you want to offer to customers? And then second question somewhat related to the question before, I know it's a small part of your business, but can you comment on the trends coming out of China? What are you factoring into your 2019 guide? Thank you. Ray Winborne : Hi Deepak, it's Ray. When we brought up term last quarter, it was for visibility. That is something that's been a factor in our business for a long time. And if look over a multiyear basis, term has continued to shrink and a lot of that's been driven by the product mix. As we move away from domains and the two other product groups are growing faster, those are shorter-term products. So nothing has changed dramatically, third quarter to fourth quarter. We will continue to see that over time. We are seeing good results from some of the tests that we have done there, from an LTV perspective. So we will continue to work that direction with bookings. With respect to China, I mentioned it last quarter, a small piece of our business. It's been really growing well for us. We saw some softness in the back half of 2018 relative to a very strong first half, but the annual growth rate is still very strong. Operator : Your next question comes from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open. Mike Olson : Hi. Good afternoon. I just had a couple. I just wanted to make sure that we go the message right on CapEx. So last quarter you talked about it being a bit light in Q3 and then bouncing back in Q4, which it did. It sounds like you are saying CapEx should be a more regular run rate in 2019. So just confirming, is that what you are pointing to? And then you mentioned FX will be a headwind in Q1 and first half of the year. Just so we have a sense for it, can you share any quantified ballpark impact that you are expecting in Q1? Thanks. Ray Winborne : Yes. Mike, so as you pointed out the CapEx, you did understand that right. It was just a shift from third quarter to fourth quarter. If you look at this business, it's very capital efficient. We are going to run 3% to 4% of revenue and we continue to see that net over a longer period of time will trend as we move to the cloud. But year-end 2019, 3% to 4% of cap revenue is a good spot. So on currency impact, yes, so you obviously saw the impact in the fourth quarter. If you look back at the rates in the first quarter, our first half of the year last year, the dollar was pretty week and we are looking at a range of a couple hundred basis points of headwind against bookings in the first half. Mike Olson : Got it. Thanks. Perfect. Operator : Your next question is from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Sterling Auty : Yes. Thanks. One question for you, Ray and then a follow-up for Scott. So Ray, just philosophically, I want to understand if duration continues to shorten out, that has some pressure on deferred revenue. You are guiding revenue growth 11% to 13%. What's the last part that builds in that allows you to continue to grow unlevered free cash flow 18% to 20%. Ray Winborne : Hi Sterling, it's Ray. So as I look at the growth rate, that term is not going to go down forever, right. It's a fairly steady reduction that we have seen over a multiyear basis. it can bounce a little bit if we have specific merchandising, but I think you are going to continue to see pretty stable growth rate between revenue and bookings. We have converged now a lot of the acquisition noises coming out of that number. So I think that if you look at the pacing of our bookings on a constant currency basis in the third and fourth quarter of 2018, that's a good barometer as you look into 2019. Scott Wagner : And Sterling, it's Scott. Maybe just to add on. We do just get some flow-through to margin through the P&L, whether it's the value adds, gross margin accretion or some amount of scale through G&A in our tech and dev lines that over time we have been managing that trade-off of reinvestment into the business and scale and flow-through. So as you look at our guide through the year, that incorporates those actions playing out. Sterling Auty : Okay. And then a follow-up. You had touched upon it a little bit earlier. I am just going to be a little bit more blunt about it. Wix really announced a very significant change in their strategy and getting rid of Domain Connect, some of the low-end and saying that they are going to come after more of the professional developer, the WordPress and Drupal crowd. Do you think that GoCentral is having a competitive impact? Do you think you are taking share? And when you look at that developer community, both things that you did from Media Temple and all the way through, how do you feel like your retention and growth opportunity in that base is as it looks like the competition between the two companies is going to heat up. Scott Wagner : Hi Sterling. I think we are just well positioned to serve the need state of getting, activating somebody's presence, whether it's a little basic, right, a basic DIY or more advanced services. And you know, gosh, it's still a really fragmented market. I think we are just happy with the growth rates we are seeing in our business. And I wouldn't necessarily call out one company versus another. We are focused on continuing to fulfill the need state of, boy, activate online presence across customers who either already have or coming to us for an aim and the better and better we do that, the better for us it is and we think it's great for our customers too. Sterling Auty : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Your line is open. Ron Josey : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just two, one on Main Street Hub, one on merchandising. So just on Main Street Hub, you know, post the acquisition being closed, I think, in call it mid, early 3Q, can you talk about the progress you have made over the two million potential customers you have highlighted that you can go after with the upsell? That's the first question. The second question is just on merchandising. I know there has been a lot of investment and talk last year about just making the site a lot more easier to use in terms of highlighting all the different products you sell and offer. GoCentral's capability is a great example of how that's turned into a platform. But just can you talk about where you are maybe on the way to improving the overall merchandising of the platform and maybe how that ties into conversational marketing? Thank you. Scott Wagner : Thanks Ron. First, on Main Street Hub. We are making progress. Right now, the Main Street Hub social media and reputation management service is integrated into GoDaddy and is being represented as GoDaddy Social and we have teams reaching out into GoDaddy's base. And the thesis of delivering that service as part of GoDaddy versus a standalone third-party is completely proving out. Now in terms of execution and where we are in the journey, it's still early days to making that super-tight. So we are seeing all the proof points of progress around it, but I would still say we are in the very early innings of executing that at scale relative to, let's say, the two million customers that you just described. But the proof points are playing out, which is nice. On front of site, we have been focused quite a bit around basic mechanics in the site to connect both our products together and to make the site more visual. And in 2019, you are just going to start to see more of those changes. Here is a simple example. Today, that you are seeing where if you are going to GoDaddy and you are seeing Ayesha Curry's Homemade site, you are actually seeing templates, Ayesha inspired themes and designs that you can connect into immediately off the site and flow right into those kinds of themes. And it's much more seamless and fluid than what we have been able to do in the past. Boy, 2019 is going to be about doing more of that kind of work. Ron Josey : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Nick Jones with Citi. Your line is open. Nick Jones : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. On the top-level domains, are there any trends you can point to far as a domain buyers bundling multiple TLDs? And then my second question is on Managed WordPress. Are you seeing any professionals or experts start to use that in their business? Scott Wagner : Hi, it's Scott. On the first question, honestly there is no trends that are big enough to mention on this call. To your second point on just pros in managed WordPress, WordPress is the open source CMS platform for the open web. The biggest issues with WordPress, if you are working and using on it, are plug-in maintenance and overall security and just the level of time and attention that it takes to actually run that. Look, our managed platform, managed WordPress platform, totally automates and simplifies that process and we are making it easier and easier and easier. And so the feature improvement is both security layer, but more importantly, on app plug-in and theme updates to just make it super easy for performance and reliability. So I think you are seeing it not just for pros, but also for pros handing sites like that off to individuals or small businesses that are managing it for themselves. Nick Jones : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Naved Khan with SunTrust. Your line is open. Naved Khan : Thanks a lot. Just a follow-up question on Main Street Hub. So I guess, the plan was to introduce lower priced packages as well sometime in 2019. Can you give us a sense of timing in terms of where you are with respect to the relaunch? Scott Wagner : Hi Naved. You are going to see really the services rolling out across GoDaddy, which is what we are focused on now. In terms of the specifics of lower price points delivered through there, we are going to keep working on it and experimenting about delivery on it. So I am going to give you a specific timeframe, but that's the kind of stuff that the teams are working on. Priority number one is great value proposition for what exists represented under GoDaddy. Naved Khan : Got it. And then maybe as a quick follow-up, can you just comment on the broader macro picture? Are you seeing any changes in terms of either maybe customer retention or just gross adds? Scott Wagner : Not particularly at a macro level. I will say retention, remember, operates at two levels for us. The first is customers and then the second our individual products. And for us the continued theme of retention at both levels are slightly improving. And by slightly, I mean individual products and overall customers both on a mix adjusted basis are just continuing to improve on really tens of basis points, which has been over the last several years. But that's all goodness because those are the kind of things that happen when you have products, deliver them in a great way, with great support and service, you just get those kinds of things as an outcome. So to be very clear, no big change in the trajectory that we are on. But there is goodness happening there. And then second on adds, again, we do not manage to the add number, but it's nice that our net add number is up and again we are focused on good customers that we think are to build things up over time. And what you are seeing in that number is continued opportunity and fulfillment for us around the world. So no big change, I think, on the acquisition front and the trajectory we have been on for the last several years. Ray Winborne : That's right. The only thing I would add to that from an international basis at a macro, we are just obviously seeing currency pressures. But the customer growth and market share increases are still occurring. Naved Khan : Got it. Thank you Scott. Thank you Ray. Operator : Your next question is from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Your line is open. Brent Thill : Hi Scott. If you could maybe just walk through how you prioritize the international playbook for 2019? Where you seeing the biggest opportunities? Where are you putting most energy in? And then I had a quick follow-up for Ray. Just as it relates to deferred revenue, it was down, I think, sequentially. First time we have seen in the model. It would seem that's due to the shorter contract duration. Is there anything else that's accounting for that change in DR? Thank you. Scott Wagner : Thanks Brent. In terms of prioritization, there is no one geo that we are saying, boy, we are leaning into it at a different level or rate. In EMEA, that's obviously our biggest market and so the focus in EMEA is taking some of the capabilities and product portfolio of the U.S. whether it be conversational marketing or features like security, backup malware scans, plug-ins and actually moving it over to Europe. So I think priority in Europe is take what we see as working in the U.S. and moving it there. Mexico and Brazil continue to have great growth potential. So that's the focus in Latin America. And then in Asia, it continues to be about customer adds. Ray Winborne : Hi Brent, it's Ray. To answer your second question, we have been pretty pleased. We saw bookings reaccelerate in the fourth quarter relative to third. But the same factors are affecting your deferred revenue. It's term year-over-year and that's being driven by the product mix for the most part and currency is the other impact over there. Brent Thill : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Mark Grant with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Mark Grant : Great. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to follow-up quickly on Lloyd's question earlier on the conversational marketing initiatives. You have been working on these now for about a year. You have been talking about them publicly. And with Fara coming in and Andrew taking on incremental responsibility for customer care broadly, can you talk a little bit about what you have learned over the last year that informs your decision to allocate kind of 10% of the budget to those initiatives? What you are seeing from the customer care reps in their outreach? And any change to your view on how effective those initiatives could be around driving or potentially even accelerating ARPU growth in 2019 would be helpful? Scott Wagner : Thanks Mark. So the purpose again behind this is, boy, if we identify and we can with i.e., specific need or opportunity for our customers and to reach out with that purpose, whether it be security, whether it could be an SEO optimization, but just one thing to reach out and say, hey, check this out or have you thought about this. And from a metric standpoint, we are targeting a three times lifetime value to cost of acquisition, which incorporates not only spend, but the cost of a rep before reaching out through their care center, which is all incremental. Some of the returns that we are seeing are multiples beyond that. I mean you are seeing double digit returns on specific ideas. So we are seeing, again I mentioned 3X is the absolute minimum and floor for us to continue, but we are seeing things that are modestly even better than our average acquisition metric. So we are seeing enough proof points to say, this should take some amount of dollars for us as a system to continue to scale it out. I think what you are seeing on care connected to marketing, Fara, Andrew, is just our evolution to try to execute that at scale, not only in the U.S. but around the world. I mean, I really wish our biggest gate here is just our ability to execute with a great integrated design flow for every single conversation. We have hundreds of, frankly, ideas or things that we absolutely know that we can, should and want to reach out to individual components of our customers. It's about getting scale through our platforms and connecting our website to e-mail to care in an integrated way with great design and great messaging. So what you are seeing organizationally is just our desire to go execute that. Mark Grant : Great. Thank you. That's helpful. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your next question is from Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Brian Essex : Hi. Good afternoon and thank you for taking the question. Scott, I just wanted to touch on your international expansion, particularly as it relates to potential pricing power. Is it different in different geographies? Are there other kind of parts of your suite that are more robust in certain areas? And then might you be able to leverage any pricing power in geos to offset any either development costs for penetration of those deals or associated FX headwind that you might have there? Scott Wagner : Hi Brian. Certainly different geos have different both willingness to pay in absolute and applicability within our product markets. I mean I think the North American and European markets' customers' need states are effectively the same. And so you see the same application of product suite plus relative price points in those geographies. Modestly, Latin America kind of looks like that too. When you move over to the Asia markets, as we have said for a long time, whether you are in India or Asia, the applicability and willingness to pay is different. And so when you see something like OX, for example, that delivered just low cost e-mail, we are using that as a way to make a branded e-mail and communication for those markets more accessible. So starting that in Latin America and we are going to roll that into the Asian markets as well. And overtime, I do think the Asia markets today they have a different spend profile than the U.S. But again, when we think about marketing dollars and how we spend against those markets, it's reflective of sort of a lower spend right now. Ray Winborne : Hi Brian, it's Ray. And to follow-up on your other question, as far as current pricing for currency, absolutely. We adjust prices based off of currency movements to the extent the market will bear it. Brian Essex : Got it. That's helpful. And maybe if I can follow up on your partnership with Amazon. Any current update there? And how is that impacting as you migrate to more of a cloud-based infrastructure the margins? And is there any kind of incremental, I guess, momentum with the partnership in terms of ability to develop on that platform or ability to sell through that partner? Ray Winborne : Yes. Brian, let me start with the infrastructure piece and I will let Scott follow-up on the product side. From an infrastructure perspective, things are going very well. We have already started to move some of our workloads over, particularly on the product development side. And as I have mentioned in prior calls, that's a smaller piece of the overall workload. So this is a multiyear effort. You are not going to see any dramatic impacts from a P&L or capital perspective in 2019. It's all reflected in the guide that we provided earlier. Scott Wagner : From a product front, we are working across a couple of different areas of applications and capabilities that we have to roll in to Amazon. That's going to work throughout 2019. There's nothing that I would call out specifically on this call that would be a big mover for the business. But again, we are developing. We have five to six different things on the roadmap that we are working through throughout 2019. Brian Essex : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. This does conclude the Q&A portion of today's call. I will now turn it back over to the presenters for any closing remarks. Scott Wagner : Thanks everybody. I really appreciate the questions. Thanks for listening in and we will talk to everybody next quarter. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Sam Kemp, VP of Investor Relations and Strategy. You may begin your conference. Sam Kemp : Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for GoDaddy's first quarter 2019 earnings call. With me today are Scott Wagner, Chief Executive Officer and Ray Winborne, Chief Financial Officer. Scott and Ray will share some prepared remarks and then we'll open up the call for questions. On today's call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and operating metrics such as total bookings, unlevered free cash flow, net debt and ARPU. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents may be found in the presentation posted to our Investor Relations website at investors.godaddy.net or on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC with today's earnings release. Unless otherwise stated, when we refer to organic measures, we are referring to those measures excluding the impact of Main Street Hub. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, which include those related to our future financial results, product introductions and innovations, our share repurchase program and our ability to integrate recent or potential future acquisitions and achieve desired synergies, Any forward-looking statements that we make on this all are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC are based on assumptions as of today May 2, 2019 and may differ materially from actual results. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. With that, here's Scott. Scott Wagner : Thanks, Sam. And thanks to everyone for joining us today to discuss our first quarter of 2019, which is started off at a solid pace. GoDaddy revenue is up over 12% and our cash flow margins continue to expand even with the investments we're making across the business. Companies that thrive over the long term consistently focus on finding new ways to add customer value. And here at GoDaddy we're doing this through constant improvements in our entire experience across product, marketing and care, as we build not just for 2019 and 2020, but for the years to come. Today we'll spend time on three topics. First, I'll share our quarterly product progress both organically and through our recent acquisitions. Second, an update on how we're driving growth in domestic and international markets. And finally, Ray we'll cover our first quarter financial performance and outlook for the remainder of 2019. I'll start with our products. GoDaddy empowers the everyday entrepreneur by designing applications and services that help our customers look good, be everywhere and engage with their audiences. Our feature release pace continues to be rapid and in just the first several months of the year we've taken big steps forward in e-commerce, digital marketing and the WordPress ecosystem. Let me touch on each briefly. First, on e-commerce. Our functionality continues to build on what's now a multi-year effort behind both service and product commerce tools. In March we launched support for digital downloads in online stores, enabling customers to sell music, e-books, videos, art and other digital content. In April we acquired Sellbrite, a world class, multi-channel commerce suite that has tens of millions of orders and billions of dollars of cumulative GMV in channels like Amazon, Etsy, eBay and Walmart.com. We partnered with Sellbrite last year to power our first go central marketplace offer and saw strong early customer traction, by joining forces will more deeply integrate Sellbrite's e-commerce channel capabilities, inventory management and fulfillment tools Indigo Central and eventually into our WordPress offerings. Second, we continue to expand the suite of marketing tools available in GoCentral. At an enterprise or mid-market level you'll hear the term CRM and marketing automation a lot. But for our customers these functions and their digital presence are really all blurred together. And as we help our customers be everywhere, we at GoDaddy at our best when we unite these tools into a simple and thoughtful experience. Today we're tailoring marketing recommendations, using data science, in the GoCentral Dashboard and in March we launched a customer management tool called Connections, which helps entrepreneurs organize and stay close to their customers. We have deep insights into the ventures using GoDaddy and their audiences and this tool is a foundation that we'll use to help simplify, personalize and automate marketing for our customers. This is an important step as we expand what we do, enabling not only the creation of an online presence, but ensuring that it thrives. And finally, we continue to invest behind WordPress as ecosystem of third party themes which make websites beautiful and plugins which give them optionality. At the end of Q1 there were more than three million installs of GoDaddy own plugins and themes in WordPress websites around the world. In April we added to this ecosystem by acquiring CoBlocks which streamlines the WordPress website creation process and ThemeBeans which is a library of elegant and modern website themes. As we expand the resources supporting our WordPress offer, we're bringing an increasingly differentiated experience to the world's largest open source CMS through simplicity, security and elegant design. Stepping back on our products overall, the investments we're making across both GoCentral and WordPress are increasingly being recognized in the market as we pursue strategies that lead to the success of our customers. Let me now turn to our go to market efforts, where we're supporting the product momentum I just discussed by driving consideration and usage for both prospective and existing GoDaddy customers. Our underlying bookings growth accelerated for the second quarter, reflecting strong tailwinds from our brand initiatives and tactical marketing performance. Over the last several years we've grown our incremental marketing spend largely by investing outside the US which has helped drive our global scale. In 2019 we're directing the bulk of our new marketing efforts in discretionary spend in the US and we're happy with the results, including the great early performance of the brand strategy that we launched in February. Our lineup of influencers has resonated well, we're reaching a more diverse audience and our marketing execution continues to acquire customers at attractive economics. Importantly, the metrics we monitor for brand health and how well everyday entrepreneurs identify with GoDaddy are all moving in the right direction. Conversational marketing also continues to ramp nicely with a broader base of campaigns being run against a broader range of customer needs. Since the beginning of 2018, we've taken conversational marketing from a concept, a scaling channel for reaching our base in a helpful, impactful way, all while exceeding our target thresholds for returns. Our international business has been a big success over the last several years and at $1 billion run rate is now larger than all of GoDaddy in 2012 which is the year that we first began localizing international markets. As we look forward, we remain bullish on our international potential and have three core priorities to continue driving growth. First, international market growth starts with localizing our existing products, marketing and care in a targeted geography. We've done this across well over 50 markets and we continue to ramp into new and under penetrated countries, like Germany, South Africa and the Philippines. As we do this we benefit from both the tailwinds of continuing Internet adoption and developing markets and share gains from small and relatively fragmented local players which builds a nice runway in countries across Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Middle East. The second priority is launching products and experience tailored to a markets unique needs which we've just started to do in a handful of regions. For example in Asia we're expanding support for care conversations in WeChat and other relevant messaging platforms. In India, which is a do it for you market, we have a vibrant pro community built around our web pro offering in the GoDaddy brand and in certain price sensitive markets like Brazil, Mexico and recently India, we've launched value priced email through open exchange which has doubled the run rate of email unit sales in these countries. And finally in our largest and most mature markets we look to drive deeper customer engagement which ultimately shows up in ARPU. As you know the US is our oldest market and we continue to grow at a double-digit pace, showing that strategies like conversational marketing can sustain healthy growth over the long term. A ramp of conversational marketing, along with a broader and richer product portfolio and experience has been focused in the US where we're driving significant innovation and as we refine this new playbook we expect to be able to export it to other maturing international markets as a core strategy to drive ongoing growth. The punch line is that we continue to see many vectors of growth in domestic and international markets, supported by a diverse set of product and operational initiatives in each market and for you our shareholders this creates a clear line of sight to continued double-digit top line growth. Before I wrap, I want to emphasize our focus on building a business that's aimed at customer success and that could deliver for years to come. We're proud of the consistency of our execution and more importantly how we've evolved as a company. We've got a good business, a great customer and market to serve and a fantastic team all of which underpinned what we deliver to our shareholders. With that here's Ray to cover the financials. Ray Winborne : Thanks, Scott. We started 2019 on a strong foot with an acceleration in underlying bookings trends, continued strength in customer and ARPU growth and ongoing margin expansion that balance is growing cash flow with the right rate of reinvestment for the long term. Q1 bookings grew to $871 million, rising 13.5% on a constant currency basis or about 100 basis points faster than fourth quarter growth. Reported bookings growth of 11% reflects about 230 basis points of currency headwinds and at today's exchange rates we expect this to continue into Q2 and be a wash in the second half. Revenue came in at $710 million, growing 13.5% on a constant currency basis and 12% on a reported basis, reflecting 150 basis points of exchange rate headwinds. Like for like revenue growth decelerated a couple of hundred basis points from Q4 which reflects tough comps from a year ago, most notably in our aftermarket business. Our key metrics remain strong, reflecting goodness in both ARPU and customer growth. ARPU rose to $150, up 9 % year over year and normalizing for acquisitions and currency remained steady in the mid-single digit range. Our customer base grew more than 6% to $18.8 million, adding over 1 million net new customers in the past year. As we see continued strength in new ads and modest reductions in churn, Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter grew 22% year over year to $199 million. Our trailing 12 month unlevered free cash flow margin expanded to 24%, up over 100 basis points versus a year ago. On the balance sheet, we finished Q1 with $1.1 billion in cash and short term investments. Net debt landed at $1.3 billion or about 1.9 times net leverage. As Scott touched on earlier, we made a couple of smaller acquisitions after the quarter ended, which are immaterial in both cash outlay and their contribution to the P&L With that, I'll turn to our outlook for the rest of 2019. We continue to expect mid single digit growth in customers and ARPU will produce full year revenue of $2.97 billion to $3 billion, implying full year growth of 12% to 13 %. For the second quarter, we expect revenue of $730 million to $740 million, representing 12% to 14 % growth versus the second quarter of 2018. For full year unlevered free cash flow, we expect to generate $730 million to $745 million, representing a 0.5 of margin expansion versus 2018. With our recent credit rating upgrade, we now expect net cash payments for interest in 2019 to be $80 million to $85 million, yielding slightly faster growth and unlevered free cash flow in 2019. Stepping back, we continue to deliver consistent results, while executing against our key priorities in customer experience, product and marketing, laying the foundation for sustainable growth in the future. Thanks everyone for joining us today. And with that operator, let's open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Brent Thill : Good afternoon. When you talk about the bookings growth acceleration to 13.5 and 12.5 in Q4, can you just talk through maybe what you saw in Q1 that led you to that? And then secondarily, some of us or customers of yours and we noticed some small price changes in our bill where we haven't seen that in the last couple of years. Is there a broader price increase going through the system or is this just selective in some areas be helpful, many others have obviously raised prices across tech in the last year and I think there's a lot of questions from investors around your approach in pricing? Thank you. Ray Winborne : Hey, Brent. It's Ray. I'll take the first of those and I'll pass it to Scott on pricing. As far as the acceleration in bookings quarter-to-quarter, it was broad based across a number of areas where we're driving change in product, as well as go to market and merchandising. And you can see that show up in both the customer growth, as well as the ARPU growth. Scott Wagner : Yeah. Hey, Brent. And on your price question. Overall, our strategy is having an incredibly valuable product at a valuable price and over time you know we're constantly looking at how we wrap our products together with the lowest prices you know. And tweaking - tweaking that. So that again there's overall value. You know again our combination of ARPU is around adoption of products. It's around value-add and then select pricing. And I think you're wrapper comment was is what you saw selective and the answer is yes selective. It fits with the philosophy and strategy we've had for a long time around value product at a value price. Brent Thill : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer. Jason Helfstein : Thanks. Two questions. One, can you talk about the currency impact on business applications. I think you did mention that it was tougher comps and I'm just wondering you know, kind of currency impact there? Question two, when we think about e-commerce, how do you expect to monetize that. Is that a function of getting customers to adopt higher ARPU, was there - or another way that you'll kind of monetize that? And then just lastly housekeeping, from here do you think kind of expenses should be more linear or just because of the moving parts. I think the street and ourselves has kind of struggled with modelling expenses and kind of from here do you think it gets more smoother? Thanks, Ray Winborne : Hey, Jason. It's Ray I'll take the first one and the last one, I'll pass the one on e-commerce to Scott. When you're looking at biz apps, I wouldn't point as much to currency within there, there's about 150 basis points of currency headwind in the revenue this quarter and a disproportionate amount of that headwind is actually in the Hosting and Presence line. With biz apps it landed you know, exactly where we expect in the quarter. If you'll recall from the last fourth quarter call, I talked about us lapping a number of initiatives and merchandising changes from last year, just creating a little tougher comp this year. It is still by far our fastest growing product category. We're on a trajectory now for this to be a $0.5 billion business this year. And if you look at the quantum of growth on a dollar basis, it's been pretty darn steady, if you look at past about four or five quarters. We continue to see line of sight there to hit that three to four times customer growth algorithm. We've been talking to you guys about our longer term. Scott Wagner : Hey, Jason. It's Scott. And on e-commerce, right now both we as GoDaddy, plus Sellbrite both monetize through subscription and as of right now our focus is going to be around driving unit adoption. So Sellbrite combined with GoDaddy to have an incredibly valuable capability not just to have an online site in the open web, but also connect that card to everywhere it needs to be online and to have that for monthly subscription. Now we will obviously think about and look at ways to think about transaction flow over time, but as of right now our focus is going to be around driving units and driving adoption. Ray Winborne : Yeah. And on your last question around expense growth. You know, we talked to you guys through the back half of last year where we were investing back in the business, given the tailwind we had on revenue, you will see that combined with the cash burn from Main Street impacting our expenses through the second half of this year, then you should start to see those growth rates level out in the back half. Jason Helfstein : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Zachary Schwartzman from RBC Capital Markets. Zachary Schwartzman : Thanks for taking my questions. Scott, in your opening comments you spoke about your bullishness on the international opportunity, including India and how the \"do it for you\" market. You also called out the launch of your open exchange power business email there. Can you remind us how many current customers you have in India? And talk a little more about the geographic opportunity - opportunity and the ability to expand your go to market capabilities there? Thank you. Scott Wagner : Hey, Zach in India, we've said we've got over a million paying customers in the market which is great. Obviously, India is still in pretty early stages of open Internet adoption and you know our own growth there will be continuing the ride that adoption curve. And as I mentioned particularly of a couple of tailored products to the pros who build online presences for others. And so you know, we think that India has continued trajectory and you know I'd say what we're also seeing through hope and exchange and other things is really nice growth in other emerging markets like Brazil and Mexico. Zachary Schwartzman : And a quick follow up on Brent's question earlier on some of the selective or just the normal industry pricing changes from some of your peers. Are you seeing any I guess read through is from that - the amount that were from the selective price increases or do you feel that there's a further opportunity for your most engaged customers whether that's through additional product expansion or pricing levers? Thanks. Scott Wagner : I would - nothing that's I think particular to call out to everybody, again our - the strategy around value product at a value price point is great. I will say there are others in our industry that are very explicitly trying to drive significant price increases in a couple of categories. I think that puts us in a nice relative position. Our biggest focus is around quality right now of the experience around adoption and units and being able to do more with our existing customers. So you know, in terms of the premise of your question, I don't think there's anything that I or we should call out specifically and again our focus will be around doing more with our existing customers, driving value in adoption and that'll show up well over time. Zachary Schwartzman : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. This is Brown [ph] on for Sterling Auty. Thanks for taking the question. So I know you mentioned there were some FX headwinds in the Hosting and Presence segment. I was wondering if you could touch a bit on the contribution from Main Street hub and GoCentral in the quarter and what the performance was for those? Scott Wagner : I mentioned with Jason's question around the FX exposure there. From a Main Street perspective, you know, we had disclosed to you guys a $40 million run rate to $10 million a quarter for Main Street in that existing business and that's good place over for you to continue to push in there. As far as GoCentral and Managed WordPress, the two applications show up in that line. We're not disclosing that every quarter Scott talked about it last quarter with the 40% growth. We're continuing to see good growth in those applications. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt Pfau from William Blair. Matt Pfau : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just have one on Sellbrite. So my understanding is that a lot of your e-commerce companies or at least are more weighted towards services business versus product business. So is the plan with Sellbrite more to expand the product portfolio to bring new product selling businesses into the mix. Or is there a sizable base of product customers within your existing e-commerce base that you can take to Sellbrite tool to? Scott Wagner : Well, I think it's about expanding the range of capabilities within e-commerce, so you're right around you know service commerce and that's something that we've certainly ramped up over the last couple of years. And Sellbrite adds a capability again where you know somebody who's card can now absolutely get syndicated managed and show up across the big marketplaces. And that's just a great capability around product commerce. And so we think that this will allow us to deliver incremental value certainly GoCentral towards product commerce and down the road it's a great capability to add to WordPress. And so if you think about a lot of the footprint of e-commerce retail around there's a frankly a huge chunk of installed base within and around WordPress and we're excited about the capability that Sellbrite offers and how to deploy it not only to go central but also to the world WordPress community. Matt Pfau : Great. Thanks guys for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from Ron Josey from GMP. Ron Josey : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Scott, two please. Just I think you mentioned most new marketing efforts in discretionary spend would DE [ph] directed here in the US. And so could you just talk a little bit more about your marketing strategy here in the states specifically and maybe the products you plan to highlight last lead with. And then sort of as a secondary to that. You know, I'm pretty intrigued with the connections tool and bigger picture. How you view connections with marketplaces and GoCentral in terms of the marketing messaging and just basically the product together and sort of bigger picture where that can go? Thank you. Scott Wagner : Great. Yeah, thanks Ron. Well, you know in the US the strategy has been to emphasize the GoDaddy brand and really standing for empowering everyday entrepreneurs and you're seeing that whether it's in social media or different YouTube executions ways to show and link GoDaddy to the full lifecycle of things that we can do with our customers. Because right now the richness of our product portfolio it is still something that frankly we've got an opportunity here in the US to expose or almost reintroduce ourselves to both existing customers and prospects. And so that's been the strategy and focus of frankly incremental dollars through the year and then when we say both brand enhancement and conversational marketing it's about those two things. So that's the first. And frankly again we're happy I think with the results both in terms of the receptivity of the message and how it's showing up in dollars. To your second question around connections. Think about that as a foundation. And it's a foundation in digital marketing that really brings together website, digital marketing and social presence, which are a continuum now and we're really poised to bring all three of those capabilities together in an easy simple way for customers, both at a product level and then obviously when you think about Main Street Hub that's a bit of a hands on execution that for certain people who need extra help or want somebody to take on those services for them or set up to do it. So appreciate the interest and connections and I would think about that as a foundation in digital marketing that we're going to do a heck of a lot more work in the quarters to come. So stay tuned. Ron Josey : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ygal Arounian from Wedbush Securities. Ygal Arounian : Hi, guys. Good afternoon. So maybe I'll start with Scott. Clearly a lot of focus on hosting a presence, building on the products out there, accelerating the pace of the rollouts, Scott, we haven't heard as much about product rollouts in business applications just wanted to get your thoughts on kind of next steps of products that you could add to grow the value of that segment? Scott Wagner : Yeah, thanks. We don't, you know, don't run away from OX and what we've just done with Open Exchange, which is to be able to enable a world class e-mail productivity capabilities that a frankly really low price point. And so that's rolling out across emerging markets and we've doubled unit sales in some of the emerging markets that that's just been recently introduced, and so that's been a really nice execution that we're ramping up around the world. And we're excited about that on what it can do and then per Brent's question around it both digital marketing which really expands categories. Again, there's going to be more to come there to. Ygal Arounian : Great. I guess, I didn't mean to ignore Open-Xchange. I'm just thinking outside of email but, thanks for clarifying. Let me just ask one more on Managed WordPress and you know how you guys see the Managed WordPress product again .obviously you're starting to build out the e-commerce side a lot more, it feels like more of that is starting on the GoCentral side and you know, I understand that Sellbrite will eventually work its way up. How do you see your Managed WordPress and the things you do in there, how they fit in today's more advanced website builder ecosystem especially when it comes to e-commerce? Thanks. Scott Wagner : Great question. So first on Managed WordPress, again for context for those listening that may not know WordPress as well, you know WordPress is far and away the largest online publishing CMS, but obviously built on open source software and there's kind of four principle considerations and ways to add value around WordPress. One of which is site management, plugin updates is the single biggest pain point that any user of WordPress faces. Second is security and then third is sort of performance speed availability of sites themselves. And the fourth is kind of ease of management, simplicity of design, right, inherently as an open source system, you know a simpler framework around design and management. And so are our strategy around WordPress is not a side by side with what we're doing around GoCentral and is really aimed at those four things that we just talked about. And just to highlight what we did with ThemeBeans and CoBlocks both of those bring nice capability around the design making WordPress sites even easier to design and manage. So we're excited about it. Down the road and looking forward, we think there are nice opportunities to blend the capabilities between GoCentral and WordPress, but we'll get to that a little bit in the future. But we see these two things as both critically important and addressing the major needs of not just websites, but really publishing site creation and bringing websites social media and digital marketing together. Ygal Arounian : Thank you. That's really helpful. Operator : Your next question comes from the Naved Khan from SunTrust. Naved Khan : Thanks a lot. I have a couple of questions, so maybe just FX, did the headwinds intensify a bit versus what you guided back in February? And then maybe a high level question on marketplaces. Scott, you know when you acquired Main Street Hub, you kind of spoke about the opportunity there, maybe up to 2 million subscribers could be - could be using over time. Could you sort of give us a big picture opportunity for marketplaces maybe? Ray Winborne : Hi, Naved. It's Ray. I'll take the first one on FX. The headwinds were right in line with what we expected. I think I said two to 250 basis points on the fourth quarter call and it came in here right in the middle there. As we look into the rest of the year as I mentioned on my call comments, we would expect a similar pressure in the second quarter. And then that will balance out over the remainder of the year. Scott Wagner : Thanks. And on Main Street Hub, we've been focused on doing two things with the capability of Main Street Hub. The first of which is product - bringing the product to Main Street Hub, which is really social media reputation, management and it's assisted - assisted reputation management through social and bringing it together with GoDaddy's website building and site creation capabilities. And we're pleased with the progress there. That's one team in our presence unit and it is being set up really well. The second has been to rebrand the Main Street Hub social media services as GoDaddy and introduce it into GoDaddy base. And as you mentioned we had shared a 2 million-ish whitespace or customers that were either buying those services from others or had high interest in it. And as we've rebranded those services as GoDaddy and are starting to introduce it into our base, we're seeing really nice take rate far above what Main Street Hub did on a standalone basis. And I would say that's on top of the acquisition you know pieces in case and so we're you know we're tracking where we want to be. Naved Khan : And just to sort of extrapolate from that. If I look at marketplaces launch e-commerce product what percent of your base you think could be adopters of that over time? Scott Wagner : You could rather than share a specific number. Our potential to grow product commerce is via from the base at which we we're starting is quite high. And again I - would think about ways to frame it as that. Think about the number of WordPress sites that actually sell a product and we think again with a Sellbrite that's a really neat capability to add unique value to WordPress sites in particular. GoDaddy is the largest WordPress - the WordPress host. As Ray mentioned we have over 3 million plug ins and installs, obviously all those are not product commerce, but there's a base of WordPress sites that are product commerce that we think have you know that's the target environment within the base for incremental Sellbrite activity. Naved Khan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Nick Jones from Citi. Nick Jones : Thank you for taking the question. I just want to touch on CoBlocks and ThemeBeans. How big of an opportunity is there for you to consolidate third party plug-in and things like that. I know you present a free deep offering there? Scott Wagner : Thanks. I'm not sure it's consolidation as much as - bring capability to have a world class plug ins within the GoDaddy environment. I mean there's just - there is a lot of opportunity for us to add value for all of the WordPress sites sitting in our base and you know as you mentioned both CoBlocks and ThemeBeans what we're really able to do with those two is we and make the site design process easier, simpler. That's going to be great. And this is a step and we're going to do more - more of these kinds of things around WordPress both organically and in the right spot through M&A to. Nick Jones : And one follow up on the kind of [indiscernible] sub domains, do you know how prevalent that is. Is that something that we need to invest in monitoring or closely or how should we think about that? Scott Wagner : Sorry can I have the question again. I didn't - it wasn't - didn't catch the first part of part of it. Nick Jones : I was asking about the band sub domain? Scott Wagner : We're just regular part of our practice, super tiny number of sites and this is just part of our ongoing legal site review process, but nothing special to call out there and it was a tiny number of sites. Nick Jones : It's a in my closet. Operator : Your next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks for taking the question. This is Seth on for Lloyd. Last quarter you talked about Mexico and Brazil being able to provide an email seat for a $1.50. So we're just wondering how the uptake has been trending there and if there are any levers in the future that you'd be able to pull in order to raise ARPU? And then just as a follow up. It doesn't look like you bought back any stock this quarter last quarter. Just curious as to your updated thoughts on capital allocation and as well as what you're seeing in the M&A markets so far this year? Thank you. Scott Wagner : Sure. On the first we're seeing 2x the level of unit sales and in those markets and we're in the process of rolling out open exchange around the world. Boy it's great to drive unit adoption and usage and you know that'll create a lot of value. So right now we're focused on driving OX adoption into emerging markets around the world. I'll let Ray coming on the second question. Ray Winborne : Yes I mean, you know we can't get into the details around stock buybacks, but we're economically management team. You know as far as capital allocation priorities go they haven't changed. It's organic growth, M&A, share repurchases in that order. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Grant from Goldman Sachs. Mark Grant : Hey, thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to touch on the investments around technology and platform that you've been making we've been talking about for over a year now and really building out that technology platform it seems like those investments are making it easier to make some of these tuck in technology acquisitions and just plug them in and have it work. So whether it's managed WordPress GoCentral, where do you think you are in terms of bringing in all the capabilities that you hope to offer? Are there any features or products that you think the platform is missing that you'd need to focus on? Scott Wagner : You know Mark I wouldn't talk about it as specific feature capabilities. I think there's a couple of things that you're seeing us do if you look at not just feature releases but what we're doing. The first is bringing site creation which was really publishing into the open web, social media presence and digital marketing together. And I could pick off certain features and elements in each one of those categories. But we've got a I think a whole different level of capability that's coming in the intersection of those three things and what we're trying to do at a high level is have somebody whose idea there whether it's business or venture look great. Be everywhere it needs to be and allow somebody to engage with their own audience. And that - those are the customer things that we're driving. And really it cuts across sites social media and digital marketing. And it is an important and the elegant thing about GoDaddy is that we're creating DIY technical tools to allow people to do that in an elegant way. And building a service capability where we can put hands on work for the 50% plus of the world that actually wants somebody else to either build or manage their online presence. And you know that's the strategy and we continue to build capability to fulfill frankly that value proposition. Mark Grant : Thanks. That's very helpful. Operator : That was our last question at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters. Scott Wagner : Hey, everybody thanks for joining us. Appreciate the questions as always and we'll talk to everybody next quarter. Take care. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the GoDaddy Q2 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. Sam Kemp, Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategy, you may begin your conference. Samuel Kemp : Good afternoon, and welcome to GoDaddy's Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. With me today are Scott Wagner, Chief Executive Officer; Ray Winborne, Chief Financial Officer; and Aman Bhutani, who is joining GoDaddy as our next Chief Executive Officer. Scott, Aman and Ray will share some prepared remarks, and then we'll open up the call for questions. Given that Aman will not be starting as CEO until September 4, Scott and Ray will be answering all questions related to strategy, operations and financials. On today's call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and operating metrics such as total bookings, unlevered free cash flow, net debt and ARPU. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents may be found in the presentation posted to our Investor Relations website at investors.godaddy.net or on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC with today's earnings release. Unless otherwise stated, when we refer to organic measures, we're referring to those measures excluding the impact of Main Street Hub. The matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements, which include those related to our future financial results, product introductions and innovations and our ability to execute our leadership transition announced earlier today.  Any forward-looking statements we make on this call are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed in details in our second quarter 10-Q are based on assumptions as of today August 1, 2019, and may differ materially from actual results. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. With that, here's Scott. Scott Wagner : Thanks, Sam. Thanks to everyone for joining us today. As we announced this afternoon, I've been facing health challenges that, after talking with my family and GoDaddy's Board of Directors, require me to make a change in pace and to focus on my health. This was a really, really tough decision for me, but unfortunately, I know I can't maintain the same 110% level of energy, drive, commitment that had GoDaddy first for me for the past 7-plus years and most importantly, what GoDaddy's customers, employees and shareholders deserve going forward. The Board and I have worked methodically to identify a tremendous successor and to lay the groundwork for a smooth transition. I'm honored to introduce everyone to GoDaddy's next CEO, Aman Bhutani.  Aman brings a wealth of experience to GoDaddy. Extraordinary track record in growing a scaled business, deep expertise in product and engineering and consistently strong delivery at scale across both go-to-market and customer conversion. Aman is an exceptional leader and has created strong followings in every organization he's led. Aman is going to fit in great with GoDaddy's culture and our values and bring skills, mindset and experience to lead the company into the future. For the past four years, Aman has been President of Brand Expedia Group leading the Expedia Orbitz, Travelocity, eBookers and Wotif brands. He's built up Expedia's advertising and insurance businesses and has led multiple product and technology teams that serve the entire company. He's highly successful in many areas that are analogous to what we're focused on here at GoDaddy, and he's highly complementary to our existing senior leadership team. So with that, here's Aman to say hello to everyone. Aman? Amanpal Bhutani : Thanks, Scott, and hello to everyone on the call. I look forward to meeting many of you in person soon. I am excited to be here and to have the opportunity to serve GoDaddy's mission, our customer and our employee. GoDaddy stands for the empowerment of the everyday entrepreneur. This is so much more than a brand moniker. It is the philosophical thread that runs throughout the organization from the dynamic progress of what our teams have made, in applications and services, to the power of every one of our 6,000 GoDaddy Guides. I love the spirit of bringing humanity to technology for businesses, nonprofits and all the ideas around the world.  GoDaddy has a really compelling business with a ton of opportunity. It's a great combination between product, go-to-market and a deep care for our customers. Leading GoDaddy into the future is an honor and a privilege.  So I'd like to say thank you to our customers, Scott and the GoDaddy leadership team, the 9,000-plus GoDaddy employees around the world, the Board of Directors and our shareholders for their trust as I take the helm.  Now I'll hand it back to Scott and Ray to review our second quarter. Scott Wagner : Thanks, Aman. It's great to have you here, and I'm excited about the future of GoDaddy under your leadership. Ray and I are going to use the rest of our call for our regular quarterly update with 3 core topics. First, I'll share some of our product ecosystem highlights. Second, I'll cover some recent partnerships of notes. And finally, Ray will cover our financials.  We'll start with product highlights where we've done some fantastic things this quarter and are seeing ongoing strength with GoCentral and Managed WordPress continuing to drive unit growth above 40% on a substantial base as we gain share across the spectrum of site creators. Let me touch on a couple of our most exciting developments. First, we introduced a new GoCentral template interface that delivers unparalleled flexibility during the website building process. With this new interface, creators are able to visualize and rerender content and dozens of different layouts simultaneously. The reason this matters is that builders can experiment and adjust their site at any point in time during the create process even after they're done. This is a breakthrough feature that solves a major point for website creators around the world. GoDaddy is the only website builder in the market with this capability, and the market's response has been extremely positive. Second, GoCentral continues its evolution as a full-fledged marketing and publishing engine that helps customers thrive in a social and digital world. Following integrations with Facebook, Yelp and Google My Business, we've integrated with Instagram so customers can view activity and engagement in GoCentral's marketing dashboards. Our strategy of empowering customers to unify and optimize our online presence has mirrored our Online Store featuring integrations with Amazon, eBay, Etsy and Walmart.com enabling customers to sell products and manage orders, inventory and fulfillment all from one location.  Looking beyond GoCentral, we often get asked about the optionality that exists in partnerships. There's opportunity in both expanding our own products in the third-party ecosystems and bringing the best to GoDaddy customers through tightly integrated partnerships. We did both in the second quarter.  First, we deployed several GoDaddy products into various Amazon solutions, which include our ProTools, which are now available to higher-end WordPress developers using Amazon Lightsail in AWS; GoCentral and SmartLine, which are now available as free trials for Amazon's Business Prime members; and our domain platform, which is in the process of being integrated into AWS and will power AWS' new domain registration. Incidentally, this will make GoDaddy the domain technology provider for all of the major public cloud vendors.  Our second new partnership is with Kabbage, a leading online provider of realtime small business financing. Together, we'll be working to help our customers get access to financing solutions as they face cash flow needs throughout their life cycle. And third, we're expanding our partnership with PayPal customers who cannot only use PayPal as a checkout option but can also use the PayPal Commerce Platform for back-end processing of other funding sources such as credit cards.  These are individually great but what they're showing is that we're accelerating the development of our products into the broader ecosystem at large and are integrating other highly regarded companies' products with the big value propositions packed into the GoDaddy experience. All up, our product lineup is growing in both breadth and depth, and if you haven't poked around in our websites and marketing suite in the last 6 months, or even the last 2 weeks, you're missing out on all that we can do for our customers. As we double down on our product strength, invested behind our brand, honed our experience and scaled up of our conversational marketing efforts into our base, we are becoming increasingly sharp on how we acquire customers and more importantly, how we can do more with them to drive both better success and lifetime value. We're particularly enthusiastic about the 40%-plus growth in GoCentral and Managed WordPress as we know the customers are more engaged with us, spend more over time and stay customers for longer. As I think about Aman coming in and his strength, I'm excited about his future contribution to evolving our product portfolio, expanding websites into marketing and content creation, creating elegant and commercially successful attachment and conversion flows across the GoDaddy experience and putting a scale global technology platform to work across brands.  With that, here's Ray to cover the financials. Ray? Raymond Winborne : Thanks, Scott. We closed out the first half with strong execution on many fronts delivering currency neutral revenue growth of 15% and good trajectory on profitability. We're continuing to balance investments in a number of categories and gets the natural expansion in our business model with a focus on running a business that delivers sustainable top line growth and margin accretion.  Bookings grew to $846 million, rising 14% on a constant currency basis, another acceleration versus first quarter growth. Reported bookings growth was 12% reflecting about 170 basis points of currency headwinds driven by the strengthening U.S. dollars. At today's exchange rates, we expect the marginal bookings headwind in the second half of 2019. Revenue came in at $737 million, growing nearly 15% on a constant currency basis and over 13% on reported basis. Like-for-like revenue growth accelerated 100 basis points from Q1, which reflects strength across the board and in particular, in Presence applications and services.  Our key metrics remain strong reflecting goodness in both ARPU and customer growth. ARPU rose to $153, up 8% year-over-year, and our customer base grew more than 5% to $19 million adding 1 million net new customers in the past year. Let me touch briefly on the optics of our customer metric. We deliberately changed our price and merchandising tactics to optimize for lifetime value. At times, these tactics move customer churn events from period to period and even from year-to-year. This is happening in 2019 such that even with strong renewal rates, net adds are going to be in the 700,000 to 800,000 range for the full year, as is evident, our top line trajectory in Q2 and our revenue growth expectations for the second half. This is a matter of optics and not fundamental performance as our core strategy to maximize LTE is showing up in strong revenue and ARPU growth. Moving to cash flow. Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter up 8% to $168 million with year-to-date growth of 16%, and our trailing 12-month unlevered free cash flow margin expanded to 24%, 1 point higher versus a year ago. Looking into the second half of 2019, we'll continue investing behind our marketing and product efforts, but we'll see year-over-year OpEx growth rates moderate across the board. On the balance sheet, we finished Q2 with $1.2 billion cash and short-term investments. During the quarter, we issued $600 million of unsecured senior notes maturing in 2027 at a fixed rate of 5.25%, which were used to prepay a portion of our existing term loans. And we increased our revolver capacity to $600 million both to bring us more in line with similarly situated companies. Net-net, the impact of these transactions have a negligible impact on net interest expense. We diversified funding sources and extended the maturity profile of our debt.  With that, I'll turn to the outlook for the rest of 2019. We continue to expect full year revenue of $2.97 billion to $3 billion, implying full year growth of 12% to 13%. For the third quarter, we expect revenue of $755 million to $765 million, representing 11% to 13% growth versus the third quarter of 2018. For full year unlevered free cash flow, we expect to generate $730 million to $745 million, representing 1 point to 1.5 points of margin expansion versus 2018. And based on today's interest rates, we expect $80 million to $85 million of cash interest expense in 2019, building slightly faster growth in levered free cash flow. Before we turn it over to Q&A, I'd like to reflect on the incredible evolution of GoDaddy over the past 7 years including the quality and consistency of our business today and how we drive success for our customers. These positive outcomes are a direct result of Scott's strategic direction, good judgment, operating execution and just as importantly, his leadership. On behalf of all of GoDaddy, we thank you and wish the best for both you and your family. And a quick welcome to Aman. We're all excited for you to take the reins for the next leg of our journey. With that, operator, let's open up the call to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein with Oppenheimer. Jason Helfstein : Just one kind of question and then a bigger picture question. And then just before I do that, Scott, it's been a terrific run and just you built a great company and leaving the company in a great place. So I want to echo those words.  So first question, given your comments about net adds and some of the optics, can you give us some comments may be what's happening in gross adds and to the extent you're seeing higher churn on the pricing increases, if there's something positive going on in gross adds? Not asking for you to give that metric now but maybe that's a metric that would be helpful as we're trying to measure marketing efficiency. And then the second, the constant question we have in the company is your plan for capital allocation. I mean you're on your way to effectively have no net leverage in the not-too-distant future. And so really, are you not seeing the right assets available for sale or valuations to high? And if either of the above, why not start buying back stock and just waiting for the right asset to come by? Scott Wagner : Jason, it's Scott. First, thanks for the acknowledgment. I appreciate it. Hey, we're joined by Andrew Low Ah Kee here, our COO. And so on the first part of your question on the customer adds, I'm going to hand it off to Andrew who will give you color and we'll talk about capital allocation. Andrew? Andrew Low Ah Kee : Sure thing. We regularly adjust our different domain offers. Just to put a little color towards this. Sometimes, we use a 1-offer. Sometimes, we use a 2-year offer. That has the effect of deferring customer churn events sometimes. Last year, our net adds, for example, were up over 50% year-over-year because of this effect. Our core pacing remains really healthy. Gross adds -- our Q2 cohort looks to be one of the best-performing ever, and we really haven't seen any impact from price. As Ray mentioned, retention rates are looking really strong. Raymond Winborne : It's Ray. To comment on your question around capital allocation, that has not changed for us. The priorities are the same, and they are in the order of organic, M&A and then share repurchases last. We're going to be disciplined about M&A. We're looking for the right set. It's not just about price. It's got to be a good operational strategy and cultural fit. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Naved Khan with SunTrust. Naved Khan : A couple of questions. Maybe on the gross margin, it went down a little bit. Is there anything to read into that and maybe the components have been driving it down? And the other question I have is on the international growth. It seems sequentially if I look at year-on-year growth for Q2 versus Q1. Is there just a function of how you deploy your marketing orders? Or is there more to it? Raymond Winborne : It's Ray. I'll take the first and then I'll pass it to Andrew for international. Gross margin landed right within our expectations. While you're generally going to see natural accretion from the mix of products, there is variability from quarter-to-quarter based off of a variety of factors. We're managing our product and pricing strategy decisions to deliver incremental dollar growth and with good returns, irrespective of the margin percentage. And as I've mentioned to you guys on past calls, that mid-60s percentage is what you should be plugging into the models going forward. Andrew Low Ah Kee : And then Naved, on international growth, it's exactly what you cited, which is around where we're our marginal marketing expense. It's what we talked about last quarter. As we built out the conversational marketing engine primarily focused in the U.S., we're seeing great return. We manage our spend globally, and so we're putting it against the highest return opportunities, which still continues to see a tremendous amount of opportunity across international, but frankly, we love the returns we're seeing in the U.S. right now. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Grant with Goldman Sachs. Mark Grant : Just hoping if you could give us a little bit of an update on what you're seeing around SmartLine and Main Street Hub. the partnership with AWS, obviously, is encouraging, and the free trial is available there from SmartLine. But have you see any changes in -- whether new customers coming in for new trials or any impact to the 31-day churn metric? Scott Wagner : It's Scott. So SmartLine, first of all. So on SmartLine, we're still working through the value proposition on it. There's a huge need at the top of the funnel. And if you think about SmartLine right now, you have second line number in voice, and what we're really focusing on it's actually building it out in terms of messaging. And we think that, that is really the product need in the fulsome nature of -- and what customers need is a second number that's actually tied into the broader way that our customers have to reach and talk to their customers. And so we're spending our time and energy thinking not about just SmartLine as a voice service but particularly extending it into an integration messaging platform.  But when you just spend time watching our customers interact, this is a big, big opportunity, and so we're throwing our shoulder against it. On Main Street Hub, it's been a really nice shape. So at this point, we have one integrated team in business working through assisted, not only website creation, but maintenance and paid social media services so it's all one operation between websites and marketing. And we're seeing, frankly, great results as we integrate operations and particularly as we bring kind of this integrated value proposition to the GoDaddy base. So punchline is we've got top line growing nicely. We're starting to drive growth and now we're really focused on scaling. It's a nice shape. Mark Grant : Scott, certainly all the best to you and your family going forward. Scott Wagner : Thanks. I appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Brent Thill : Scott, you got a lot of fans. Stay strong. I had a question for Aman. You have a very strong product background and I'm just curious if you could just give us your vision of this migration from the domain applications and how you see this. And I know it's early, but it seems like there's a lot of questions we get around the application side. And I have a quick follow-up for Ray at the end. Amanpal Bhutani : This is Aman. It's not even day 1 for me yet. What I will tell you is when I look at the GoDaddy strategy, we're focusing on the conversion funnels, getting the marketing working well, increasing the product portfolio and then being able to run multiple brands on the strong technology platform, those blinking really well to my background. So I'll be excited to share more with you and everyone else as I get on board and learn more about the business. But going in, it seems like a good match for the expertise I bring to the table. Brent Thill : Ray, on cash flow missed The Street by 10 %. It's definitely more back-end-loaded. Can you just talk through this? And I'm getting a number of questions from your investors. It's been three quarters. You got $500 million in the buyback. You haven't touched your share, stocks lag both indexes in the peer group. Just the question is what's the holding pattern for? Raymond Winborne : Look at the top line. We've got good solid metrics in growth this quarter. On unlevered free cash flow, we're about 50% of the way towards our annual guide. So no concerns around cash flow. It's just timing of quarters against consensus. So I get no concerns there. As I mentioned earlier, the capital allocation priorities have not changed. We can continue to grow this organic -- this business organically. We are looking for M&A, but it's got to be the right fit and share repurchases will come into the picture, but it's in that order. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty with JPMorgan. Sterling Auty : Let me also start, Scott. I mean hell of a job, not only as CFO but CEO and really advancing new culture and the progress of the company. Congratulations. Thoughts and prayers to you and the family. Moving back to the business. If I look at slightly slower growth in the customer additions, which was mentioned before, but the bookings coming in at the really nice level. You mentioned a couple of elements. I'd love for you to kind of rank order, where do you think you're kind of punching above your weight class in terms of getting the extra bookings per new customer coming out to the platform? Scott Wagner : It's Scott. I think we're seeing a combination of things. One is slightly better attach, right, during the initial conversion flow and funnel. The second is back to this effort of conversational marketing into the base. We really do have now the science of what are each one of our customers doing, not only with GoDaddy's products, but others and where are they in their life cycle. And it's really honing in on, \"Boy, how do we put the next thing in front of them at the right time?\" And again, I think you're using the old baseball analogy, we're probably in the second inning of actually scaling up that capability. But as we make progress there, that shows up in ARPU, and it particularly shows up in some of the more advanced application products. Really, it's kind of those two things. And from a product category standpoint, it's showing up a little bit more in hosting and presence and further script comments 40% unit growth in GoCentral and Managed WordPress, obviously, those show up nicely and are probably the big areas of incremental growth. Sterling Auty : Great. And then one follow-up question. You mentioned the partnership and AWS integration. If you go back all the way to the time of the IPOs, there was first concern about Google Domains and obviously, it had a great partnership with Microsoft, et cetera, I thought some of us said that this gives you all 3 major clouds integrated. Can you give us a sense of how much of the domain flow comes from the existing relationships that you had? And what might we expect as you add AWS in that equation? Scott Wagner : Scott again. So across all of those partners, it's a small, small contribution. I mean the vast, vast majority right off of our Domains are GoDaddy proper. We're the marketplace for naming and frankly, it not going to change for a long time. This is more about just strong relationships with the ecosystem, and so it's obviously a great nod to our Domains team with a breadth of names that are carried plus the speed and sophistication frankly of our APIs that the other cloud providers are using our domain technology to power some, if not all, their Domains in their own cloud offering. But it's tiny relative to the P&L and honestly, it's not going to show up in our financials or our top line, but it's just a really important part of us being part of the broader ecosystem. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau with William Blair. Matthew Pfau : Best wishes to you and your family, Scott. So I wanted to ask on the website products, it seems so nice growth there on both the WordPress and the GoCentral offerings. Maybe you could just give us a more detail on what's the driver there? You made a lot of functionality enhancements so I suspect that's part of it, but there's also been some changes from others in the market around pricing and other things. So just wondering what the bigger -- biggest factors there are in the continued strong growth. Scott Wagner : First and foremost, there's, I'd say, feature functionality product quality richness that, really over the last year, has really amplified. And in terms of how that translates into business, really, the first thing is more awareness not only within the GoDaddy base but in the broader market. And again, that's something that's going to be a multiyear effort, but just awareness of the capability that we have is a big thing. And obviously, the second is better attach. Just working our flows that I'd say we're still in the early innings of it and have a lot of upside. Relative to those 2 products, price isn't driving any of the uptick. It's all quality attach. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan with Barclays. Deepak Mathivanan : Scott, I wanted to go out with comments. Great run. We, and I'm sure your investors, really appreciate your time at GoDaddy. Two questions from us. What is the payment period on this marketing spend any different than some other incremental expenditures before. Bookings growth is really strong, but curious if marketing is seeing -- you're seeing any marketing investments. And do we expect a period where this sort of normalizes over the next few quarters?  And then second question is on GoCentral. Can you provide some color on what geographies are kind of driving this growth. You never quantified but perhaps, could you give some color on size of growth of the GoCentral business currently? Scott Wagner : It's Scott. First, thanks for the comment. I appreciate it. On the relative return of conversational marketing, we don't get into the specifics on individual components of our marketing channels. I think they really are complementary versus either completely different lanes. But again, you can't think about incremental spend going against the base, and we have return thresholds on it. And needless to say, everything we're doing is economically accretive and has really good return. We're looking for ways to keep spending money against these kinds of opportunities and against these areas. Investors, not only we as a business, but investors would actually want us continuing to spend more. This is about just honing and scaling how we do this.  Your second question on GoCentral, it is a part of the hosting and presence line. And obviously, if that's growing 40%, you, can see the overall aggregate, GoCentral from a revenue contribution is still it's small -- a small but meaningful component of that line, and it really is the big reason for the ongoing strength in that segment. So when you're looking at the growth in that segment line, think about that as coming almost all from GoCentral. And in terms of where, kind of followed the developed world. U.S. is the strongest, and then core English markets are next. That's where we're putting our shoulder, and there's a lot of runway really and just those geographies. I think that covers everything. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ron Josey with JMP Securities. Andrew Boone : This is Andrew Boone for Ron. You guys have historically talked about 1 million net adds per year on average. I understood of the color on kind of the contract issues, but is that the level that we should expect going forward that we get back at once we get through this? And then secondly, just on your Amazon partnership, really interesting can you take a step back and talk about what you look for in third-party partners? Scott Wagner : It's Scott. So on the first one, on net adds, you look at this on a 2-year stack. A year ago, as Andrew was describing, there was 1.2 million. Ray talked about how things were going to layer throughout the year that kind of normalizes around that when 1 million number over that 2-year period of time. I think the most important point is that the underlying renewal rate at cohort basis and customer basis, not only has it changed, but it's tweaky getting better, meaning small amounts. So the fundamentals of cohort retention frankly haven't changed. And more importantly, the value of each cohorts are increasing. And honestly are in really nice shape.  I think your second question around partnerships, number one, there is our value proposition from a product and the customer job that matches the needs of our customer base. The second is that we can execute that really tight integration with fantastic CX or customer experience. If you think about what we've done with Microsoft 365, I mean, boy, that's the gold standard of really [indiscernible] a great product [Technical Difficulty] This is Scott. Currently, we had a little bit of a telecom issue through the central place, and now we are back. I think we were talking about partnerships. Basically, this is a big value proposition and tight CX. And Microsoft 365's, obviously, the gold standard of it. And what you're seeing in those other categories are the same execution. Operator : Your next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley with Deutsche Bank. Seth Gilbert : This is Seth on for Lloyd. Two if I may. One, to touch on the Amazon partnership, maybe ask me a little bit differently. Is there anything in the contract with your partnership them that prohibits them from competing with you down the road in any way?  And then second question, apologies if I missed it, just wondering about marketing and advertising and also G&A a little bit elevated in the quarter compared to what we're modeling. And I was just curious if there's any onetime expenses to call out or maybe something with conversational marketing. And best wishes to you and your family, Scott. Scott Wagner : On the specifics, we're not going to get into the partnership details, but we feel good about this. We have a great value proposition. These partnerships are going to continue for a long period of time. It'll be good. On the marketing spend, Ray is going to pick it up on marketing. Raymond Winborne : For marketing, we're so confident for our year, even if this is the lowest point in a year. Don't forget the G&A line as a litigation settlement, I think. Also it's a [indiscernible] Operator : Next question comes from the line of Zachary Schwartzman with RBC Capital Markets. Zachary Schwartzman : First, Scott, like what others said on the call, best wishes for a full and healthy recovery. On the net customer adds, now it's 700,000, 800,000 from the, call it, 1 million net adds that has been briefly discussed. Are some of the changes in addition that Ray referenced will -- that are layered in the back half, are they going to be more margin accretive to the bottom line, given that revenue guidance sort of wasn't picked up here, but there's a lower -- but there's lower net adds like things like ARPU should expand? Scott Wagner : Yes, Zach. And again, these are quarter-to-quarter changes, the purpose is around managing lifetime value. And that doesn't flow on the calendar year. That's on -- if you think about it on a 12-month forward basis. And yes, we particularly focus on some of the higher value customers' ARPU, that's what you're seeing from not only our revenue performance. But again, the margin accretion that's not like a quarter-to-quarter thing, but the relationship between customers ARPU should work in the way that you described it. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I turn the call over to Scott Wegner. Scott Wagner : All right. Hey, everybody. Appreciate it. And in closing, I want to say thank you, to everybody. In particular, thank you to the GoDaddy employees who are listening on the call and have been here with all of us for day in, day out for a long time. And particularly thank you to the investment community both in the sell and buy sides. Our dialogue over the past 4-plus years has been consistently both thoughtful and respectful. Good companies are always evolving as GoDaddy no doubt will, but one constant will be transparency and the view towards building a well-rounded business that delivers for customers, shareholders and employees. And thanks, everybody. I really appreciate it and good luck going forward. I know it will be a huge success. Thanks, everybody. Operator : This concludes today's conference call.

After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Sam Kemp, Vice President of Investor Relations and Strategy. Thank you. Please go ahead. Samuel Kemp : Good afternoon. And thank you for joining us for GoDaddy's third quarter 2019 earnings conference call. With me today are Aman Bhutani, Chief Executive Officer; and Ray Winborne, Chief Financial Officer. Aman and Ray will share some prepared remarks and then we will open up the call for your questions. On today's call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and operating metrics, such as total bookings, unlevered free cash flow, net debt and ARPU. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents may be found in the presentation posted to our Investor Relations website at investors.godaddy.net or on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC with today's earnings release. Unless otherwise stated, when we refer to organic measures, we're referring to those measures excluding the impact of Main Street Hub. The matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements, which include those related to future financial results, product introductions and innovations as well as our share repurchase authorizations. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed in detail in our third quarter 10-Q are based on assumptions as of today, November 6, 2019, and may differ materially from actual results. We undertake no obligations to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. With that, here's Aman. Amanpal Bhutani : Thanks, Sam. And welcome everybody to our third quarter earnings call. It's great to speak with you all. My first two months at GoDaddy have been an excellent experience. That's affirmed what I believed about the company and everything we have ahead of us. Today, I want to share with you what I see in GoDaddy, the points of differentiation that allow us to capitalize on our opportunity, and lastly the principles behind how we will achieve our goals, which nicely align our customer and shareholder priorities. Even as an outsider, I was drawn to GoDaddy, a customer-centric company whose massive global brand and noble purpose delivered terrific economics. And after just two weeks on the job, as I stood in front of our customers at our very first customer event, launching websites plus marketing our new product that relationship we have with our customers was palpable. I took the opportunity to spend some time with them. One of them was Sharelle. She has an influencer business and was so eager to support our event that she brought along her mother and her two year old child. Three generations, I found that to be powerful and representative of our customers, as they juggle between their business venture and everything else in life. What we do, everything we do is to make her and millions like her successful. Sharelle has been with GoDaddy for five years. She has two websites, spends about $200 a year, and wants to be doing a lot more with us. Our biggest goal is finding more customers. But even for an influencer, marketing is not straightforward. Sharelle is not alone. Everyday entrepreneurs have a fundamental need to amplify and grow their businesses, but we know that finding and engaging customers has gotten more complicated, as consumers want to engage across an increasingly fragmented landscape. Technology has created this complexity, but paired with humanity, technology can also solve it with simplicity. And that's the GoDaddy passion and opportunity, to simplify the world for our customers. And for the millions like Sharelle, there is a real lack of options. We hear repeatedly that it doesn't feel like anyone is supporting their unique needs. And they are right. Our customers have real commercial needs, but cannot embrace tools designed for the enterprise. This is where our scale gives them a huge advantage. Servicing the everyday entrepreneur is hard, but with scale, we have turned difficulty into success. We are the world leader in online presence. We have the world's largest paid website ecosystem. We run over a quarter of the world's domains, and we are a massive provider of online communications through our branded email offerings. We also have a deep understanding of our customers. Thanks to the nearly 2 million conversations we have each month, and the insights we have on the web presence of tens of millions of micro businesses. The sheer scale of our business, customer interactions, and data gives us the ability to iterate rapidly a huge resource to apply to our evolution. And importantly, GoDaddy has already demonstrated its ability to extend what we do for our customers. With robust products like Managed WordPress and Websites + Marketing, which now has over 1 million paid subscriptions after just a couple of years in market. GoDaddy is making fast progress on our shift from an infrastructure-focused company to a customer-led software company. This is a rare transition, given the real challenge of simultaneously shifting both product and brand. GoDaddy's success here is an extraordinary point of affirmation that we do have that capability and we can continue to extend how we serve our customers' needs, growing ARPU over time. All in, we're looking at a time in the hundreds of billions, which will keep us busy for years to come. The way we win these opportunities for both our customers and for you, our shareholders is by being laser-focused on GoDaddy's three biggest competitive advantages. Our ethos of guidance, seamlessly intuitive experiences, and activating our community. Let me touch on each as they relate to our operating and strategic priorities we're aligning around as a company. First, there is guidance, which is deeply embedded into the ethos of GoDaddy, thanks to our 6,000 plus GoDaddy guys all around the world. Entrepreneurs plays high value on informed advice and direction, which we're infusing into everything we do. At our recent customer event, we unveiled a new feature of Websites + Marketing called InSight, which puts our guidance directly into our products. Our customer using our InSight dashboard is very specific, tailored marketing actions that allow them to take the next steps in growing their business. InSight provides tested recommendations drawn from our customer graph, which helps entrepreneurs learn from one another's success. As I look around the company, I see many places where we can use guidance to expand our role as a growth partner. Our second advantage is seamlessly intuitive experiences that make things easier for our customers. Entrepreneurs wear a number of hats just to keep the lights on, which makes time their constraint, and complexity their enemy. We break down these barriers by radically simplifying our products, making everything from site building to marketing easy, improving the outcomes for our customers, and minimizing the work they have to do. Take for example, our latest version of Managed WordPress, which shipped in October and has received stellar accolades from the community for how intuitive and accessible we've made WordPress. In the set of process alone, we've eliminated 70% of the standard WordPress install steps without compromising its power or flexibility. As we think about 2020 and beyond, seamlessly intuitive experiences will include uniting our products around ultimate customer outcomes as we move from an A la carte experience towards integrated suites. And the third advantage, I see playing out longer term is GoDaddy's potential to activate our community, which is comprised of our 19 million customers across a diverse set of populations, verticals and geographies. We have only just begun tapping into this advantage. But as I look at our customers, their needs and our scale, I believe there is a huge opportunity to connect our communities in ways that generate real benefits for them, and for us. Given our priorities and our advantages, I just discussed, I hope you can see how well aligned our customer and shareholder outcomes are. Well let me turn for a moment to our execution. As we look to 2020, I can confidently say that our biggest priorities are delivering a stronger platform, increasing our pace of experimentation, and ultimately accelerating the delivery of the product experiences and outcomes that empower our customers. As I have gotten deeper into the business, I see a lot of promising ideas and talented teams, and the clear potential to move a lot faster, with a particular focus on platform and product. First, our platform sits below everything we do. It enables our marketing engine, customer experiences, how our products work together and the automation layer that drives constant improvement. In my 20 plus years of experience, I've seen firsthand the enormous organic and inorganic value unlocked by a scalable, durable and powerful platform. And this is absolutely true at GoDaddy. We're enhancing our platform, we will increase our velocity, delight our customers, and more seamlessly unlock value across the business. Second, to deliver the simplest and best experiences, interfaces and customer outcomes, we need to have exceptional products, which I'm sure is intuitive to everyone on this call. Coming into GoDaddy, I'm pleasantly surprised at how far GoDaddy's products have come and in 2020 and beyond, we will be leaning into the quality of our core offerings and expanding the ways we enable customer success. The combination of a strong platform and exceptional products yields the ability to accelerate our value delivery to customers and importantly produce meaningful financial outcomes. With that in mind, our approach will be financially principal and prudent with regard to allocating our people's time, our P&L, and our balance sheet. As I wrap, I want to leave you with three important points. One, GoDaddy sits in a privileged position relative to a massive opportunity. Two, our brand is differentiated in the minds of our customers, and we will be leaning into guidance, seamlessly intuitive experiences, and activating our community. And three, our execution focus will be on strengthening our platform, increasing our experimentation, and continually accelerating our product. These are the underpinnings of our ability to increase value to our customers and financial outcomes for our shareholders for years to come. And with that, here's Ray to cover our quarter's financials. Raymond Winborne : Thanks, Aman. I'll touch on the financial results for the quarter, and the outlook for the rest of the year. We delivered another solid quarter with great top line performance, while driving operating leverage, and deploying $459 million in capital to repurchase over 7 million shares of our own equity. On the top line, revenue came in at $761 million, growing 13% on a constant currency basis, and 12% on a reported basis, decelerating about 100 basis points as we lapped the acquisition of Main Street Hub. On a like-for-like basis, we continue to deliver strength across the business, including our Presence suite, Productivity and our Domains business. International revenue was $254 million in Q3, growing 12% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. And looking at revenue metrics, ARPU rose to $155, up 7% year-over-year, and our customer base grew 4.5% to $19.1 million, in line with our expectations. Bookings grew to $851 million, rising 15% on a reported basis. Currency headwinds created a point of pressure in the quarter, and were stronger than we anticipated earlier in the year. Separately, during the quarter, we experienced a spike in credit card abuse, which created 1 point of lift in total bookings, the nets out and refunds does not impact net bookings or revenue. Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter was $191 million, growing 9% year-over-year, and was negatively impacted by the timing of CapEx spend between Q3 and Q4 last year. We expect full year 2019 capital expenditures to be roughly in line with 2018. On the balance sheet, we finished Q3 with $990 million in cash and short-term investments. Net debt landed at $1.4 billion or about 2x net leverage on a trailing 12 month basis. Since our last earnings call, we deployed $459 million in capital repurchasing 7.1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of just under $65 a share. This repurchase represents nearly 4% reduction in fully diluted shares outstanding. Additionally, the Board of Directors recently approved a repurchase authorization for an incremental $500 million, bringing our total repurchase capacity to $541 million. On the debt side of the capital structure, in October, we refinanced $1.85 billion in term loans, reducing our interest spread by 25 basis points and lowering annual cash interest payments by roughly $4.6 million dollars. As our cash flow and balance sheet capacity expands, you'll continue to see us be thoughtful stewards of capital, with the ultimate goal of prudently driving attractive growth and levered free cash flow for our shareholders. With that, let's turn to our outlook for the rest of 2018. We are updating our full year revenue guidance to $2.98 billion to $2.99 billion, or full year growth of 12% at the midpoint, squarely where we expected, as we entered 2019. For full year unlevered free cash flow, we are adjusting our range slightly to $730 million to $740 million, reflecting continued currency headwinds on bookings. The midpoint represents more than a point of margin expansion versus 2018, reflecting our ability to balance both top line growth and margins. Based on today's interest rates, we expect approximately $80 million of cash interest in 2019, yielding slightly faster growth in levered free cash flow. In closing, we have a distinctive value proposition that combines our products, platform and guidance to uniquely serve our customers, and help them grow their business, while minimizing complexity. There is a huge opportunity in serving the needs of the everyday entrepreneur, and we're excited about delivering on the promise of making the GoDaddy experience seamlessly intuitive. With that, operator, let's open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is open. Brent Thill : Thank you. For Aman, just if you could talk through some of the early adoption you're seeing in websites and marketing that -- the launch that just came out and it'd be great to get a color there. And then second -- secondarily for Ray, you took the high end of guidance down both in revenue and cash flow. And I just wanted to confirm that's just all FX related nothing organically related. Thank you. Amanpal Bhutani : Thanks, Brent. I'll take the first part. On Websites + Marketing, it's just been a fantastic launch for us with new features going in this year. Just to remind everyone, we launched the product about a couple of years ago, and we are already at 1 million subscribers here. The key things we've seen since the launch is, a greater interest in the new features, the InSight feature is something that I called out specifically, which we think over time is a game changer, as everyday entrepreneurs go to this product and it actually guides them through, what their next step should be. And with that, Ray, on the secondary. Raymond Winborne : Hi, Brent, it's Ray. On the revenue guidance, all we did was tightened down the full year range from $30 million to $10 million. So the midpoint stay the same there, just the currency wasn't is impactful to revenue. So I mentioned in the call comments, we pulled down the top end of unlevered free cash flow. We've left that range of $730 million to $745 million out there all year. But as we've moved into the back half, currency has been a little bit of a pressure on bookings. So we thought it was prudent to tighten that up. Brent Thill : Great, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from Deepak Mathivanan of Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is open. Deepak Mathivanan : Great, thanks for taking the question. Aman, nice to hear your vision for the company. Investors are waiting to hear about it for a while, and it's very refreshing. So, thanks for that. Translating it into financial context, how should we think about GoDaddy's historical targets to deliver steady double-digit top line growth versus free cash flow in the high teens plus. Do you still believe in that financial framework or what are your thoughts on that? And then second question sort of related to that, to your point on guidance to the customer, what does it entail operationally, is that a customer support team that's bigger in size or is that marketing related? How do you plan to achieve it operationally? Thank you. Amanpal Bhutani : Thanks, Deepak. It's too early for me to get into the specific financial guidance for 2020 and beyond. I think broadly on the framework, we had put up long-term target of $5 billion revenue for the company, and I am super excited for GoDaddy to be that and bigger. And in general, if the statements were, do we like the idea of more customers and selling them more? I would say definitely, but the key for me is that we, as we get bigger that we're clear about what the -- the customer that we are approaching, and we know that the customers that engage with us more, buying more products tend to have higher lifetime value, which means they get more from us and they also generate better financial returns. And in terms of guidance in the product, we will definitely talk more about over time, but the example of InSight is very good -- the example of the InSight product is very good in terms of letting an entrepreneur come to the site and say, hey, you know, other people like you are doing this as their next step. You should do that too. And what that does is, it broadens guidance from our core of having the 6,000 GoDaddy guys to our digital products as well. And we will report on 2020 when we report Q4 as we have done in the past. Deepak Mathivanan : Okay, that's fair. Thank you very much, Aman. Operator : Your next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Please go ahead, your line is open. Jackson Ader : Okay, great. This is actually Jackson Ader on for Sterling tonight. Thanks for taking my question. It's really about the renewal rates in the quarter, how they trended relative to maybe what we've been seeing over the last couple of quarters. And then also, I think in the last quarter, you talked about some of the two year renewal cycles, going back to 2017 kind of having an impact on this. So we're just curious, when should we see that headwind start to subside and maybe actually see net additions accelerate on the back of that headwind subsiding? Amanpal Bhutani : Yes, thanks, Jack. Let me quickly introduce Andrew Low Ah Kee, our Chief Operating Officer, who is on the call with us and I think took it last quarter as well. Andrew? Andrew Low Ah Kee : Yes, absolutely. Renewal rates continue to track really well for us. That's driven by two things. One, our focus on driving more active usage of the products that we have that we know that when customers are actively engaged as Aman meant -- that as Aman mentioned that that turns into more retention, more lifetime value for us. So that's one. And then second, we've had a team out there really staring at a renewal experience, trying to take friction out, trying to make the experience more seamless for our customers, and we find that focus on customer experience. That actually turns into strong renewals as well. So we continue to be enthusiastic and excited about what we're seeing on the renewal front. Raymond Winborne : Hi, Jackson, it's Ray. As far as the pace on the 700,000 to 800,000 customer adds in 2019, we still see that happening, but we're not going to guide beyond 2020. Jackson Ader : Okay, fair enough. And then just a quick follow-up, I guess it's in a similar vein, we've seen some other competitors kind of trying to come up market, any just commentary or initial commentary on maybe what you're seeing in the Hosting and Presence business relative to the -- to those competitors? Amanpal Bhutani : I think we're enthusiastic right now based on what we're seeing in websites and marketing crossing 1 million subscriptions. Our Managed WordPress offering has been doing really well and we've been excited by what we're seeing there. So we think as we've really applied focus in this area that we're seeing good outcomes for ourselves. Jackson Ader : All right, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Mark Grant of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open. Mark Grant : Hi, thank you for taking the question. Just a couple of quick ones from me. Just diving a little bit deeper on the hosting business there, just given the strength that you've called out in websites and marketing, can you help us understand the other moving pieces that might be preventing that segment from seeing the kind of growth, the growth you're seeing in websites and marketing and Managed WordPress. And then, Ray, kind of a bigger picture one, as we get a little bit closer to the event horizon on taxes, and we're trying to model out the various puts and takes there. Can you walk us through your expectations for the tax impact both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis and the cash impact over the next couple of years? Thank you. Amanpal Bhutani : Thanks, Mark. We, like we say, we continue to see strength with Websites + Marketing and Managed WordPress products together seeing unit growth of 40% plus. So that's been great for us and of course the 1 million subscribers for Websites + Marketing is a great milestone for us. And Ray. Raymond Winborne : Yes. So Mark just to finish off. You know we just left the acquisition of Main Street Hub this quarter, obviously that's reported in that Hosting and Presence line. If you just looked at the absolute quantum of growth on the Hosting and Presence revenue was up, call it $35 million last quarter, it's up $22 million this quarter. Most of that difference is your lapping of the acquisition. On your other question with respect to the TRA. The only change in our outlook for the TRA, since our 2018 Investor Day is it -- now we have fixed virtually all of the TRA benefit and liability. In total, over the life of the TRA, it will be a $1.8 billion payment stream. In the latest forecast, we put together, which we update in our quarterly filings each time by the way, we begin ramping payments in 2022. For modeling purposes, by 2023 I would put in [20%] [ph] plus or minus of traditional EBITDA excluding the impact of stock-based compensation, and assume today's capital structure for that when you do it. Hopefully, I gave you a little more color on -- on what to put in there. Mark Grant : Thank you very much. Yes, very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Nick Jones of Citi. Please go ahead, your line is open. Nick Jones : Hi, thank you for taking my question. Kind of given some of the product rollouts and how would you look at kind of your product portfolio today. And is there any area that you think there may be holes, whether it's in marketing or e-commerce or another area? Amanpal Bhutani : Yes, thanks, Nick. When I look at the needs of our customers, their needs are in many, many areas. So, definitely, I feel that over time, we can add to the rest of the products that we have. When I look at our product suite today, I think we have a compelling offering, and our focus over the next year is to really make that seamlessly intuitive for them as they go across it. Having said that, we've continued to add in more offerings with some small tuck-in acquisitions over time to, and we'll continue to do that because customers are calling us, they're telling us all the time of the things they need, and we have the ability to go back into the suite and offer to them in a manner that works for them. Nick Jones : Thanks. One quick follow-up. You seem to understand your customer heads pretty well. How does -- are you able to find and acquire these customers through different channels and maybe some of your competitors that have kind of turnkey solutions that are very kind of vertically focused. How should we think about how you do it yourself or can kind of differentiate between the different offerings that are -- some are becoming more robust, or are they more vertically integrated? Andrew Low Ah Kee : Nick, I think the biggest thing that we have from a customer acquisition perspective going for us is our brand. We've invested hundreds of millions, if not billions over nearly two decades as a company, and we've got a differentiated position not just here in the US but truly globally around the world and that brand strength is actually what drives the vast majority of our customer acquisitions, and importantly and excitingly, we're actually seeing real growth in our core brand health metrics as we've rolled out a new set of creative executions in positioning. So we're enthusiastic not just about the asset, we have in our brand but how we continue to invest and grow it. Nick Jones : Great, thank you for taking my questions. Operator : Your next question comes from Ron Josey of JMP Securities. Please go ahead, your line is open. Ron Josey : Great, thanks for taking the question. Aman, maybe just going back to the broader strategy, and you talked about stronger -- benefits of a stronger platform and increased [indiscernible] and the product as key focus areas. I wanted to see sort of how you think about those three things relative to what you saw at Expedia and you did at Expedia in terms of conversion flows and marketing and sort of see how you bring those learning's from Expedia to GoDaddy along those three things. And when you talk about a stronger platform, I immediately started thinking, okay, well, it will be an upgrade cycle or whatever but maybe any insights on, on how advanced maybe GoDaddy's infrastructure is now? And what's needed here as you layer on new products? Thank you. Amanpal Bhutani : Thanks, Ron. Definitely over the last 20 years, I've seen the power of platforms and in previous role and role before that as well. And the -- a growing, evolving platform can bring both organic and inorganic benefits to any company. And I would say GoDaddy has done a pretty good job over the years, growing the platform and has seen some benefits. But there are a couple of areas where I would like to focusing on, and I think with time, energy and talent, we can do a better job in those areas. And it will unlock new opportunities for us. When I think about items like conversion flows and such, I would say GoDaddy's experience has really improved over the last couple of years. But again, it's an area where we are putting in a lot more attention and making sure that we're just raising the level of experimentation, so that we can have more attempts out there, more try the goal, and hence have more winners. And we think this really brings together what customers need because with every experiment, a customer clicks and tells you whether they like it or not, and that sort of brings together what customers need and what creates value for the company and shareholders as well. Ron Josey : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Zachary Schwartzman of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead, your line is open. Zachary Schwartzman : Great, thanks for taking my question. Aman, in the press release and your prepared remarks, you spoke about a focus on increasing experimentation and continually accelerating the product for customers. As we look into the future, from a qualitative level, what areas of the business, do you feel you can generate the greatest incremental value from, whether that's tech and dev, customer care, marketing or maybe somewhere else? And then I have a quick follow-up. Amanpal Bhutani : Yes. Thank you, Zach for that question. I would say experimentation and the application of the scientific method for me has worked in all of the areas that you just talked relative to marketing, care or tech and dev, and in terms of where to start my experience has been the place to start is where the customer touch point is. That's where the maximum return is and that's where we're focusing our teams to make sure that we're sort of resourcing those teams strongly so that they're able to go after that bigger opportunity. Zachary Schwartzman : Got it, thanks. So as investors think about this shift from infrastructure to a customer-led software company as you mentioned, how do you think about I guess re-allocating resources, maybe in product development. Is this a greater area of focus? I think investors are wondering if you can do this without having to spend higher than in prior years', given GoDaddy's attractive margin profile and robust cash flow generation. Amanpal Bhutani : Yes, thanks, Zach. I would say, my early observation has been that GoDaddy has been investing in a number of places over the last year or two. And although it's too early for me to just be super specific of one area or the other, I'll just call out like I said in my prepared remarks that we were economic being here, and we're going to be diligent stewards of our P&L. Zachary Schwartzman : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt Pfau of William Blair. Please go ahead, your line is open. Matthew Pfau : Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. Wanted to ask a bit on your e-commerce initiatives, and it seems like you're leaning a bit more into the e-commerce market with the SellBrite acquisition as well as the WooCommerce partnership that you just announced. So just curious as to what you're seeing in this market that's making you perhaps put a bit more focus on it than you have in the past? Andrew Low Ah Kee : Sure. Matt, look, e-commerce is an area where, as our customers start with us and then begin to grow, we'd be foolish not to grow with them. And in the spirit of Aman's comments around the ethos of guidance, when we see our WordPress customers installing WooCommerce, gee! We ought to go serve that need. Similarly on the websites and marketing side of things, we see more and more customers wanting to transact online, but really uncertain about how to go about it. And so by deeply integrating commerce experiences, not just product but also service commerce and our online appointments and bookings offering, that's just, that's just delivering on our promise of guidance to our customers. Matthew Pfau : Okay. And so I guess it's more of what you're seeing in the customer base than something in terms of maybe the competition changes, creating opportunities or anything along those lines? Amanpal Bhutani : No, look, we find, we find we're at our best when we're listening closely to our customers, whether that's what they're telling us in the 2 million interactions we have each month or whether it's based on looking at how they're using our products. Matthew Pfau : Okay, great. That's it from me. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from Naved Khan of SunTrust. Please go ahead, your line is open. Nathan Mitchell : Hi, this is Nathan Mitchell on for Naved. Maybe first, just if you could touch on gross margins for the quarter, came in again a bit lower than last quarter, a bit lower than we had and how we should think about gross margins in 4Q? And then my second question is just around Verisign. It seems like they're pretty close to getting approval for the dot com price increase. We're wondering how we should think about the impact to GoDaddy and GoDaddy customers? Raymond Winborne : Nathan, it's Ray. I'll take the first one. It's just normal quarter-to-quarter fluctuations and gross margin was right in line with our expectations for that mid-60s range that I have been pointing you guys at quarter after quarter. Fundamentally, we haven't made any changes in the nature of our COGS, either to the fees we pay the registries or order software license fees with partners. One other point I might make around gross margin. Remember the margin impact of currency is pretty high flow-through, given that a lot of our COGS is USD-based. That's another factor as you look at the changes quarter-over-quarter that could be heading up. And on the second point, as you well know, Nate, dot com continues to be the most important TLD in the world, and it is still a valuable product at a value price point. And historically, the industry has passed price increases to consumers. And although it's too early for us to be specific about our pricing strategies in 2020, I think we have the history of how things have worked. Amanpal Bhutani : Yes. And just in terms of the industry's historic ability to pass through that price increase, it's helpful that you ask the question, why is that. And in reality, a domain name is actually in many cases deeply coupled and tied to an individual's dream. And when you think about the price increase of $1 or $2 relative to giving up on their dream that's a relatively easy trade. Nathan Mitchell : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Ygal Arounian of Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead, your line is open. Ygal Arounian : Thanks for the questions. So you gave the number, the 1 million subscribers for websites and marketing, that's super helpful. I'm wondering if you could help kind of frame what -- whether that you'll -- you'll give a subscriber number but anyway you think about what your WordPress customer base is? And then, and if I missed this, I apologize, because I have been dancing around calls but any changes to M&A views, now Aman with, with you on board, and I know you've talked about the leverage ratios and you add buybacks to the capital structure now. So just any way to -- any changes to the way to think about how you guys are thinking about M&A going forward. Thanks. Raymond Winborne : Hi, it's Ray, I'll take the first one, not going to disclose a specific subs on our Managed WordPress but we've been talking about growth in those subscriptions together in the 40% plus and it's still in that area. So, very happy with both the number of subscribers together but more importantly, the growth rate we're seeing at it. Amanpal Bhutani : And then just a bit of color on how I think about M&A. I tend to think of it in two parts. The first type of M&A is where the acquiring companies that look like us and GoDaddy has done a good job of that. That was how we added our European brands. And the past, there is really about the platform and the integration and the synergies that come with that. And the second way I think about M&A, is that the companies do something a bit different. They don't exactly look like you and they can be small, which are small tuck-ins and you've seen us do CoBlocks and SellBrite are great examples of that where they tend to be small and the integration effort also tends to be low. And then there are commercialized sort of medium size acquisitions that add new capability or key capability to the business and a good example of that is Main Street Hub. And the third, which we've done less of is where we add sort of at the corporate level completely new capability or category to the -- to the business where we start to serve new customer segments. And I feel that we have the ability to do all of these as a company and really I think all of this is just to say that I think the opportunities are ahead of us and probably, what makes sense for us to reiterate how we think about it where we think we want to invest in our organic business and we want to be able to do M&A and then do share buybacks and our order of priority there hasn't changed. Ygal Arounian : That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Jason Helfstein of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead, your line is open. Jason Helfstein : Thanks. So certainly I am going to dig certainly into the last question. So during the future of M&A as a company you will be more focused on existing or new product lines, just because it would seem like there aren't a lot of HEGs out there. And then, just another follow-up on the Verisign, does that change the economics of the domain portfolio that you hold and to the extent you're holding a domain, the price goes up, you said you pass them on, but just generally, does that change how you think about it or just having those domains are so important for the other parts of the business, any more color there. Thanks. Amanpal Bhutani : Yes, I think on the first part of your question around would we do one or the other. I would say we have the ability to do both. And I wouldn't constrain us to one or the other. And in terms of the change in the economics of our portfolio with Verisign, I'm not seeing a ton of stuff there in terms of a huge impact to us. Andrew Low Ah Kee : And I'd just add our own portfolio, the reason we have that, is it a way for us to remove friction and actually help build a secondary market in the namespace, which are names have real value. And right now that marketplace is really bespoke it happens many cases human to human but by virtue of having -- having the portfolio and helping drive that marketplace, we're able to introduce technology like our valuation algorithms and other things, which actually help people in that experience. Jason Helfstein : Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Aman Bhutani for closing remarks. Amanpal Bhutani : I just wanted to end by saying thank you to all of you for joining and thank you to the 9,000 plus GoDaddy employees all over the world that work every day for us to be better, and do a fantastic job. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, you may now disconnect.",

I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mark Grant, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead. Mark Grant : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Godaddy's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2019 Earnings Call. With me today are Aman Bhutani, Chief Executive Officer; and Ray Winborne, Chief Financial Officer. Aman and Ray will share some prepared remarks, and then we'll open up the call for your questions. On today's call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and operating metrics such as total bookings, unlevered free cash flow normalized EBITDA, net debt and ARPU. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents may be found in the presentation posted to our Investor Relations website at investors.godaddy.net or on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC with today's earnings release. The matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements, which include those related to our future financial results; new product introductions and innovations; our ability to integrate recent acquisitions and achieve desired synergies, and including our recent acquisition of Over and the expected acquisition of Uniregistry's domain registrar and marketplace businesses. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, February 13, 2020, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.  With that, here's Aman. Amanpal Bhutani : Thanks, Mark, and thank you, everyone, for joining our fourth quarter earnings call. 2019 closed out with strong operational execution and consistent financial performance, as we near $3 billion in revenue while growing unlevered free cash flow 19% year-over-year. Equally important, we are entering 2020 with confidence after having moved quickly against a set of objectives to realign how we operate as a company, including changes to our priorities, leadership and teams, all in passionate support of our mission to enable entrepreneurs with technology, humanity and purpose. We made these rapid changes to accelerate execution, all while delivering on our financial commitments across the board.  With five months into my tenure, I wanted to share a few thoughts on our core priorities of enabling a strong platform, creating an intuitive customer experience and continued brand expansion, including our recent launch of our new logo. First, our core platform goals remain unchanged : increasing our velocity of innovation, delighting our customers with robust and flexible products globally and seamlessly acquiring and integrating brands onto our platform. Many investors have asked me two critical questions. How much is it going to cost? And when will we see results?  Based on my experience of enabling platforms and the state of our platform in context of the resources in place today, I can say with confidence that we will achieve our platform goals with minimal incremental investment. In terms of results, we expect to deliver new capabilities every quarter. And I am happy to share that we recently launched the capability to simultaneously launch products across all GoDaddy brands globally, including our EMEA brands. It is live with a couple of brands today, and we plan to roll it out to all major brands over the next few months.  Turning to our second priority. We are staying focused on building seamlessly intuitive customer experiences. When we look at the entrepreneurial journey, there is a clear pattern of interconnected tasks that create friction for our customers, which leads to frustration and discouragement. We've been investing heavily behind a number of solutions for each of our customer audiences, namely in Websites + Marketing, WordPress and our naming capabilities. First, Websites + Marketing caters to our independent, do-it-yourself customers, where we've delivered increased simplicity in commerce and content creation. In commerce, we recently simplified our customers' ability to transact with their customers through new integrations, including Google Shopping and the Facebook developer platform where we're now powering service commerce bookings on both Instagram and Facebook. Each of those platforms is important to our customers and their engagement with their customers, and we've totally streamlined the management of these channels.  In content creation, we recently acquired Over, a company with a suite of user-friendly design tools to quickly create beautiful and professional digital content for every marketing channel. We will quickly integrate Over's capabilities into Websites + Marketing to help our customers seamlessly enrich their social, e-mail and website presence. And as an independent app, Over's 1 million monthly active users look remarkably like our everyday entrepreneurs with the average subscriber creating 23 pieces of content a month. With near-perfect ratings on the App stores and an NPS north of 80, it is a truly compelling experience. I highly encourage you to download the Over app and give a try.  Secondly, for our partners who create websites on behalf of others, we have been making significant investments in the open-source WordPress ecosystem. As you all know, WordPress is the world's largest CMS with a massive community of users. Our team has been rapidly innovating the WordPress editor to simplify the website building experience, and we recently launched our Go template. The Go template has become one of the most downloaded templates in the WordPress community, and it's based on our acquired technology from CoBlocks. This improved experience is being adopted by the entire WordPress community, not just our customers, and is cementing GoDaddy as the global champion of WordPress.  And lastly, for our large customers, we just announced the acquisition of several business components from Uniregistry. We've acquired a set of world-class tools, experiences and technology to help our customers and domain investors buy and manage domains, a broker network to add capability to our aftermarket business of corporate registrar as well as a portfolio of high-quality names that will help us improve liquidity in the secondary market. Stepping back, Websites + Marketing, Managed WordPress and our aftermarket are thriving on account of the seamlessly intuitive experiences we are enabling. We are seeing validation that building a website with GoDaddy is an exceptional experience, whether that be in third-party reviews, successful published rates, the billions of GME we're enabling or strength of our renewal cohorts. And most compelling, Websites + Marketing is taking market share within the captive website building industry, while Managed WordPress subscription sales have been hitting new record levels since our latest launch at the end of October. All are signs of a healthy franchise.  Moving on to brand. This time last year, we launched a bold evolution in our brand strategy, deploying investment into influencer-driven creative content and a slate of icons that embody the GoDaddy spirit. This has been a highly successful strategy, producing strong levels of brand sentiment, social buzz and impressions, all of which are well ahead of our competition. We celebrated this evolution last month as we launched our new logo, the Go. The Go captures our unique ability to enable, connect and champion, millions of people around the world who are making their own way as entrepreneurs, truly making opportunity accessible to all. The logo launch was incredibly successful, and we couldn't be prouder of our teams and the results. In closing, I want to say a quick word about my confidence in our ability to deliver. As Ray will touch on, we nailed 2019, right in line with the targets we set at the beginning of the year. Beneath the headline results, we underwent substantial change as we realigned our teams behind our core customer populations, furthering our identity as a customer-led software company.  In the midst of change, companies often take their foot off the gas but not at GoDaddy. I'm particularly proud that this team stood up, fiercely embraced change and refused to do anything short delivery what we committed to. That's unique, and that's what creates the durable business that is GoDaddy.  We're looking forward to sharing more about the changes we're making and our future at our April 2 Investor Day. With that, here's Ray. Raymond Winborne : Hey, thanks, Aman. I'll touch on our fourth quarter financial results and our outlook for 2020. As Aman highlighted, 2019 was another solid performance as our teams delivered terrific outcomes across the business. From a financial perspective, full year results landed right on top of our initial guidance, with revenue up 12% year-over-year and unlevered free cash flow, up 19%, delivering over 1 point of margin expansion.  We also returned significant capital to shareholders and strengthened our balance sheet, leaving us well positioned to drive growth in 2020. Turning to the fourth quarter results. Bookings grew to $834 million, rising 14% year-over-year on a reported and constant currency basis as currency headwinds subsided. Growth was broad-based with strength across product categories and included a reacceleration of growth in international bookings.  Revenue came in at $780 million, growing 12% year-over-year or about 13% on a constant currency basis. We're seeing good growth across each of the revenue categories, with particular strength in Websites + Marketing subscriptions and continued momentum in aftermarket sales. The key metrics underlying growth have remained consistently strong. ARPU rose to $158, up 7% year-over-year, while we added 757,000 customers in 2019, in line with what we've shared previously. Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter was $178 million, growing 40% year-over-year, reflecting good operating leverage in the P&L and an easy compare, created by the timing of CapEx spend in Q3 and Q4 last year.  On the balance sheet, we finished the year with $1.1 billion in cash and short-term investments, and net debt landed at $1.3 billion, putting net leverage near the low end of our targeted range of 2 to 4x on a trailing 12-month basis. Moving on to our outlook for 2020. We expect to deliver revenue of approximately $3.3 billion, representing growth of 11% versus 2019. We're starting the year on pace and expect to deliver revenue of $795 million for the first quarter of 2020. We will continue to drive margin expansion in 2020. We expect $835 million in unlevered free cash flow, which includes a highly anomalous extra pay period that won't occur again for over a decade. Absent this payment, unlevered free cash flow growth would be 16% year-over-year. The extra pay period doesn't impact the P&L, and therefore, you should expect mid-teens growth in normalized EBITDA as we deliver operating leverage. Stepping back, we're well positioned to deliver another year of exceptional outcomes in 2020 by leveraging our competitive advantages, investments we're making to increase customer value and continued optimization of our platform. And as you can see in our financial guide, we're doing that in a disciplined fashion, delivering both top line growth and margin expansion. We look forward to sharing more details on our growth plans as well as a financial framework with you at our Investor Day on April 2.  Thanks, everyone, for joining today. And with that, operator, let's open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The first question comes from Deepak Mathivanan of Barclays. Mario Lu : This is Mario Lu on for Deepak. Can you elaborate on the free cash flow guide? How should we think about the nature of investment that's reflected in your guidance? Are those ongoing or onetime in nature? Raymond Winborne : Sure. I'll start and see if Aman wants to [indiscernible] over the top. But the guide we put out there at 16% ex special item on the pay period, it reflects all the investment we're putting into the platform that Aman spoke about on the call as well as in the marketing, care, and we'll get leverage on our G&A line item. So it reflects everything that we've got line of sight into. And if you look at our history, we will tell you what we're going to do, and then we're going to go do it. Amanpal Bhutani : Now I'll just say that we've not -- I've now had more time to look at our investments for the year. And as we said, we're covering everything we know in it. So you should take it just as it is. Operator : Your next question comes from Matt Pfau of William Blair. Matthew Pfau : Aman, I wanted to ask on some of the reallocated resource and maybe a little bit of incremental investment. Is that primarily going to the areas you mentioned in terms of Websites + Marketing, WordPress and some of the other naming, branding type tools? Or are there other areas as well? And then any areas that previously where we're invested in that you're pulling some of those resources from that plan to be less of a focus going forward? Amanpal Bhutani : Yes. Thanks for the question, Matt. Just to clarify, the incremental investments we're making are small so I would really look at the reallocation, which was the second part of your question. And yes, our investments are focused in the core products. We also are moving a bit of more investment into our core platform, which is going to allow our products to move faster. And that's one of the key reallocations. When a product suite is more separate, you may have to make certain duplicate investments for certain capabilities, then we're pulling some of those back down at the company level to just create the best customer experience that we can. Operator : Your next question comes from Sterling Auty of JPMorgan. Jackson Ader : This is Jackson Ader on for Sterling tonight. Can you just give us a little bit of insight into the expectations for customer additions that are baked into this 2020 guidance on the top line? Raymond Winborne : Hey, sure. It's Ray. You guys know, we haven't historically guided to customer count. We only called out the impact of the merchandising tactics last year because it was an anomaly. We've mentioned this numerous times, we don't run the business on customer count, and so we're not going to guide to a number. That said, if you look at our go-to-market motion, it's working, as evidenced by the top line growth that we delivered as well as the guide we've got in front of us. Andrew Low Ah Kee : And hey, Jackson, it's Andrew Low Ah Kee here. I'd just add, our 2019 customer cohort was the highest value we've ever acquired. The growth and the progress you're seeing in Websites + Marketing and WordPress is showing up in that value, and in Aman's comment during the call earlier that we're taking market share. Jackson Ader : Okay. That's helpful. Then a quick follow-up, if we can just stick with the Websites + Marketing, the subscribers that you're adding, what does the attach rate look like, if you can give us any kind of quantitative detail there? And if not, maybe how has it -- how does it compare to maybe some attach rates of other products in the past? Amanpal Bhutani : Yes. We don't talk about the specifics of the attach rate. But I would tell you that, broadly, it has met and exceeded our expectations, and it's higher than what we've seen in the past and with other products. And the best example of that is if you look at Websites + Marketing, a product that we sort of built from the ground up and really gone into market over the last 2.5 years or so, has gotten rapid adoption, right? We see the growth in the product, which is significantly a function of how well we are able to attach to people coming into the site or coming into care for us. Operator : Your next question comes from Nick Jones of Citi. Nicholas Jones : You mentioned there's some interconnected tasks that lead to friction for your customers. Can you maybe elaborate on that and a little bit? And how does that inform on kind of the product development pipeline? Amanpal Bhutani : Yes. Let me share with you a journey that we see very often. Everyday entrepreneur has an idea they want to take online, and they start with a name and they come in and -- come in to our site and looking for a domain name, and that's fantastic. They can find the name. If the name is available, we can give it -- we can sell it to them. If it's not available, we actually have broker services that can help them. But the minute you get past that name, somebody may be thinking about, \"Oh, I want to create a little image logo. I want to be able to just send this out to my friends and say, 'here's what my idea looks like.'\" And immediately, you have the need to create online content, right? And if that experience is not intuitive in terms of, if at that moment, you can't offer that service, then there's a break and friction in the process for the entrepreneur to continue.  And we basically have mapped out this journey, sort of in a pretty detailed level. And now we're looking at gaps in that journey and saying, \"You know what, here is the moment where somebody has to create a digital asset as an example. Well, let's look in the marketplace, who's got amazing products that do that.\" And that leads us to something like Over where we see a great group of people building an amazing product and a need that our customer has. And then when we plug that in, we say, \"Okay, now let's look at the next one and so on.\" Does that help? Nicholas Jones : That does. So if we look at kind of some of the products that come out, there's things in e-commerce, things in driving traffic, some things in design. Is there one category that's kind of most exciting? It sounds like maybe the design part and the content generation. Amanpal Bhutani : I think content creation is a big category. Commerce is a big category. Category we're putting more energy into is messaging. So our customers engaging their customers is a really big category. And it's really complicated for our customers that tend to be micro businesses to handle just all the channels that they have to handle because customers are coming in and talking to businesses in new ways. And our -- the entrepreneur needs to be able to answer those requests. So bringing those channels together, making it simple, is another good category for us. Operator : Your next question is from Brent Thill of Jefferies. Brent Thill : Aman, if you could just double click into the platform goal with minimal new investments, many are watching that line and believe there's a lot of interesting things you could do there and manage -- managing the other part of the stack. Can you just walk through directionally at the high level, how do you think you can manage that without having to put more capital into the business? . Amanpal Bhutani : Yes. So as I discussed last time, this was an area of investigation for me to understand deeply. Just given my background, I wanted to really understand it. And a couple of things pop up. The first is, if you look at the last 2 years, there has been significant investment in the tech and dev line, and the company has been focused on improving. The second -- so that -- there's already a set of investment there for me to use. The second is that given my background, the one big thing I can bring to the table is that, like many other companies, sort of investing in their platforms, a company will -- on point A will want to go to point B and say, \"Okay, we should make these investments.\" Well, I've been through that cycle and realize that you get to point B and then often have to go to point C from there. And that's where I can bring my expertise and say, \"Hey, guys, I know we're on this path. I know it makes sense. But I know what it looks like when we get there. So let's just chart the path from the A to C directly.\"  And I had alluded to this last time in the call, too, but it's not a matter of putting armies of people behind this thing. It's about finding the right people with the right skill set and get them focused on a small number of priorities. So that was the plan that we wanted to put in place. And now I'm very confident that, that's the best plan record. Brent Thill : Okay. Great. Just real quick for Ray. Hosting and Presence growing slower than Domains. I think vendor asking, is there a catch-up that can come? Is there something you can do there, if they're buying the domain from you, why wouldn't that line grow a little faster? Raymond Winborne : No. Thanks, Brent. We've been really happy with the growth we've seen in there. Obviously, the Websites + Marketing and Managed WordPress are the software subscriptions we're leaning into. Those are growing around 40% on a unit basis. So growth is there. It's just living in a large line item, right? This is a $1.1 billion line, very difficult to inflect that and -- but we're very happy with the success we're seeing in the subscription growth. Operator : Your next question comes from Ygal Arounian of Wedbush Securities. Ygal Arounian : I may have missed this in the disclosure, but the guidance, does it include the acquisitions? And any way to think about what the contribution is on -- I'm guessing Uniregistry would be a bit more of a contributor? And then on that topic of Uniregistry, just maybe walk us through a little bit more the rationale of the acquisition, what the gaps in your offerings that you think it's complementing or things that it's building on a little bit better and how just it overall fits with the portfolio. And if you could tell us the domains under management and how that contributes to your overall domains. Raymond Winborne : Yes. Hey, it's Ray. I'll start with the impact on guidance and then toss it to Aman. On the top line, the combined impact of both of those acquisitions over in Uniregistry are about 1 point, and the impact to unlevered free cash flow is negligible. Amanpal Bhutani : Yes. And in terms of the components of Uniregistry, the key pieces that are for the GoDaddy business now include a set of tools and experiences for our large customers. Second, there's a set of -- sorry, there is a portfolio of names that is part of Uniregistry that is coming into the company as well.  So if I just take those two items separately. When we look at our large customers, there is a set of friction for them to be able to do their jobs. It's -- there's a lot of off-line stuff. There's a lot of sort of handholding and interaction in the broker service. And Uniregistry is built from the ground up tools and experiences for that cost. So bringing those back into the GoDaddy family and offering it to all of our large customers is a fantastic addition.  In terms of the portfolio, it's about 350,000 domains. It's a fantastic portfolio. It allows us to continue to improve the liquidity of our secondary market and really offer those names up to all the people coming into GoDaddy.com and searching for a domain name. Ygal Arounian : If I could ask one quick follow-up on WordPress and the Go theme plug-in, is that something you guys monetize? And how should we think about how that fits in with the rest of the Managed WordPress portfolio? Amanpal Bhutani : Yes. So the Go theme is really about our position in the open-source community. It's about the broader, the set of brand building for us as a company. We don't monetize the theme. People can use the Go theme whether they are a customer of ours, for example, on Managed WordPress or if they're just using WordPress anywhere in the world with anybody else, right? This dramatic -- the team is really focused on dramatically reducing the time designers need to put something together that's beautiful and do it really fast. I would encourage anyone to just go out and try it. If you go out and try it, you'll see the difference in how you yourself can create a site that looks gorgeous and happens quickly. Operator : Your next question comes from Naved Khan of SunTrust. Naved Khan : Yes. Maybe a couple of questions. So if we have to think about segment level growth, maybe, Ray, you can give us some pointers like, I think, previously, you kind of spoke about like Domains growing maybe slightly faster than unit and Hosting and Presence growing maybe 2 to 3x and then apps growing faster? And how should we think about that for 2020? That will be very helpful, if you can. And then just on the conversational marketing. Obviously, you guys ramped up the spend through 2018 and '19, how should we think about that growing as a part of the mix in 2020? Raymond Winborne : Hey, it's Ray, Naved. I'll start with the first piece of that, and then I'll toss it to Andrew. I'm not going to provide specific guidance on a line item. But I think a decent way to think about 2020 in the overall context of our 11% would be Domains in the high single digits. We're going to lap some pretty strong growth out of aftermarket in 2019. Hosting and Presence in the high single digits, and that's going to be driven primarily by continued growth in Websites + Marketing as well as our Managed WordPress offerings. And in biz apps, which is now over $500 million line item, growing in the high teens. We'll share more with you guys, more insight into the growth algorithm, how we're thinking about the market opportunity for us at our Investor Day in early April. Andrew Low Ah Kee : And Naved, it's Andrew here. On conversational marketing on the full year in '19, we obviously scaled up our spend and delevered that line a little bit, which is a good thing. While we've scaled that up, importantly conversational marketing and the pace of testing, iteration of campaigns has really improved and increased. And we're seeing those gains and improvements kind of driving new and expanding reach into our existing customer base paying off, and we're seeing good strength in bookings as a result. Op is good. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call over to Aman Bhutani, the CEO, for closing remarks. Amanpal Bhutani : Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us for our call. And I'll just give a shout out to all GoDaddy employees all over the world, doing great work. Thank you very much. We'll talk to you in the quarter. Bye. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Mark Grant, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir. Mark Grant : Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Godaddy's first quarter 2020. With me today are Aman Bhutani, Chief Executive Officer; and Ray Winborne, Chief Financial Officer. Aman and Ray will share some prepared remarks, and then we'll open up the call for your questions. On today's call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and operating metrics such as total bookings, un-levered free cash flow, normalized EBITDA and net debt. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents maybe found in the presentation posted to our Investor Relations website at investors.godaddy.net or on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC with today's earnings release. The matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements, which include those related to our future financial results; new product introductions and innovations; our ability to integrate recent acquisitions and proposed acquisitions and achieve desired synergies, including our recent acquisition of Over, our recent acquisition Uniregistry's domain registrar and marketplace businesses and the expected acquisition of Neustar's registry business and the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on our business, customers and employees. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, May 6, 2020, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events unless required by law. With that, here's Aman. Aman Bhutani : Thank you for joining us today and thanks again to those who joined us for our Investor Day in April. While it has only been one month since we spoke to you, we have several important updates to share today. Plus, in Q1, we delivered strong financial results which included the early impact of COVID-19 as expected changes in consumer behavior rippled across the globe along the COVID-19 arc, with the last two weeks in March being the toughest in the U.S. as everyone focused on safety first. Second, there are definitive proof points that we are creating significant value for our customers. We are seeing an uptick in customer demand as new customers are exploring how to build the website and everyday entrepreneurs in fashion, beauty, health, professional services and many other verticals are forging ahead with new ideas. Those with the website are expanding the online scope of existing ventures, adding commerce and payment features, creating digital content and downloads, adding virtual classes, appointment scheduling and much more. Third, I'm excited to share more on OpenWeStand. What started as an idea about a month ago has become a movement with over 50 partners and over 50 million views on YouTube. It is a testament of the extraordinary power of our community and the distinctive powerful and differentiated reach of our brand. The true heroes in this movement are the everyday entrepreneurs who are finding a virtual way to be open even when their physical doors are closed, making OpenWeStand a reality. And fourth, as we look into Q2, our core business continues to be resilient, with renewal rates edging up year-over-year. Predicting the balance of the pressure on small and medium sized businesses on one hand and human creativity driving new digital demand on the other is pretty hard. For example, in Germany and Italy, where the pandemic seems to have been restrained, we have seen growth customer adds accelerate to 80% year-over-year growth, albeit of a relatively smaller base. Additionally, while we have some headwind in care and services and through disciplined execution we have improved them on a weekly basis for some teams being back in the office environment remains a key part of getting back to peak performance. In his comments Ray will go through what all of this means for Q2 guidance. Let's dig into creating value for everyday entrepreneurs. GoDaddy is a customer-led software company, built on the foundational idea that creating value for our customers is the best way to create value for our shareholders. Helping our customers on the journey from green to create and grow remains a key driver of engagement and TAM expansion. As customer needs shifted over the past few weeks, accelerating our pace of experimentation and innovation enabled us to quickly bring offers to support them. Over the last four weeks, we have started an experiment with a freemium model for websites plus marketing. This is now available to all customers in the U.S. and include product integration with GoFundMe, robust gift card functionality, expanded capabilities with PayPal and much more. In the true spirit of experimentation being customer-led, we also launched a basic messaging capability so our customers are able to connect with their customers. Getting these features out quickly allows us to give early customer feedback and improve them rapidly. For example, you will see us upgrade the messaging capability within days, and that is just one of the two ecosystems we are part of. We also have a new offer available to designers and developers, bringing together manage WordPress and WooCommerce at an attractive limited time price point of $1 for three months, everything they need to get their customers selling online fast. In fact, it's not just websites plus marketing or manage WordPress that we're moving on quickly to improve all our products and engineering teams have reset their roadmaps on the WIN model, meaning what's important now. We have active offers for three-month free trial of our digital marketing suite and overthrow and 30-day free trials of celebrates multiplatform e-commerce marketplace solution. And the results install of the over app jumped 24% month-over-month in March and Sellbrite saw a 20% month-over-month increase in connections to online marketplaces. The opportunity to introduce our products to customers when they need them most in a manner that is easy for them create immediate customer value and will lead to shareholder value over time. And we want to extend our ability to experiment to innovate and give customers more choices at competitive price points. One of the key tools in our toolbox is the ability to deploy capital, and in early April, we announced the acquisition of the registry business from Neustar, which will be known as GoDaddy Registry. While the acquisition will have only a small financial impact this year, we believe there is significant strategic importance here. We have demonstrated in our roughly 20 years as a registrar that we can innovate and dramatically increase the value we offer to customers. We plan to bring the same innovative rigor to the registry business. Vertical integration reduces the many complexities of building innovative end-to-end offerings for customers at competitive price points. We have experience creating value for everyone in the industry. Just look at the domain aftermarket. Over the nearly seven years since Afternic became part of GoDaddy, almost every major registrar leverages our Afternic platform for aftermarket domain sales, creating greater choice and value for customers and creating greater value for our partners. We look forward to closing the acquisition in the coming months, and welcoming the team to the GoDaddy family. Equally important is the guidance we provide to our customers which has been part of our ethos at GoDaddy since the beginning. It is our killer app. It is a competitive advantage. In these unprecedented times, entrepreneurs need guidance and we are committed to being there for them.  When we took 7,500 Guides home several weeks ago, we focused first on their safety and then moved quickly and creatively to guide customers effectively. And I am happy to share that our average speed answer has been exceptional. Customers are surprised and delighted that we would call them just to offer help, and they have shared positive recognition for our guide across many calls. Anecdotally, I have received a greater number of messages directly from customers, thanking us for being there to help them in this difficult period. This is why we exist. This is what our brand is about. The GoDaddy brand is a remarkable asset, and there has never been a better expression of it than OpenWeStand. Let me take a moment to share its origin. About a month ago, we saw a gap in the way small businesses could find and take advantage of the many offers available to them. The offers were not in a central location that made it easy for entrepreneurs to find them. OpenWeStand solve both these problems and has grown beyond our wildest expectations, in an amazing display of the exponential power of our community what I thought would be 2020 hindsight has become 50/50. I thought 20 partners and 20 million views would have been an amazing achievement. But here we are more than 50 partners and over 50 million views on YouTube and thousands of activations by small business owners. That is a movement and the momentum continues. The movement started with a 60-second film to communicate our desire to help businesses stay open, even when their doors are closed. We invest in media to communicate this message and directed all traffic to OpenWeStand.org. This site now stands as a repository for us and our partners to provide offers, help and advice, where partners can edit their own content and small business owners can find the help they need. As traffic to the site continues to grow, we are posting more offers and content, as well as enhancing filtering capabilities making it easier to navigate. The need for these resources is great. As an example we did our first webinar last week with expectations of 300 attendees. It tremendously exceeded our expectations with 5,000 sign-up and over 1,000 attendees. It has been humbling and inspiring to see the response from the community, and we will continue to put muscle and marketing dollars behind OpenWeStand, providing valuable offers to our community in a central location. Before I wrap up, I want to tell you about Liv, one of our remarkable everyday entrepreneurs. She started Box and Flow in New York of boxing and yoga studio. If you talk to her, she will tell you that she really believes in this idea of balance and combining strength and softness as a way of life. When the pandemic hit, she left her studio in New York and temporarily moved to Florida to be near family. But the entrepreneurial spirit in her didn't stop. She was comfortable taking risks, though she continued to try and experiment. She started teaching classes on Instagram and last week offered all her classes online. She is not only teaching her regulars in New York, she now has regulars from Malaysia to Barcelona. Liv is not just trying to survive. She figured out how to make her dream bigger, and she demonstrates the spirit and drive we are here to serve. And in these times where so many parts of our lives have transitioned to a digital experience, we are seeing the best of human creativity. We believe human creativity will drive many variations of online businesses, and we are fortunate to be a global leader serving this massive market of everyday entrepreneurs like Liv. In the current COVID driven climate, GoDaddy's distinctive financial profile with profitable growth at scale stands out. We have the capability to invest capital aggressively and an experienced management team that can make sure we do that with prudence and as good stewards of both the P&L and the balance sheet. We know that short-term everyday entrepreneurs like Liv may have some setbacks, but we know that their beliefs and spirit will not be deterred. I believe in Liv and millions of other everyday entrepreneurs just like her keeps us confident that we will deliver on our 411 target, $4 billion in revenue and $1.1 billion un-levered free cash flow organically by 2020.  With that, here is Ray. Ray Winborne : Thanks, Aman. I'll touch on the financial results for the quarter and the outlook for Q2, along with some additional commentary on the impacts of COVID-19 to our business, and finally, the contribution we expect from Neustar's registry. Q1 reflected good top line performance and strong operating leverage in the business. Despite some softness in the last few weeks of the quarter, initial impacts of shelter-in-place began to materialize. Revenue came in at $792 million, growing over 12% on a constant currency basis, with 80 basis points of currency. Looking at product categories, we delivered double-digit growth in domains on higher average selling price. Growth in hosting and presence accelerated, higher subscriptions to Websites + Marketing and our managed WordPress offering. And while business applications grew 14% year-over-year, growth rate was reduced by roughly 4% point due to the cancellation of CloudFest, our annual hosting industry conference response to COVID-19. By geography the U.S. grew 14% versus last year. Our international revenue was $260 million in Q1, growing 9% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. The international revenue growth rate was reduced by approximately two percentage points due to the cancellation of CloudFest.  Total bookings grew to $951 million, rising 10% on a constant currency basis with an estimated two points of pressure from the effects of COVID-19, roughly a point of currency headwind. The US dollar has continued to strengthen against the basket of currencies we collect, and we expect currency to remain a headwind in Q2. Gross margin was 65% in the quarter in line with the trailing 12-month average. We delivered solid operating leverage this quarter, particularly in the care and G&A line items, as we continue to scale the business. This resulted in normalized EBITDA of $164 million in Q1, a three points of margin expansion last year. Moving to cash flow. Un-levered free cash flow for the quarter was $235 million, growing 18% year-over-year. This quarter benefited from the timing of CapEx payment. We expect to balance out in the first half of 2020. Trailing 12-month un-levered free cash flow was over three quarters of a billion dollars and margin top 25%, illustrating the size and scale of this business. On the balance sheet, we finished Q1 with $851 million in cash and total liquidity of nearly $1.5 billion. Net debt landed at $1.6 billion or about two-times net leverage on a trailing 12-month basis. And we have no significant debt maturities until 2024. This affords us both a margin of safety in uncertain times, but also the opportunity to invest both organically and inorganically. Since our last earnings call, we deployed over $0.5 billion in capital, repurchasing 10 million shares of our common stock an average price of just over $54 per share. Very attractive valuation from a forward free cash flow year. This repurchase represents nearly 6% of our fully diluted shares outstanding. We also announced the acquisition of Neustar's registry business, with the purchase price of $218 million, with closing expected in the coming months. We will fund the acquisition from cash on the balance sheet. And based on the information obtained in diligence, we estimate the 2020 financial contribution will be less than a point to revenue growth and less than $10 million to un-levered free cash flow. Stepping back, GoDaddy has a recurring revenue business model, is highly cash generative as well capitalized with a strong liquidity position, providing the ability to both weather storms and take advantage of opportunity. Against this backdrop, you'll continue to see us be thoughtful stewards of capital, with the ultimate goal of prudently driving attractive growth un-levered free cash flow for [technical difficulty]. With that, let's turn to the outlook for Q2. Including the estimated $25 million to $30 million impact of COVID-19 that we outlined at Investor Day, we expect total revenue of approximately $790 million or 7% year-over-year growth. We expect total bookings growth to be roughly in line with revenue growth for the quarter. We will continue to provide quarterly updates to guidance as we navigate our way through the current environment. To reiterate what we called out last month, these are unprecedented time, but the degree of uncertainty facing our customers, peers and communities in general, we want to make sure we continue to provide the pattern of transparency we've established. We don't have a crystal ball and while we're seeing resiliency in subscription renewals and strength in new online sales, we have experienced some headwinds in two areas of the business. First, and certain of our higher price do-it-for-you services aftermarket, seeing the natural effect of price consciousness the businesses exhibit in uncertain times. And second, work from home has had a predictable impact on new sales predicted of our Care Guides. While it's improving, we expect that to impact to continue to some degree until we get folks back in the office, whenever it's safe and prudent. As promised, we'll provide a bit more granularity around our quarterly revenue guidance going forward. Q2, we would expect high single digit growth in domains, mid single digit growth in hosting and presence and mid-teens growth in business application. Do-it-for-you services like social reputation management and professional website build disproportionately impact the hosting and presence line. Finally, while COVID-19 has created a significant upheaval in the global economy and job markets, it has led to an uptick in interest to start new venture. You should expect us to lean in on marketing spend, attractive customer offers drive share that increased demand. In closing, we have a distinctive value proposition that combines our brand, seamlessly intuitive experiences, power of community and sage guidance, uniquely serve our customers, help them continue their business while minimizing complaints, huge opportunity in serving the needs of the everyday entrepreneur. And we're proud to deliver on the promise of partnership that our customers in these challenging times. With that operator, let's open up the call for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Yigal Iranian from Wedbush. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Yigal Iranian : Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Two, if I could. So, let's see here a little bit more about the Neustar Registry acquisition, the strategic importance of that, how verticalization helps that segment over time, especially given that there's some sensitivities around favoring GoDaddy products. So, that's the first one. And then maybe if you could give both on the revenue impacts from the free trials and the freemium website offer that you're giving customers, if you could help quantify the impact there? And then also if you could help quantify the impact of bringing new customers onboard and keeping the retention rate up, how those free trials are impacting growth. Thanks. Aman Bhutani : Hey, Yigal. It\u2019s Aman. Thank you for your question. Unfortunately, the tech issue and we didn't catch the first part of your question, only the second part. Would you mind just repeating the question for us. Yigal Iranian : Sure. So, the first part was just on the Neustar Registry acquisition. If you could help, maybe give a little bit more color around the strategic importance of it. Why verticalization is important. How that could help the domain business grow over time, especially given that there's some sensitivities around not favoring GoDaddy products when you're in the funnel for that. That was the first question.. Aman Bhutani : Yeah. Thank you. Let me take the first piece of that and Andrew can talk to the governance pieces and sort of creating opportunity across the industry. If we take a step back and look at the dream phase for the customer, we've continued to be a leader in that space, with our domains product and we've been in many parts of the domain business. We mentioned the aftermarket as an example of something recent that we did that went across the industry. But if you look at the registry business, that's the business we have not been in the past. And if you think about creating just new different kinds of offering -- this very innovative different ways to think about domains as competitive price points to go across organizations involves a certain level of risk and just challenges to coordinate all of that. With vertical integration, we can experiment at a much faster pace. We can sort of wave all of those things and say we want to test this, let's get this in front of customers and let's see how it works. And while we do that, we can do it in a manner where it's open to the whole industry where the line of governance is clear. And just like the aftermarket value is created not just for the customer, but for everyone in the industry that participates as well. And Andrew, do you want to add a bit to it. Andrew Low Ah Kee : I think to Aman's point this idea that we innovate and we bring value across the entire industry is something we've got a track record with today in our aftermarket business on our Afternic platform. We actually partner with virtually every major registrar in the industry and that's created a ton of value for all of the participants, and we look forward to doing the same with our registry business. We do have a clear governance model in place that create separation between these businesses to address concerns folks might have, and we're confident in our ability to implement that. There are a number of vertically integrated registrar registries in the industry today. They're able to stand by that commitment to offer equal access to everyone and we feel very comfortable with our ability to do it as well. Aman Bhutani : And then on the question on premium, it's pretty recent. We moved quickly to put it out there. It started as an experiment. We did roll it out to all customers in the U.S., but it's still very, very early and we designed it as an experiment. So, we're tracking a lot of data around it. And over the next few months, we'll be able to tell you a lot more about it. But it's still pretty early, yeah. Yigal Iranian : Thank you. Thanks so much Aman Bhutani : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan of Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open Unidentified Analyst : Hey, this is Thomas on for Deepak. With the free cash flow guidance withdrawn, can you help us with how we should think about the underlying variables here? Are there any changes in the contract term or product mix during this time that we -- that might weigh on free cash flow? Thank you. Ray Winborne : Yeah, Thomas. Hey, it's Ray. The bookings growth, I think, is where you should look. I mentioned in my prepared comments that we expected to grow roughly in line with revenue. Bookings translates to cash. And then the other thing that I pointed out is that we had timing impacts of capital payments from Q1 to Q2, so be looking at. But stepping back more broadly when you look at what's going on, Aman has talked about before, we're looking at the financial certainty for our employees, we're putting out attractive offers for our customers. So, those are going to pressure cash flow, but obviously there are a lot of discretionary expenses that we're managing very tightly to mitigate the impact of that. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Mark Zgutowicz of Rosenblatt Securities. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Mark Zgutowicz : Thanks much. Just curious on the customer acquisition front, you are thinking about LTV here and going. I guess, pressing the pedal down a bit as you mentioned. Just curious how you think about returns longer term, I assume most of who you're acquiring today are either out of work or potentially furloughed for a period of time. So, I'm just curious how you're considering that and when you look at potentially converging here down the road. Thanks. Andrew Low Ah Kee : Hey, Mark, it\u2019s Andrew Low Ah Kee here. I'm happy to talk to that one. We're definitely seeing an increase digitization of small business, the everyday entrepreneurs who maybe weren't online, didn't have a presence or even had one and needed to get it refreshed in an environment where everyone is finding and discovering things online is absolutely a tailwind for the sector at large. And so we are leaning in with our marketing spend. Aman in his prepared remarks referenced OpenWeStand. That's an important thing for our customers. It's an important thing for our brand. And equally, it has the same return profile that we typically would be looking at. In fact, when we look at our April cohort, our April cohort is the strongest we've ever had for in April. And so, we're absolutely seeing that demand come to bear in the marketplace. Mark Zgutowicz : Okay. Thanks much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brent Thill of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open thanks. Brent Thill : Thanks. On business apps, it was a little light of where the Street was modeling and some of the explainable late in the quarter. But I'm just curious if you saw that rebounding in April and into May, that the move to doing more with you than just buying one piece of the solution? Ray Winborne : Hey, Brent. It\u2019s Ray. There was one item that really drove a lot of that desale that you saw in the biz apps line and that's our CloudFest event. It's an annual event for the hosting industry and that created four point headwind on the growth rate there. Beyond that biz apps actually landed exactly where we had guided to earlier and right within our expectations. Brent Thill : And Ray, any color April through May listen to a number of these earnings calls you saw stabilization and improvement, are you seeing that follow-through through April into May. Ray Winborne : Yeah, I think, Aman highlighted a lot of what we're seeing in his prepared comments. We are seeing green shoots. I mean, if you look at -- renewal rates are absolutely holding steady. We're seeing good growth in new online sales. It's the couple of areas we pointed out before at the Investor Day where we're still seeing challenges and watching. One was around our Care Guides being at home and productivity sales hit. And then our higher price point products, which are generally the do-it-for-you products. Brent Thill : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney of RBC. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thanks. I'm sorry I'm going to ask a question, I may have missed some of the first part of the call. One of those issues that you just mentioned, Ray, that Care Guides efficiency. Did you -- did you already say whether you've seen some recovery in that? I understand the efficiencies that it's created from kind of taking people away from the -- whatever the synergies of a centralized place. Is it clear to you that there's a path back, or is that just going to be the case until people are able to get back in work in their shared centers. Ray Winborne : Yeah. Hey, Mark. Thanks for the question. And obviously, when we first went home, that was the greatest impact. While they were adjusting to the new environment, we really did see a pretty significant drop. We've been seeing continual improvement since then in the productivity, but there is a gap, right? These guys have been working out of offices in high energy sales environments for most of their careers and we're not going to get to that level of productivity, be working from home with those groups. So, I think, as far as where we are today and early May, we've seen a pretty significant improvement in the productivity of those Guides. Probably seeing what we're going to see until we're going to back in the office at this point. Mark Mahaney : Could you just remind us please where are those basic customer care centers, where are they located geographically? And in those areas what are the -- what's there -- what's the visibility and to when offices will be reopened? Ray Winborne : We're watching the local regulations and health announcements around the world. The vast majority of our Guides or a large majority of our Guides are based in Arizona and Iowa. But beyond that India is probably the next biggest that we've got. So we're watching each one of those locations will be treated differently based on the local conditions. Aman Bhutani : And Mark, this is Aman. We're actually in touch with local offices on a daily basis to see how the situation is developing for that city for the area around our office. And we're listening to politicians, we're listening to scientists. We also have our own criteria of one when we can take people back and we'll take a prudent approach to that. And we'll put some people in and experiment and have the proper office distancing and sort of make our way back as things improve. Mark Mahaney : And I'm sorry if I could throw in one other question. Andrew, you'd mentioned something about the big -- the April being a very strong month in terms of new customer acquisitions. I think, this is one of those hard questions to answer, because there's so early on. But can you tell whether that cohort -- April cohort, I know it's very early -- very recent. Is acting any different than cohorts you brought in, in the past. More engaged less engaged, any way to tell? Andrew Low Ah Kee : It's early to be talking about that. The reality is we're seeing very strong demand for our presence products. We shared with folks obviously the strength that we're seeing in the create space whether Websites + Marketing or WordPress with you all at Investor Day and those are areas we're seeing continued goodness in, in April, but it's early. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Naved Khan of SunTrust. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Nate Mitchell : Thanks. This is that Nate Mitchell on for Naved. Aman, thank you for the color on Germany. One, I was wondering if you could maybe speak to the growth in customer adds across geos in April. And then two, wondering if you can help us -- how to think about -- how big of an on-ramp the freemium offering and Website + Marketing can be for you guys. Thanks. Aman Bhutani : Yeah, thank you Nate for the question. We wanted to give you a little bit of color, so we took two markets in Italy and Germany and it's obviously hard for us to comment on each market and growth rates there. But as I said in my prepared remarks, there's an arc of COVID-19 and how it sort of progressed across the world where you saw every market sort of going to some level of lockdown and then sort of open up a little bit. And what we saw with that when there was unknown, right, people seem to clamp down and really worry about a lot of things and focus on safety. And in the U.S. that period seemed to be the last two weeks of March more so than other periods. But that same arc has sort of pretty much repeated itself across the world. And in terms of the on-ramp for freemium, it's just too early to be talking about it. We're super excited to have freemium there. We're super excited that we were able to bring it forward at a time when our customers needed most. But it's just too early to talk about -- just yet. Nate Mitchell : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Lloyd Walmsley of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Lloyd Walmsley : Thanks. Just wanted to ask about M&A and wondering if you're seeing anything in the current environment, maybe that starts to look more interesting, particularly given the use of leverage in the space privately. And then, I guess, related to that, is the current environment change at all? How you guys think about leverage and what you'd be willing or possible to take on as part of any M&A. Thanks. Aman Bhutani : Now let me take \u2026 Ray Winborne : Hey, Lloyd. It\u2019s Ray. I'll start and Aman can come over to talk. You look at our leverage today, we've got a target range of two to four times. We're right at the bottom of that range today, so feel comfortable. Obviously, given the uncertainty of COVID and how long it's going to go on, what the depth is going to be, we're obviously focused on liquidity like others. And we'll provide any specific comments around the pipeline on M&A right now. Aman Bhutani : Yeah, I think, Ray covered. You've seen us have been quite active over the last few months. And we have a pipeline, as we've said previously and we don't comment on any specific company which may or may not be part of our pipeline. Lloyd Walmsley : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Zgutowicz of Rosenblatt Securities. Please go ahead your line is open. Mark Zgutowicz : Thanks. I just had a follow-up on the Guides productivity question. I guess, the flip side of that question, when they are back in office, what do you expect to see in terms of lift and where would we see that? And then separate question on WooCommerce. Just curious what your long-term -- your near-term, long-term objectives are there. And so what we should expect for future, I guess, discussion on progress there. Thanks. Andrew Low Ah Kee : Sure. As both come back in the office, it's going to be a ramp as we get people back into the game. It is not like overnight. We're going to flip a switch and 7,300 Guides are going to be sitting back in the office. So, it's going to be a slow and long ramp as we get folks back into the office. And then in terms of how they perform, we think there will be an improvement. Again, as Ray mentioned, folks have built up a system over many years that that drive sales engagement. That said, I think, the unknown will be customer demand on the other side, and how customers behave particularly for those higher priced offers. That's a question, Mark, that we yet to see. Aman Bhutani : And then maybe just touch on the WooCommerce point. We have a great position in the WordPress ecosystem, the WooCommerce product. And we have a tremendous partnership with automatic as well there. So, we have a great offer in the market. Now, I mentioned that in my prepared remarks and our customers are loving it. So, we continue to like the offer we have there and continue to love customers coming to us with their WordPress and WooCommerce needs. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Aman Bhutani. Aman Bhutani : Thank you. I'll just say a quick thank you to all the employees across GoDaddy globally. A tremendous amount of work has gone in over the last few weeks that have been challenging to say the least. But while all of us focused on supporting each other every person at GoDaddy has worked hard to support our customers and for that I'm truly grateful. Now, thanks for joining our call today and we'll see you next time. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to hand the conference over to Mark Grant, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Mark Grant : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for GoDaddy's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. With me today are Aman Bhutani, Chief Executive Officer; Ray Winborne, Chief Financial Officer; and Andrew Low Ah Kee, Chief Operating Officer. Aman and Ray will share some prepared remarks, and then we'll open up the call for your questions.  On today's call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and operating metrics such as total bookings, unlevered free cash flow, normalized EBITDA and net debt. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents may be found in the presentation posted to our Investor Relations website at investors.godaddy.net or on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC with today's earnings release.  The matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements, which include those related to our future financial results, new product introductions and innovation, our ability to integrate recent acquisitions and proposed acquisitions and achieve desired synergies, potential tax and cash flow implications of the settlement and related leverage considerations of our TRAs, the expected impact of our recent restructuring as well as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, customers and employees. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, August 5, 2020, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events unless required by law.  With that, here's Aman. Aman Bhutani : Thank you, Mark, and thank you all for joining us today. Since March, there has been a massive acceleration in the shift to digital for small businesses around the world. Again and again, we hear from customers how vital it is in this time of global economic uncertainty for them to have both a dedicated website for their business and the tools to help them reach their customers. We consider it a privilege to serve millions of everyday entrepreneurs worldwide as we strive to help them build their businesses and refashion the economics of their communities.  As many companies benefit from the digital acceleration, I am excited that GoDaddy has continued to gain share. I want to start today by acknowledging GoDaddy team members. The level of activity in our business and our operations are at their highest, unmatched by the personal challenges all of us face in the current environment.  In June, we announced a restructuring of our outbound sales team. And while it is always difficult to part ways with team members, we are grateful for their contribution over the years. Our team members are working hard and have adapted quickly to address the rapidly changing landscape.  The strong financial results for Q2 speak for themselves. We are pleased with the results and more importantly, with our position to grow with our customers well into the future. We are seeing strength across many parts of our business, and I want to highlight 3 items in particular. First, GoDaddy surpassed the significant milestone of 20 million paying customers. In Q2, we added more than 400,000 customers, delivering the strongest quarter of net customer growth in our 20-year history, aside from when we acquired HEG. This was driven by favorable trends, including stable retention rates and record gross customer adds in the quarter. Both of these trends were impacted positively by the strong market demand coupled with investments in marketing. We will continue to invest in marketing for as long as the returns stay within our threshold.  Second, we continue to create demonstratable value for existing and new customers by adding features and functionality to our products, such as marketing tools, video streaming, security options and bulk purchase experiences. We also made it easier for our customers to use and experiment with our products. We added a freemium experience for Websites + Marketing in Q1. And in Q2, we added Sellbrite e-commerce offering to the freemium lineup.  Third, we took a set of decisive actions from a position of strength to further optimize our business for long-term growth and cash flow generation. As mentioned, in June, we restructured our U.S. outbound sales team as its sales motion had become unsustainable due to COVID-19. And today, we fully settled the TRA at an attractive return profile while preserving both our liquidity and our ability to further invest going forward. Lastly, we are happy to announce that we have closed on the acquisition of Neustar's registry business, and we look forward to unlocking value through vertical integration in the domain space. Ray will provide more details on these topics in his remarks.  Let's dig into customer growth and creating value for customers. Wow, second quarter of 2020, net new customers growing over 200% year-over-year getting us to 20 million paying customers. Lots of fantastic 2s and 0s in that sentence. It demonstrates just how much GoDaddy has grown since becoming a public company 5 years ago. In fact, in those short 5 years, we added nearly 7 million customers. GoDaddy continues to attract new customers to the ecosystem at a rapid pace, and those customers are seeing real value. Our retention rates are consistently high and continually stable, an ongoing testament to both the value and the criticality of our products and services to the small businesses we serve.  We continue to be the global leader in the green phase where customers name their ideas. In recent months, we brought together the greatest strength and capabilities of GoDaddy and the Uniregistry business, forming the GoDaddy Corporate Domains team. We added best-in-class new functionality for bulk purchasers, and our sales teams signed their first deals together. We also continue to see strength in primary domain sales, domain add-on and aftermarket transactions. How a business shows up online matters more now than ever before. And this is one of the reasons you continue to see our Domains segment growing more than double the industry growth. While we love our outsized growth in the green phase with its $5 billion TAM, we are most excited about how Websites + Marketing and Managed WordPress allow us to pursue the $175 billion TAM within the create and grow phases where everyday entrepreneurs build their ventures. Our customers want to do more with us. And we continue to invest in features and functionality that will let them accomplish this, especially in marketing and commerce.  In Q2, annualized recurring revenue in Websites + Marketing grew approximately 60% year-over-year. The common tier of our Websites + Marketing product accelerated even more quickly over the last few months, with net adds for our commerce tier growing 60% quarter-over-quarter and almost 90% year-over-year. In fact, 25% of new Websites + Marketing subscribers are opting for the commerce tier at nearly double the historical adoption rate, making it a bigger part of our [indiscernible]. With our commerce tier of Websites + Marketing for $25 per month, everyday entrepreneurs get a strong set of simple, easy-to-use tools to build their ventures online. Bundled with that is search engine optimization, best-in-class platform integrations with unlimited posting and tools for selling, including fee listings on Google, enhanced local delivery options and 1 year of branded e-mail. All of that backed with our award-winning guidance delivered 24/7 by our Care Guides worth hundreds of dollars all included.  For our customers, beautiful, engaging content is at the heart of their marketing. The GoDaddy offering with Over lets them do just that. In June alone, more than 14 million pieces of content were created and exported. That doubled year-over-year. The pace of user growth also accelerated. That doubled quarter-over-quarter with more than 1.7 million users engaging with Over every month. We are very excited to get the full functionality embedded in Websites + Marketing.  GoDaddy is the only company whose strength in create and grow transcends both captive CMS and WordPress. As a global champion for WordPress and the largest WordPress host, we are excited to bring new capabilities to the WordPress ecosystem. Already, our efforts in improving ease-of-use for WordPress are showing strong results. There are nearly 8,000 themes available in WordPress, and our Go Theme has quickly risen into the top 8. We are proud to be part of the open source WordPress community and the continued growth we see in Managed WordPress is great encouragement for us to continue to invest in the product.  We also saw Business Applications growth reaccelerate to 18% year-over-year, and that goes back to the frequently changing circumstances in which our customers find themselves today. Many of our customers relied on in-person interactions or inbound phone calls to brick-and-mortar stores as the means for their customers to engage with them. With many of those storefronts closed, customers have been adopting branded e-mail as an additional means to communicate with their customers. This is yet another way GoDaddy can help everyday entrepreneurs thrive while driving growth in our business as well. Our focus on adding customer value in a strong demand environment powered a strong second quarter and sets us up well for the rest of the year. We are poised for sustainable, profitable growth for the long term and continue to be confident in our ability to hit our 4-1-1 goal, $4 billion in revenue, $1.1 billion in unlevered free cash flow organically in 2022.  With that, here's Ray. Raymond Winborne : Thanks, Aman. I'll touch on the financial results for what was a great quarter for GoDaddy and then provide our outlook for Q3 and the full year. Q2 reflected better-than-expected results on every key metric from top to bottom, as the business performed very well, setting us up for continued success through the remainder of the year and beyond. Aman mentioned customer growth, but we've also seen flat customer churn rates and resiliency in subscription renewals, proof points to the durability of the business model.  Total revenue came in at $806 million, growing over 10% on a constant currency basis, with 140 basis points of currency headwind, and we're seeing the strength globally with U.S. and international both growing at a 10% clip in constant currency. Looking at product categories, we delivered 11% growth in Domains on strength in new registrations, renewals and aftermarket sales. Hosting and Presence grew 4%. Inside that, we saw terrific growth in subscriptions of Websites + Marketing, along with the e-commerce solutions Aman talked about earlier. This line item also reflects the headwinds from our higher-priced GoDaddy social product, which was disproportionately impacted by COVID-19. And finally, Business Applications growth deaccelerated to 18% year-over-year on higher demand for domain-based e-mail and productivity solutions.  Total bookings grew to $936 million, rising 12% on a constant currency basis, with roughly 1.5 points of currency headwinds. The strength was broad-based across products and geographies. We were well positioned to capture demand as businesses adapted their models, establishing an online presence in response to the COVID pandemic. And we've seen incredible response to our Websites + Marketing offering as we introduced the freemium option early on in Q2. Gross margin was 64% in the quarter, down slightly sequentially as we saw a mix shift towards the Domains and Business Applications product lines. For modeling purposes, we anticipate the product mix and in turn, the gross margin, to look similar in the second half of the year. We delivered approximately 3 points of operating leverage year-over-year with G&A continuing to benefit from both scale and lower discretionary expenses. Leverage in G&A and care were slightly offset by the investment in marketing that we started to ramp in the second quarter. The net sum resulted in normalized EBITDA of $162 million in Q2 or approximately 2 points of margin expansion over last year.  Moving to cash flow. Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter was $186 million, growing 11% year-over-year with unlevered free cash flow margin up about 30 bps year-over-year. Trailing 12-month unlevered free cash flow was nearly $790 million, and margin topped 25%, illustrating both the size and scale of this business. Now I want to take a moment to discuss the specific financial impacts of the restructuring to our U.S. outbound sales team we announced at the end of June. We recorded a $39 million restructuring charge in Q2. None of those impacted had accepted other roles. 582 team members ultimately received the transition package with a combined dollar value of approximately $15 million, $10 million of which was recorded as a charge in Q2, while the remainder will hit in Q3. We also exited leased office space in Austin, and as a result, recognized an impairment charge of approximately $29 million of our right-to-use assets. Actual cash outlays for the restructuring will be excluded from future presentations of our unlevered free cash flow metric. And you can see in the full year guide, we plan to reallocate these go-to-market savings to other marketing activities.  Now on to the balance sheet. We finished Q2 with $773 million in cash and total liquidity of nearly $1.4 billion. Net debt landed at $1.6 billion or about 2x net leverage on a trailing 12-month basis, the low end of our targeted range. And we have no significant debt maturities until 2024. Earlier this week, we closed the previously announced acquisition of Neustar's registry business, our third completed acquisition this year. We look forward to welcoming Nicolai and team as we extend the value chain in the dream phase of the customer journey. We've completed the preliminary purchase accounting work and due to the magnitude of the adjustment to the deferred revenue balance, we expect the rebranded GoDaddy Registry to contribute minimal revenue in 2020. Our estimate of the contributions to unlevered free cash flow remains at less than $10 million for this year.  As announced today, we reached an agreement to settle our TRAs, eliminating $1.8 billion in future cash payments for a onetime payment of $850 million. This is a terrific outcome for GoDaddy. We feel great about this transaction because, one, at current tax rates, the implied rate of return exceeds our borrowing cost by 6 percentage points; and two, we believe it's likely that tax rates will go up in the future, so the actual savings will be much greater, further enhancing our returns. We'll fund this transaction with a combination of cash on hand and new debt. Post transaction, while the net leverage of roughly 3x, leaving us at the midpoint of our targeted leverage range with ample liquidity to fund the business, execute strategy and pursue our stated capital allocation priorities.  The strength and resilience of our recurring business model has fueled a strong balance sheet. And when unique and attractive opportunities like the TRA arise, we have the flexibility to take advantage and create long-term value for our shareholders.  Before I get to the outlook, I want to take a moment and reflect on the financial progress GoDaddy has made in the last 5 years since our IPO in Q2 of 2015. Quite simply, our focus has been creating customer value, sharing in the economics of that value creation and being good stewards of the business. The proof points of the outcomes : since Q2 2015, we've increased customers by approximately 50%; we have increased revenue over 100%; and we've increased unlevered free cash flow by more than 200%. Pretty impressive growth statistics. And we're well positioned for the next 5 years. We will continue to be prudent allocators of capital in the pursuit of long-term growth and levered free cash flow per share. With that, let's turn to our outlook for Q3 and the full year. In the third quarter, we expect total revenue of approximately $835 million or 10% growth year-over-year. For Q3, you should expect double-digit growth in Domains, mid-single-digit growth in Hosting and Presence and high-teens growth in Business Applications. Remember, those products that relied on the outbound calling motion like GoDaddy Social disproportionately impact the Hosting and Presence line. For the full year, we expect revenue growth of approximately 10%, with bookings growth outpacing revenue by about 1 point. On unlevered free cash flow, we expect 2020 to land in a range of $815 million to $825 million, as go-to-market savings from the restructuring are reinvested to drive long-term growth.  As you can see in the Q2 numbers and the forward guidance, the current demand environment merits incremental investment so you should expect us to delever in marketing and tech and dev in the back half of 2020.  As a reminder, Q4 has a highly anomalous 27th pay period, without which our unlevered free cash flow guide would have been $18 million higher.  In closing, we're playing offense as GoDaddy continues to gain share in an industry experiencing an acceleration and an ongoing secular shift to online commerce. We are more confident than ever that our strong and predictable cash flow will allow us to take advantage of opportunities and create significant value for our customers, employees, communities and shareholders for years to come. And now I'll turn it back to Aman before we open up the call for Q&A. Aman Bhutani : Thank you, Ray. It has been 1 year since my first GoDaddy earnings call. In that year, I have talked to many everyday entrepreneurs and fallen in love with their story. I have seen an employee base that deeply cares about the mission of the company and has risen to unprecedented challenges. While there is still uncertainty ahead and no one has a crystal ball, I am inspired by the opportunity in front of us, and our path forward is clear. Our focus on customer success drives our continued development of world-class products. That, in turn, empowers everyday entrepreneurs to sell and thrive online.  We have an incredible brand that is only getting stronger. We have a resilient, recurring business model, and we will continue to be prudent stewards of the significant cash that GoDaddy generates, pursuing growth organically and inorganically for years to come. GoDaddy is an amazing success story. We have a TAM of $180 billion and 20 million paying customers. And I feel like we're just getting started.  Operator, let's open up the call for questions. Mark Grant : Operator, can we have the first question, please? Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our question comes from Deepak Mathivanan from Barclays. Deepak Mathivanan : Great. Congrats on a good quarter. I wanted to ask about a couple of things. So first is can you give us some color on the customer profile that you're seeing? The net adds of 400,000 was very strong. And like said, it's nearly 3x last year. How much of that on-ramp is coming from Domains? And how much of that would you say you can attribute to Websites + Marketing and then also some of the e-commerce products?  And then the second question is on the Hosting and Presence. Obviously, you're seeing nice tailwinds on the e-commerce and also websites. But the overall growth is 4%. I know it's impacted by the social offering and then also the do-it-for-me cleanup. But can you give some color on the size and growth of each bucket so we can think about the confidence inside this correctly? Aman Bhutani : Thanks, Deepak. This is Aman. I can take the first part, and Ray can probably take the second. We're seeing customer growth across all the product categories. We saw growth in Domains. We -- as you see, we saw growth in the biz apps and Websites + Marketing, and Managed WordPress continue to grow at a healthy rate, right? So it's not really about one product or the other. We're seeing growth across all products, and it's a function of the demand environment and the marketing spend and the value that our products bring to our customers on sort of everyday basis. We're excited about the acceleration. And the quarter continue to improve for us, and we're excited about that. Ray, do you want to take the question? Raymond Winborne : The only thing I might tack on to that, Deepak, you may have heard Aman reference to it. We are super excited about the growth we're seeing in Websites + Marketing, 60% growth year-over-year in ARR. That is a fantastic growth rate, and so you could see the adoption and more excited about even the mix of SKUs within that adoption. So we've seen a nice uptake in e-commerce SKU takes, let's say, I think, 25% of folks taking that SKU now. So really excited about the progress we've seen there in that product. Deepak Mathivanan : Okay. Ray, if I can just follow-up on that. How much would you say the impact from the restructuring efforts is on the 3Q revenues? I mean, I know previously, you quantified it for 2Q. How should we think about that for 3Q? Raymond Winborne : Yes, if you think about 3Q and the rest of the year, you saw the impact of the headwinds in the second quarter, it's baked into that guidance for the rest of the year as well. Operator : And our next question comes from Matthew Pfau from William Blair. Matthew Pfau : Just wanted to hit on the premium offers that you've been providing on the websites business. Maybe you can just discuss how those have been performing relative to your expectations, both in terms of interest and conversion. And then what are your thoughts on using the strategy longer term, both for the existing products that you're offering it for or perhaps expanding the two additional ones? Aman Bhutani : Yes. Thanks, Matt. The freemium offering is a quarter in, and we continue to be excited about how it's performing, both in terms of attracting registered users to come in and try the product and the conversion rates we're seeing. And so it's meeting our expectations, and we continue to drive improvements in it. In terms of freemium as a model, we really feel that our customers more and more people need to be able to use our products. So the freemium model allows us to do that in a successful way. And one of the things you saw this quarter is that we added the freemium offering for Sellbrite, which is a product that allows micro small businesses to connect to many of the large platforms out there and get their products out there. So it's really a model that we're using for more and more products.  And one last thing to keep in mind is that when we talk about the 20 million customers, we're talking about paying customers. That does not include freemium customers in that number. Andrew Low Ah Kee : Matt, it's Andrew. I'll just tack on one other thing. Ray mentioned we're leaning into marketing. And obviously, we've got the convictions to lean into marketing based on what we're seeing in their early. So... Matthew Pfau : Got it. Just one quick follow-up. [Technical Difficulty] good based on the growth that you're seeing in the websites business. But what about visibility into the future quarters, are you able to get any idea in terms of predictability of what the conversion of some of those freemium users will be? And how does that perhaps help you in terms of the visibility in your business? Aman Bhutani : Yes. I think it's a bit too early to be able to sort of set the quarterly cohorts up. We're still, like I said, only a quarter in. But over the next few quarters, we'll definitely have a clearer idea of how those cohorts perform. Early indications, they continue to meet our expectations. So we're excited to continue to move forward on it. Operator : And our next question comes from Ron Josey from JMP. Ronald Josey : Aman, you started off the call just talking about the massive acceleration of digital, and we're seeing that in your subscriber growth numbers, freemium, e-commerce adoption, et cetera. Just wanted to get your take on where do you think we are in the shift to digital and the importance of -- we just talked about importance of freemium but with 20 million subs and more freemium coming on, I just want to know, like, where do you -- curious of your thoughts on where you think we are in overall adoption of this digital transformation and where GoDaddy is there? Aman Bhutani : Yes. I do think that COVID-19 has pushed a number of people past the point of inertia where they were not adopting digital. Another way to say that is pull forward the TAM. So because people have no choice but to go digital to support their businesses, we're seeing people experimenting with ideas. We're seeing people come online, even though they had hesitated to do it in the past. When you look at that TAM of $180 billion, and it's just huge. This is a space with so many players there. And when I look at GoDaddy, I think we're really positioned well. And when I talked in the script about I feel like we're on the start line, I look back at GoDaddy and see a leader in the dream phase, doing so well in the create phase over the last 2, 3 years. And now as we put more and more attention into the growth phase, customers want to do marketing tools with us, they want to do commerce with us, and we have good offerings for them. So the more we get our name out there related to those offerings, the more we improve those offerings, I expect GoDaddy to play a very significant role in that moving forward. Operator : And our next question comes from Nick Jones from Citi. Nicholas Jones : I guess just two. First on strategic acquisitions. I mean, how do you feel about the pipeline today given kind of market multiples? And any kind of thoughts kind of how you view the environment? And then the second question would be on kind of customer acquisition and increasing investment in advertising. How do you feel about kind of the, I guess, the advertising window? Are CPM lower today and you're able to be more aggressive? How long do you think that will last from kind of where we stand today? Any color there would be helpful. Aman Bhutani : Yes. As you know, we've been quite active in the acquisition space over the last few months, just talking about closing Neustar today and super excited about that. Our pipeline continues to be healthy. And of course, valuations are what they are. But we continue to look for opportunities, which can add value to our customers and become part of the GoDaddy ecosystem.  And broadly speaking, we are looking for opportunities where customers get nonlinear value, and our brand extends to be able to offer that value to customers. That's kind of the lens we're looking things at. And there's a healthy pipeline.  In terms of customer acquisition, our customer acquisition costs actually went down quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. And part of that is the CPMs, but a big part of that is just demand and intent from customers.  So as we look forward, our commitment is that we'll continue to invest in marketing, looking at this demand, taking share within this demand as long as it meets our thresholds. Operator : Our next question comes from Brent Thill from Jefferies. Brent Thill : Aman, nice to see the Business Apps reaccelerate. I'm just curious when you look at the opportunity set ahead, it seems pretty massive. How are you gaining better awareness? And where are you finding the best areas for adoption? And then for Ray, can you -- maybe companies we -- I cover and check have been commenting on how things look in the month of July and August. I'm curious if you have any comments about how you exited the quarter. And was there a sugar high tail-off? Or are you still seeing the continued strength that you saw at the end of Q2? Aman Bhutani : Yes. On the business apps, the focus for the teams there is to continually improve, not just sort of awareness of that product when people come to our site or through our marketing channels, but really, really reduce the friction in terms of activation, the friction in terms of fulfillment. So that adds a customer step into that product. They're able to really get value very, very quickly. And some of those efforts that we've been making over the last few quarters has started to show value.  Now clearly, part of the reacceleration here is the overall environment where customers are looking for avenues to contact their customers, and we've been telling them for years that if you use branded e-mail, you have many multiples more likely to get the attention of your customers than a regular e-mail address. And in a time like COVID, where our micro businesses, small businesses are looking to reach their customers, they're sort of thinking about all the things that we've been telling them. And we think we see that acceleration coming in Business Apps through that. And I'll turn it to Ray for sort of July and so on. Raymond Winborne : Yes. Brent, so good trends. As we look toward the quarter, it was nice progression, continued increase right up through June. I think if I recall back then, maybe it was Andrew that pointed it out on the last call saying that April -- the April cohort was our strongest we've seen in 10 years. May was better. June was better. And then we saw no slowdown in the July cohort. That should give you some sense of what we're seeing in the business. Operator : And our next question comes from Jian Li from RBC. Jian Li : Jian for Mark Mahaney. And congrats on the quarter. So just maybe piggybacking on the last answer, just given the accelerating trend you're seeing from -- in Q2 and into July, what assumptions are you baking into your Q3 guide in terms of the kind of new user growth? And what kind of macro assumptions are you baking into that? And I'm thinking that given your full year and Q3, are you assuming that macro getting better in Q4 and therefore, the higher price pressure that you're seeing that's in H&P right now will be more alleviated? I just want to see if you have any thoughts on that. Raymond Winborne : Yes. It's Ray. I'll take that one. Look, there's a lot of uncertainties at play right now. We're trying to call it like we see it, not being overly aggressive or conservative in the guide. It just reflects what we know right now and our sense of trajectory.  If you look at the guide we're giving, it does imply some acceleration from the pre-COVID Q1 number. Keep in mind, the back half of the year gets a little tougher on year-over-year comps. In the demand environment, it's obviously been great. Aman talked about some of the stats and metrics we're seeing. But we don't have perfect insight into how long or at what strength that's going to continue. We're always going to strive to do more, be better every day. But the guide is what we see happening, plus or minus. Jian Li : Great. And if I may, a follow-up on the Neustar acquisition. I know it's early days, but have you looked at maybe medium term, the size of the opportunity there? And how should we think about kind of the margin accretion potential from Neustar? Aman Bhutani : Yes. I think we're just coming upon closing it, we -- just a couple of days in. So it's a bit too early to be talking about the medium-term return on Neustar. Suffice to say, we're super excited about being able to vertically integrate within the Domains space. It opens a lot of opportunity for us to create new offerings for customers to experiment at a pace and scale that we don't think the registry business has seen for many years. So that's the opportunity we're going after. And we'll be able to talk about it a lot more over the next quarter or so. Operator : And our next question comes from Ygal Arounian from Wedbush Securities. Ygal Arounian : I want to ask Ron's question maybe slightly differently and how to think about the sort of pull forward and runway of increased need for digital presence relative to the 400,000 net new customers this quarter. As we look forward, is that a number that we should kind of continue to expect to be at that level? Are we at a new run rate for new customers for the time being too held back off a little bit? Is the mix of growth coming a little bit more from new customers or ARPU? Just how to think about and frame this discussion in terms of new customers going forward. And then the second question, when you guys announced the restructuring without a lot of questions from investors around trying to understand exactly what the outbound sales team was versus the inbound sales team. So can you help just make sure to clarify and help investors understand what the outbound sales team was. Was it all related to GoDaddy Social? And then at the same time, what are you seeing from the inbound sales team in terms of productivity as we're continuing to work from home? Aman Bhutani : Yes. If I got sort of three parts to that question : first, around net customer growth; the second around revenue breakdown subscribers versus ARPU; and third around outbound sales. Maybe I'll get started and Andrew and Ray can jump in. On the net customer growth, obviously, we're super excited about the 400,000 number. It's massive. It's our best quarter ever if you take out the HEG acquisition. And it's really something that is a function of the demand environment we see and the work that GoDaddy has been doing. In terms of looking forward, as you know, we don't guide to net customer growth, but we do share that data with you over time, especially on a milestone basis. And given that this was such a big milestone, we felt that it would help sort of you see the things happening in the business.  In terms of the breakdown of subscribers versus ARPU, I think we continue to see that healthy mix. Obviously, the subscriber growth is very large. But we continue to see that, I would say, stable ARPU growth that this business has demonstrated for many years. So that's -- together, that's been really good. In terms of the outbound sales motion, as we discussed, our outbound sales is a very particular motion. It was honed over the years. And COVID-19 did impact it significantly. But I'll turn it over to Andrew to share a bit more detail on it. Andrew Low Ah Kee : Yes. Our outbound sales team was a small portion of our overall care operations. We got a history, as you all know, of uniquely selling, whether in an inbound motion or in an outbound motion. That outbound motion was a discretionary one, right? The inbound one, we take a customer's call. We have an obligation to answer the phone when they call us. On the outbound side, that's a discretionary thing. And as we looked at the productivity challenges that we were facing and what we expected ahead, it made sense for us to stop that motion and reallocate that investment, as Ray mentioned, into other marketing activities. As we -- and that outbound team, yes, they focused on social, but they focused on a range of other higher-end products and services.  On the other side, with respect to productivity, we obviously took a hit there. As we've shared with you in the past, we've seen steady and continuous progress around improving it. We've embedded the level of productivity we expect to see into the guide that Ray mentioned. And importantly, we have seen consumer behavior change as we've gone through COVID in terms of how they choose to engage with care. Increasingly, it's around asynchronous chat, other digital channels, some of which we talked about in our Investor Day, but we're really seeing those different modes of engagement come to the fore in this current environment. Operator : And our next question comes from Lloyd Walmsley from Deutsche Bank. Lloyd Walmsley : First, are there any key product holes you guys would flag in Websites + Marketing, where if you kind of either add a product or improve a part of it a lot, you feel like you can unlock meaningful new TAM or growth acceleration? And secondly, when you guys announced your deal with AWS, there was talk of kind of working together, maybe AWS selling some of GoDaddy services. Wondering if there's been any movement on that side of the relationship. Is that something we should think about for the future? Aman Bhutani : When we think about Websites + Marketing and the opportunities, they're squarely in what we talked about, the grow phase for our customers. And 2 areas that we're investing in are marketing and commerce. To give you a bit flavor, marketing includes content. Marketing includes messaging, right? And when we did the Over acquisition, and we're bringing it into Websites + Marketing very, very quickly. So all of the great feature functionality engagement that Over has, all Websites + Marketing customers are going to have that this year very, very quickly. Those marketing capabilities are really core to our micro businesses reaching their customers. And similarly, as we all know, commerce is a big part of it as well. And we have a great base offering in commerce. And the more our customers use us, the more we're adding features and functionality for them in the commerce space as well.  In terms of AWS, we've had some good milestones in terms of progress in our relationship there. But overall, it continues to be relatively small. We think it's a great sort of example of what GoDaddy can do for a big partner. But in the revenues -- in the total size of our revenues, it's a small item. Operator : And our final question today comes from Naved Khan from SunTrust Robinson. Naved Khan : We've been renamed Truist Securities, so change of name. But I had a couple of questions. In your April update, you guys have -- had talked about some weakness in the Domains aftermarket. Curious to know if that still persists. The results kind of indicate it might have improved. And the other question I had was just around the -- your onboarding ramps for the new customer acquisition. Is it fair to assume that with the addition of the freemium offering and the revamp in the Websites + Marketing product, it's becoming more meaningful. Is it source of new customer acquisition versus maybe just a year ago? Aman Bhutani : Yes, Naved, thanks for your question. On the aftermarket, like we said, we're seeing great traction in primary, secondary Domains sales. Overall, that business or that segment growing at 10% for us, as you know, growing much faster than double of the industry. So we're super happy with that. We did -- we had, in April, talked about some weakness in there. And there are pockets of different experiences by different countries that we're seeing. But overall, very happy with the results in that segment overall.  And in terms of freemium and Websites + Marketing, the 60% ARR number just says it all, right? We continue to see healthy growth in that business on a unit basis, on a revenue basis. Super excited about what it means for the future. And it's massive LTV, right? The Website + Marketing customer drives somewhere in the order of 10 to 25x the LTV than a Domains customer for us. So being in that space, being a big player in that space and gaining share in that space has been really good for us. Operator : And that concludes our questions today. I'll now turn the call back over to Aman Bhutani, CEO, for closing remarks. Aman Bhutani : Thank you, and thank you all for joining on the call today. A big thanks to all GoDaddy team members all over the world for a great quarter, and look forward to talking to you next quarter. Operator : And this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

With that, here\u2019s Aman. Aman Bhutani : Thank you, Mark and thank you all for joining us. Today, I\u2019m excited to share the details on a record quarter for GoDaddy. Before we get started, though, I want to announce a change to our leadership team. Andrew Low Ah Kee, our Chief Operating Officer is leaving GoDaddy effective November 13, after nearly a decade with the company. As a colleague and friend, I\u2019m grateful for his significant contributions over the years. He was a key part of building the great company we have today, and I wish him all the best in his new adventure, which will be announced over the next few days. We stand today with a deep leadership bench, including both tenured and new leaders organized to deliver on the needs of our customers and our strategic priorities. With this full complement of leaders in place, we will make a few adjustments, but we will not backfill the COO role. This will allow for a seamless transition so we can stay focused on executing against our strategy, and every day our passion for that strategy grows as more entrepreneurs trust and partner with GoDaddy to start with a dream and then create and grow that dream. We are pleased with our progress, and today I would like to highlight three key areas. First, our strong execution against our strategy with a few notable milestones. Second, our continued progress in online presence solutions, including leaning into commerce capabilities. And third, our continued investment in marketing to capture demand. Q3 was another record quarter of customer growth, and we are seeing sustained momentum into October. In Q3, we once again, added over 400,000 net new customers while also seeing improved customer retention. We continue to see increased demand for online solutions due to the pandemic and coupled with higher marketing spend our website traffic has increased by an average of 20% year-over-year since April. We have seen increased adoption of our website creation platform, websites plus marketing and managed WordPress as well as our content and commerce tools, Over and Sellbrite. As an additional insight into this part of the business, we are excited to share that together this solution reached an annualized recurring revenue of nearly $350 million in Q3 growing at approximately 40% year-over-year. This group of products now account for more than 2.2 million subscriptions growing over 20% year over year. Additionally, this quarter we saw an acceleration of Sellbrite\u2019s GMV growth between websites plus marketing and Sellbrite GoDaddy now has more than $4.5 billion of annualized GMV transacting through our platforms, growing at nearly 80% year-over-year. These proof points reinforce our strategy of driving scale in the growth phase for customers by focusing on commerce. Business applications as a product line continued to accelerate in the third quarter, surpassing the milestone of 3 million customers with nearly 9 million seats of email. Best of all, these numbers continue to grow at a healthy pace. While we\u2019re pleased with the growth in these key areas, we\u2019re not resting on our laurels. We\u2019re driving product enhancements and increasing our marketing efforts to facilitate profitable long-term growth. We continue to charge towards the massive opportunities of content creation and commerce. This quarter, we accomplished this through deep partnership integrations, internally developed software releases, and an important commerce acquisition. In partnerships, we recently announced a deeper integration with Facebook\u2019s business extension, GoDaddy websites plus marketing customers can now create shoppable posts as well as set up shops on both Instagram and Facebook with automatic syncing between both platforms offering yet another channel for our customers to easily sell their products. Additionally, our new partnership with Vimeo allows customers to upload, preview, and insert videos, including using a video as a header to their website. We\u2019ve also continued to accelerate our velocity internally, delivering a busy product launch schedule in the quarter. We released a full integration of our Over app within websites plus marketing a short few months into the acquisition, making it even easier for customers to market their businesses with creative content. This seamlessly intuitive experience has driven over 50% growth in posts. We\u2019ve also extended the Over app across 12 new languages giving more customers access to this powerful set of tools. Additionally, GoDaddy released a powerful social composer dashboard in websites plus marketing, giving customers a single place to rapidly create polished social content and view and schedule their social posts across connected social media platforms. What\u2019s more, users can track the performance metrics of each post by platform. We also introduced a simple and intuitive one page e-commerce template in websites plus marketing, which has quickly become our most popular template and it has reduced time to publish for our customers by 40%. Continuing on the theme of commerce, we launched our online store capabilities in Argentina, Peru, Colombia, and Chile positioning GoDaddy to serve customers in these markets. We also continue to innovate for our domains customers. In Q3, we introduced revamped box search and file upload tools for domain investors and rolled out free global WHOIS masking and new paid security services with greater domain protection. And we\u2019re super excited to welcome the SkyVerge team with nearly 60 WooCommerce extensions spanning payments, email marketing and memberships, SkyVerge is a leading WooCommerce product developer. This acquisition furthers our commitment in WordPress to help entrepreneurs and web professionals succeed online with high performance stores that are feature rich and quick to build. Lastly, in Q2, we talked about our plan to delever marketing for as long as we continue to see returns on our investments. While the investment increased, we also delivered another record quarter for both customer ads and total cohort size. Obviously, it\u2019s something we\u2019re quite pleased to see, particularly as we\u2019ve coupled these strong marketing gains alongside the great product enhancements we\u2019ve talked about today. In closing, our focus is to build simple and easy to use tools with a focus on helping everyday entrepreneurs succeed. Online commerce and marketing are areas where this need has become significantly more pronounced in 2020. We are seeing rapid adoption of these new tools, giving us the opportunity to help more customers succeed, solid execution in an elevated demand environment powered a strong third quarter. We are poised for sustainable, profitable long-term growth, and we continue to be confident in our ability to hit our 4-1-1 target in 2022. With that, here\u2019s Ray. Ray Winborne : Hey, thanks, Aman. I\u2019ll touch on the financial results for what was a great quarter for GoDaddy and then provide our outlook for Q4. Q3 reflected a strong performance across the board with another record quarter of customer growth, an acceleration in top-line growth and margin expansion, and new customer bookings continue to hit records. while small relative to total bookings, they\u2019re an important contributor to future growth. We\u2019ve also continued to experience low customer churn rates and resiliency in subscription renewal rates, proof points to the durability of the business model. Total revenue came in at $844 million growing 11% year-over-year while currency impacts were negligible. growth rates accelerated across all three product categories and reaccelerated in our international business. Business applications was our fastest growing product line increasing 19% year-over-year on continued strength in branded email and productivity solutions. We delivered 12% growth in domains across new registrations, strong renewals and aftermarket sales. And finally, Hosting and Presence grew 6%. inside that, Aman highlighted the tremendous growth in products comprising our website creation platforms. In contrast, it also reflects a headwind from the GoDaddy social product due to the elimination of the outbound sales force in June. Total bookings grew to $945 million rising 11% year-over-year while currency impacts were negligible. strength in bookings was broad-based across products and geographies as our brand and product offerings positioned us well to capture demand as businesses continue their digital transformation. For many small businesses establishing an online presence was once seen as a competitive advantage. It\u2019s now table stakes. gross margin came in at 66% in a quarter, a 40 basis point expansion year-over-year. we also delivered operating leverage as the June restructuring actions reduced costs and care while G&A continued to benefit from both scale and lower discretionary expenses. As we highlighted on the second quarter call, we stepped up our investment in marketing to capture market demand resulting in a $36 million year-over-year increase in marketing expense. We\u2019ve been able to elevate our investment while remaining within our target months to break even and customer acquisition costs even as we saw increased competition and performance advertising channels, and we\u2019ll continue to invest in marketing as long as we\u2019re meeting our return metrics. the net sum resulted in normalized EBITDA of $199 million in Q3, or approximately two points of margin expansion over last year. Moving to cash flow, unlevered free cash flow for the quarter was $224 million, growing 17% year-over-year with margin expansion of over a point. trailing 12 month unlevered free cash flow was over $800 million and margin topped 25% illustrating both the size and scale of this business. Now, on to the balance sheet. we finished Q3 with $622 million in cash and total liquidity of over $1.2 billion. We were able to capitalize on favorable market conditions, issuing a new $750 million, seven-year term loan with an all-in yield of 2.7%. A record for a BB rated company. with this issuance, net debt stands at $2.5 billion or about three times net leverage on a trailing 12-month basis. That\u2019s the middle of our targeted range of two to four times and we have no significant debt maturities until 2024. If you have our ability to deleverage, this leaves more than ample liquidity to fund the business, execute the strategy and pursue our stated capital allocation priorities. Now, I want to take a moment to reiterate that any potential increases to the corporate tax rate will not have an immediate impact on GoDaddy\u2019s cash flow. As a reminder, given our net operating loss position, we don\u2019t expect to pay U.S. cash taxes before 2027, a higher corporate tax rate would however enhance the value of the recent settlement of the TRA. For example, a 28% rate increases the future tax savings associated with the TRA attributes by over $700 million, further enhancing the already strong returns on the settlement. The strength and resilience of our recurring business model has fueled a strong balance sheet and has enabled us to execute across to our capital allocation priorities in 2020, including completing four acquisitions, repurchasing, nearly 6% of our outstanding equity and settling the TRA. We have the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities that arises and will continue to be proven allocators of capital in pursuit of long-term growth and leverage free cash flow per share. With that, let\u2019s turn to our Q4 outlook. We expect total revenue of approximately $865 million, or 11% growth year-over-year. You should expect double-digit growth in domains, mid single-digit growth in Hosting and Presence, and high-teens growth in Business Applications. Remember those products that relied on the outbound calling motion like GoDaddy social disproportionately impact the Hosting and Presence line. on unlevered free cash flow, we expect 2020 to land at approximately $820 million, the midpoint of our previous guidance range. As a reminder, Q4 has a highly anomalous 27th pay period this year, without which our unlevered free cash flow guide would have been approximately $18 million higher. In closing, digital migration is definitely an accelerating trend and it\u2019s here to stay. Our business is well-positioned to meet the needs of entrepreneurs around the globe as they bring their ideas to life online. GoDaddy has long been known as an industry leader with profitable growth at scale, now with a set of subscription software tools, enabling websites, content creation, and commerce, that\u2019s approaching $350 million in annual recurring revenue. We\u2019re as confident as we\u2019ve ever been that we can continue to grow, take, share, and generate significant cash flow. with that, we\u2019ll have Christie Masoner from our Investor Relations team, open up the call for questions. A - Christie Masoner : Thanks, Ray. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein at Oppenheimer and Company. Please go ahead. Jason Helfstein : Thank you. So, you noticed 400,000 nets ads in \u2013 over 400,000 net adds in the third quarter. Can you comment how the second quarter compared to this? And then when we think about versus a year ago, can you just comment on customer churn? Are you seeing higher or the same churn? And then secondly, appreciate the $350 million ARR gross bookings. If we \u2013 or the $350 million ARR related to e-commerce, if we divide that into gross bookings, it\u2019s about 9%. Is that a reasonable way to think about kind of sizing the e-commerce business today relative to gross bookings? Thanks. Aman Bhutani : Hey, Jason. Thanks for that question. This is Aman. When we look at the third quarter, it represents record organic net sub growth for GoDaddy. We\u2019re really happy with the progress here and as we look at Q2, like we said, in some of our prepared remarks, October continued to be in line with September and did really well year-over-year as well. And in terms of churn rates, they continue to be stable slightly better. Just going back to the idea that our customers truly are the everyday entrepreneurs, and if they hit roadblocks, they\u2019re creative, they innovate, and they start something else and get on with it. And then, I\u2019ll turn it to Ray for maybe a little bit more color and to your second question on the $350 million. Ray Winborne : Hey, Jason. it\u2019s Ray, ARR is not apples-to-apples, obviously, with booking. So, it\u2019s cash versus revenue, but really happy with what we\u2019re seeing there from those products. From a booking\u2019s perspective while we\u2019re growing at relatively similar levels. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Nick Jones from Citibank. Please go ahead. Nick Jones : Great. Thanks. Could you touch on some of the integrations you talked about in the press release and the deck today, what kind of users are you seeing or by subs with these integrations, whether it\u2019s over Instagram, Facebook, and then I guess the follow-up on that is as you integrate all of these great products for subs like Vimeo, SkyVerge, things like that, how does that impact kind of the funnel for subscribers? I guess how do you prevent them from getting confused by, I guess all the options you\u2019re introducing? Thanks. Aman Bhutani : Yes. let\u2019s take the specific examples from previous quarters, and then I\u2019ll briefly touch on SkyVerge and how we look at the funnel. Our goal bringing in over, bringing in the experience from Uniregistry was that we wanted to bring to the GoDaddy family companies, teams that were building amazing experiences for customers, sort of best-in-class experiences. And then we want to take those experiences and bring them into our mainstream products like Websites + Marketing. So, when we talk about Over\u2019s integration, it\u2019s all very new right now. So, it\u2019s less about what subscriptions it\u2019s driving, and it\u2019s more about what level of engagement we\u2019re getting from the functionality we\u2019re putting out there. For example, with the Over integration, there was a 50% increase in posts, sort of content creation and people posting that content on social media which shows immediate customer value. And that\u2019s our core formula, right. We want to introduce these pieces whether it is Vimeo or others into the core experience, add the right place. It\u2019s not early in the funnel. It\u2019s as these customers are using these products, it shows up in a simple way at the right place, and it\u2019s just intuitive for the customer to use it. And as we continue to create customer value, over time we can turn it into shareholder value by sort of moving people through the tiers, by taking pricing actions and such, but the first step is really creating customer value. And in terms of SkyVerge, it\u2019s the same formula, SkyVerge team is fantastic in the WooCommerce space, and they have 60 plug-ins. they just are completely focused on building the best experience for customers, and it\u2019s super new right now, but well you can expect the same thing from us that it will become part of our managed WordPress experience, and it will just be simple for customers in terms of their commerce experience with WooCommerce as well. to touch on the funnel just slightly, keep in mind that as we add these capabilities, they are coming in at the right place where the customer is using the product, they \u2013 these things don\u2019t sort of in a sense; clutter the buying experience or the freemium experience in any way. In fact, if anything, as we layer on more and more capability and provide it as part of the freemium package, it \u2013 we feel it encourages people to use the product because they\u2019ve got more functionality that they can use as part of the product. Nick Jones : Great. Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Ron Josey from JMP securities. Ron, please go ahead. Ron Josey : I think I\u2019m unmuted. Hopefully, you can hear me. great quarter, guys and Aman, thank you for the additional details on the business metrics. I wanted to talk about commerce specifically, the $4.5 billion in GMV and also the integrations with Facebook and Instagram that you just talked about, but can you just talk about what tools you think are still needed to fully take advantage of this commerce opportunity that you\u2019re seeing with the 80% growth in GMV or do you have \u2013 do you think you have a fully integrated approach now to fully take advantage, and then as a follow up to that, can you talk about sort of we\u2019re two quarters into the freemium approach with Websites + Marketing, a quarter in with Sellbrite, just talk out how freemium has maybe changed the complexion of these new subs and these record new subs that are growing to the \u2013 growing on the platform. Thank you. Aman Bhutani : Yes. Happy to do that, Ron. Thanks for the question. on the first piece about the $350 million and just the color, we\u2019re super-excited about that part of the business and how quickly, it\u2019s growing, I think I\u2019m blanking on the exact word you said, but just on the second part of your question, when I look at the sub\u2019s growth, what I\u2019m really focused on is are we providing the customers the product that they can try out? And as an example, you mentioned, Sellbrite. Sellbrite is doing really, really well, right. The GMV growth that we\u2019re seeing, it\u2019s fantastic, but it\u2019s because we\u2019re getting the product in the hands of customers and more, and of merchants are quickly using, Sellbrite. by the way, we\u2019re seeing the same in Websites + Marketing. freemium means that more customers are using it. And yes, we\u2019re a couple of quarters in and what that\u2019s done is it\u2019s given us enough confidence that we are rolling the freemium piece out sort of 10% to 20% at a time. It\u2019s not 100% percent in the U.S. yet as we get into every part of our website and our sales path, that\u2019s the place we\u2019re going into. Ray Winborne : And Ron, it\u2019s Ray. I want to clarify one point on that, within our customer count number, does not include freemium. Those are paid only subscriptions. So that record organic growth is for paid subscriptions, not freemium. Aman Bhutani : Yes. And I\u2019ll also clarify the numbers that we gave for subscriptions. The $2.2 million doesn\u2019t include subscriptions for over or Sellbrite. Those are core Websites + Marketing and managed WordPress. And what we say, what we believe is that over and Sellbrite sort of the customers use that as part of our core platform. And then you asked the question, fixed to hit back to me around gaps, in our offering. the commerce offering is driving a ton of that growth in those suite of products, right. So that\u2019s really fantastic and we serve the needs of a certain set of customers really well already. The way I think about it is that as we grow to sort of cover more and more customers, we are going to have to add feature set. And that\u2019s sort of an order of operations say, what\u2019s the next thing that we need to go after and let\u2019s build that capability or buy that capability, put it in place, and then offer it to customers in as simple a way as possible. Ron Josey : All right. Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Ygal Arounian from Wedbush securities. Ygal, please go ahead. Ygal, please mute your line. Ygal Arounian : Okay. Can you hear me now? Christie Masoner : We can. Ygal Arounian : All right. Great. Thanks. So, I wanted to ask about a couple of big picture questions, one related to commerce and where you\u2019re doing there. And obviously, you\u2019re doing a lot, it\u2019s a feature that everything in space as kind of growing, pretty competitive across the space. You guys have always viewed yourselves as focused on that micro businesses. So, what you\u2019re doing here, when you think about SkyVerge and Sellbrite integration into Facebook and Instagram. do you guys see yourself playing in that market, in the e-commerce specifically? is it still kind of focused towards that micro-SMB? just does that change any of your philosophy in terms of go-to-market and who your target customer is? And then related to that, I think, a lot of investors think of GoDaddy\u2019s still very exposed to SMBs, which you are, and I think that\u2019s something, maybe some people have a hard time getting over in terms of the risk from COVID and businesses shutting down and the overall health. we saw in 3Q, new business applications for SMBs, but really businesses in general were up over 50%. So, there\u2019s a lot happening in that space too. Is there anything, you\u2019re seeing that gives you extra confidence, Aman, you touched on entrepreneurs and shutting down, and reopening, but what are you seeing within businesses, closing and opening and that overall environment that gives you maybe, more or less confidence than typical environments. Thanks. Aman Bhutani : Yes. Thanks, Ygal. Let me address sort of the target customer micro-SMB commerce, part of the question, and then take some of the pieces on turn and what exposure we see in the SMB space and then Ray can touch on it too. If we take a step back and go, what we\u2019re seeing in the numbers, is that customers our customers, people that have great relationships with GoDaddy are coming to us and saying, I want a commerce offering from you. We shared with you a quarter or two ago that 25% of customers signing up for websites, plus marketing or signing up for the commerce tier. These are people by themselves going there and saying, I want this product from GoDaddy. So, what we\u2019re focused on is when we see those early signals and we see people started to click stuff, we\u2019re like, this is an offering that we have the right to serve, right. This is a target segment of customers that have the best relationship with us, let\u2019s meet their needs. And my view on the competitive space and such is that there is so much opportunity still in the micro businesses, in the everyday entrepreneur space that we define that there is really a lot to do that. And my view is that as we look into the future, there\u2019s no difference between a micro business and an online micro business. Every micro business is going to be online, right. That\u2019s just how people are going to find things. That\u2019s just how people are going to want to transact, because it\u2019s going to be simpler for them and it will allow them to scale in a way that previously they couldn\u2019t. in terms of the exposure, and I\u2019ll just point again, to the steady churn rates at GoDaddy and this is the creativity of the customer. And maybe, for one click deeper, I\u2019ll turn it to Ray and say, do you want to talk a little bit more about that? Ray Winborne : Yes. Ygal know, I mentioned this maybe, on the last call, but a lot of our competence is coming from the recurring nature of the business model. A couple of things that point out to your very point, our core customer is a solopreneur, right. it\u2019s one to five employees in a lot of cases. And when they get knocked down, they get backed up. We\u2019re providing them all the tools they need for $20, $25 a month. It\u2019s an incredibly valuable service through them. And it\u2019s one of the primary reasons our customer retention rates. It\u2019s been so strong for gosh, 20 plus years now. I think folks have consistently gotten it wrong about what\u2019s perceived to be as exposure to volatile small businesses. These are entrepreneurs, not necessarily small businesses. So, when one fails, they pick up the next idea. Aman hit on the renewal rates, they\u2019ve been very stable. The natural flow renewal event is roughly evenly spread over the year for us for 10 months in 2020, seven and a half months into the pandemic and renewal rates are holding. So, it\u2019s instilling confidence in us despite the uncertainty in the market. Ygal Arounian : Great. Thanks so much, very helpful. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Brent, please go ahead. Brent Thill : Thanks. Ray, 11% bookings. I know you had a tougher 15% comp, I guess, with all the talk of e-comm and business ops, more attached. I think maybe, some thought you would see a little more acceleration than that. I\u2019m curious if you can just comment on the puts and takes, and kind of what you\u2019re seeing, I know it\u2019s all not going to flow in, in one quarter, but it seems like directionally, you\u2019re heading in the right direction. Ray Winborne : Yes, Brent. Obviously, your recall last year was a really tough comp, there was over a point of lift and bookings related to credit card abuse. So, I think one, I would look at net bookings as a cleaner view of the growth, which is closer to 13% year-over-year. beyond that noise, I mean, Aman hammered it in the opening comments, we are seeing historic growth in new customer ads. But remember that new bookings are small relative to the base, it\u2019s roughly 10%. So, you\u2019re not going to see that inflection immediately, but we\u2019re super-critical for future growth. And there is strong demand for our offerings in the market. We\u2019re investing to maintain that while maintaining our threshold. So, you saw us pour on the marketing. we\u2019re seeing the results of that and new is growing very, very strong, Brent Thill : And you\u2019ve been fairly colorful in past calls. Just looking at what\u2019s been happening inside the quarter and linearity, was there any color just as it relates to, was it fairly steady on improvements throughout the quarter, or was it evenly based? How would you describe the linearity of the quarter into the start of this current quarter? Thanks, again. Ray Winborne : Yes, I think what I would say is we hit the peak midsummer. The growth rates are still spectacular. I mean, these are record growth rates, but we\u2019re starting to see some seasonality, some waning and demand in the market, but I would still tell you, these are our historic growth rates that we\u2019re looking at right now. Brent Thill : Great. Thanks. Ray Winborne : Bottom line, the guy that we put out reflects what we see from a trajectory standpoint for Q4. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau from William Blair. Matt, please go ahead. Matt Pfau : Hey, thanks for taking my questions, guys and a great quarter. Just wanted to ask on the guidance. So, full-year revenue expectation up a bit from your previous expectation and free cash flow expected to be in the sort of middle of the prior range. So, is this related to you, liking what you\u2019re seeing from the increased marketing spend and continuing to lean into that? Or is there something else going on and then on gross margins as websites, and e-commerce continue to be a faster growing component of your business? How do we think about that impact on the gross margin? Aman Bhutani : Yes. Matt, on the revenue growth, glad you\u2019re noticing we\u2019re happy with what we\u2019re seeing there from an acceleration perspective and what we\u2019ve messaged in the past remains true. Any upside we see in cash flow, we\u2019re putting back into the business. We invested a lot in marketing this quarter. We\u2019ll invest again, in the fourth quarter and we\u2019re going to continue to lean in there as long as we\u2019re seeing the returns. on gross margins, don\u2019t forget, Q2 was weighed down by the COVID impacts at the top line with honestly, no relief in cost as we maintain salaries across the board. Q3 does include a benefit now consolidating GoDaddy registry, right. We talked about that acquisition and the benefits there of eliminating the domain costs that we formally paid out to an external party. My final thought on gross margins, though, right. We\u2019ve consistently messaged for forward modeling, keep us both safe by staying in that mid-60s. Yes, you\u2019re right. As we move more into these software centric offerings, those are higher margin, but we\u2019re continuing to put more into that bundle and we want to maintain the flexibility on pricing. So, I think it\u2019s still mid-60s is a good place for your models. Matt Pfau : Great. Thanks, guys. Appreciate it. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from RBC Capital Markets. Mark, please go ahead. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Two questions. One, any more color on the marketing that you\u2019re talking about, and are there channels that are working better for you than those in the past? I think in the middle of the year, there was probably some very good ROI out there to be had as those with the kind of a pull back and marketing from a lot of different verticals. I assume that the ROI has become a bit more back to pre-COVID norms, but just talk about what you\u2019re seeing in terms of ROI and in channels. And then one other question related to marketing, and that is the lax customers \u2013 customers that were on the GoDaddy platform in the past. Have you had much success during this kind of time of must be really elevated demand for digital presence solutions, and you had success being able to go back to some of those lax customers and getting them to reengage with GoDaddy? Thank you. Aman Bhutani : Thank you, Mark. Regarding the first part of your question on the marketing cost and the return we\u2019re seeing, we continue to see strength on the brand side as we have historically core metrics like [indiscernible] brand awareness consideration, something we measure, which has for people like me, we continue to see sort of good performance and numbers heading in the right direction. Our performance marketing continues to show strength as well. You\u2019re right, there were some differences in the quarter and cost per impressions that have gone up a bit. We\u2019re still seeing good cost per impression for the business as a whole. And the overall result, as we mentioned, it has been amazing. We had \u2013 we have a super valuable cohort. It\u2019s the biggest cohort in the company\u2019s history, which is the third quarter cohort. And it\u2019s not as big as, we\u2019re growing every quarter, or every year. This cohort is 30% sort of more valuable than other cohorts. It\u2019s really, really a big increase in what we\u2019re seeing. In terms of the lapsed customers, and as we talked about, a lot of our customers stay with us even after their ventures go away. So we \u2013 some of that happens within our system already, it\u2019s not new, but I\u2019m not aware of anything special in terms of that changing during COVID, but I\u2019ll turn it to Ray to see if there\u2019s something he wants to mention about that. Ray Winborne : Yes. Mark, let me pull a little finer point on that. The growth in new purchases from the existing base is year-over-year relative to the trend before COVID not as high as we\u2019re seeing certainly in the new customers, but still solid growth year-over-year. So, definitely, demand spiked as well and the existing base. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thank you very much. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Zgutowicz from Rosenblatt Securities. Mark, please go ahead. Mark, please unmute your line. Mark Zgutowicz : Sorry about that. A couple of questions on W + M and I got on the call just a little late, so I apologize if this question was also already asked, but just on the freemium side of things. I was curious what the read is initially on conversion and what sort of the dynamics that you\u2019re seeing. I know it\u2019s been a, I guess, a couple of quarters now, just sort of your thoughts on how that model has played out in the future. And then a second one is just in terms of trajectory, revenue trajectory of W + M over the next 12 months, is there a greater pricing component in the \u2013 I guess pricing unit next equation. And is that sort of required as you think about, your cops obviously will be heading against the summer comps if you will, is there necessarily a greater pricing mix necessary? Appreciate that. Thanks. Aman Bhutani : Thanks Mark. On the freemium piece, yes, there are a couple of quarters in, and it\u2019s given us the confidence or the experiment has given us the confidence to continue to roll out freemium. It\u2019s still early to talk about specific metrics on that \u2013 on those cohorts. But generally we\u2019re happy with the experiment. This is the path forward for us, and we want more and more and more customers to be using our freemium products, and we will get better and better and better at converting them over time. The more features that that we\u2019re including in the freemium product, sort of the more usage we see we\u2019ll be able to optimize a number of things over time. In terms of pricing and I don\u2019t think we can comment much in terms of what pricing actions might be there in the \u2013 going into next year or what we need to do, but I\u2019ll turn it to Ray, to see if there\u2019s some commentary that he wants to include here. Ray Winborne : Yes, Mark, I think if you look at the disclosures we made this quarter around those products, there\u2019s a mix of both volume, unit growth as well as positive mix. The percentage of customers coming in at the higher tiers that has been favorable since COVID hit. So that\u2019s helping as well, but, yes, no comments specific comments around what that will look back in the next 12 months. Mark Zgutowicz : Okay, great. Thanks guys. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Barclays. Deepak, please go ahead. Deepak Mathivanan : Hey guys, can you hear me? Christie Masoner : Yes, we can. Deepak Mathivanan : Great. Two questions. So first on the e-commerce side, you obviously improved the product pretty nicely and a lot of features said, and also have done a lot of integrations. When should we expect modernization initiatives, particularly in areas like payments shipping, potentially partnerships on fulfillment, and also seeing in a lot of other areas where some of your peers generate nice revenues. And then the second question is, a little bit related to the customer cohorts, given a big renewable base, it\u2019s some are harder for us to parse out, but can you provide some color on the quality of the customers that you\u2019ve seen over the last, three, four months in the more recent cohorts? How much is the art book higher compared to your typical customer? What\u2019s the term like, and what are the additional products that they are buying? Thanks. Aman Bhutani : Yes, I\u2019ll take the first and Ray can take the second. On the e-commerce side, Websites + Marketing is going amazingly well by itself and the commerce tier is growing much faster than Websites + Marketing overall. So, yes, we were improved. We\u2019ve improved the product. We continue to invest in it, and we\u2019re seeing good results there. Good demand from customers there. In terms of monetization options, Deepak, the focus for us right now is to get the scale, right? We have a great offering by making it easier for customers to use by getting them premium tiers, by inserting more and more capabilities for them by increasing usage, like now [ph], increasing the use of certain features. We are creating that surplus for the customer. And definitely, the areas that you talked about continue to be future opportunities for us, but it\u2019s an order of operations. First, we want to get the scale and we share the GMV numbers with you. And then we want to look at the future options of monetization. And then I\u2019ll turn it to Ray for the second question. Ray Winborne : Yes. Obviously, let me talk about the size of the cohorts that we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of quarters being historically largest we\u2019ve seen, as far as performance, still, really early to be able to tell how they\u2019re going to perform over the longer period. We flashed up, a cohort we picked up in the great recession in 2008, you can see the long-term performance on that turned out to be right in line with other cohorts. So, I have no reason to suspect these cohorts are going to perform any differently, but we\u2019ll see over time. One thing I would point out is in these cohorts post-COVID, we are seeing a heavier mix of attachment for Websites + Marketing manage WordPress. Deepak Mathivanan : All right, thanks Ray, thanks Aman. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin from Piper Sandler. Brent, please go ahead. Brent Bracelin : Good afternoon. And thanks for taking the question here. I have two, if you could, certainly appreciate the record the customer growth you\u2019re seeing, but if I look at international in particular, it\u2019s the highest growth rate we\u2019ve seen in a year, two quarters of accelerating international growth. Could you just provide a little more color on, as you think about this, this record really strong customer growth, how much of it is coming from international and maybe what countries you\u2019re seeing adoption drive this acceleration? Ray Winborne : Yes, Brent its broad-based, right. We started, increasing the stand on marketing when we saw demand spike back in May, June timeframe. And that was pretty evenly split domestic and international. So, the incremental spend is going towards both of those and obviously seeing some nice improvement in trajectory there. Nothing specific to any one geo it\u2019s strong around the world. Brent Bracelin : Okay. That\u2019s super helpful. And then just one quick follow-up, as we think about kind of ARR, I think you\u2019re talked about that $350 million a year, our business growing 40% year-over-year. How should we think about that growth profile on an organic basis? I assume there\u2019s some acquisition kind of revenue in there. So, as you just think about ARR kind of organic growth potential, how should we kind of think about that go forward? Ray Winborne : Yes, vast majority of that\u2019s organic, right? Those acquisitions were both small on an ARR basis, less than 5%. Brent Bracelin : Okay, great. Super encouraging. Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Naved Khan from Truist. Naved, please go ahead. I Think Naved \u2013 we\u2019re going to have to skip you for a second. Our next question comes through the line of Chris Kuntarich. Chris, please go ahead with your question from Deutsche Bank. Chris Kuntarich : Hi, can you hear me? Christie Masoner : Yes, we can. Chris Kuntarich : Great. Maybe just on one of your milestones, you guys talked about, business apps customers now over three million. So that\u2019s roughly give or take mid-teens a percentage of your total customers. I think back in 2015, you had talked about roughly a 30-year customers were buying hosting. So, maybe two questions around that. First being is a third of customers purchasing, hosting from you guys still the right way to think about it. And then second on business apps. How would you think about the opportunity to kind of close that penetration of your customers to more maybe in line with where a hosting penetration is with your customers? Thanks. Aman Bhutani : Yes, I think, Chris, we continue to see great growth with business apps. And that we were able to attach that product along with domains were able to have customers reach us and we\u2019re offering sort of best-in-class service for them offering for them both in terms of tool set and in terms of support. And it\u2019s hard for me to talk about how the percentages may line up over the next few years, but generally speaking, we feel we have a great product. We feel that customers are very appreciative to have it. We see really good responses in terms of NPS, from customers on this product set. So we \u2013 our intention is to continue to invest into it and make it easier and easier for customers to use. We\u2019ve had a couple of sort of innovative ways of being able to somewhat support customers so that customers can get themselves set up with email in a really, really simple way. And then I don\u2019t know Ray, if there\u2019s anything else, that some of the other comparisons, I don\u2019t know, Chris, that you can sort of \u2013 they\u2019re kind of apples and oranges in my mind, but really, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019d add. Ray Winborne : Yes. Chris, only you might put on top of that is that, our focus both from a product perspective and go to market right now is only the software products, right? That\u2019s I suppose, marketing and manage WordPress and then all of the marketing tools that go in with that marketing commerce tool. So, less focused on hosting whereas we may have quoted back years ago. We now have more prominent software products that we\u2019re pushing on the go to market. Chris Kuntarich : Got it. Appreciate the color. Ray Winborne : You bet. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Drew Glaser from JPMorgan. Drew, please go ahead. Drew Glaser : Hey, this is Drew on first Sterling. So another question on the hosting area. So given the positive results in Hosting and Presence, do you think that you guys have hit the bottom in that segment and could we see improved growth in that segment going forward? Ray Winborne : Yes. Drew it\u2019s Ray. Obviously we saw a nice improvement, a lot of that being driven off the back of the growth in our software products there, I\u2019m still seeing headwinds and will until we laugh the restructuring actions we took in June. But I think, all clear as far as the pressure we\u2019re seeing there. Drew Glaser : Okay. Got it. And then secondly, so we\u2019re seeing a surge in new business applications, according to some government data. Are you guys seeing that benefit your business at all? Or could that start benefiting it and coming back? Ray Winborne : Yes, I think the fact that we had a record organic net customer ad this quarter in the company\u2019s history tells you, we are seeing the demand. Drew Glaser : Got it. Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes the line of Naved Khan from Truist. Naved, please go ahead. I think we don\u2019t have audio from Naved to apologies. Everyone, thank you so much for joining our call today. And I\u2019ll turn it back over to Aman. Aman Bhutani : Thank you, Christie. I\u2019ll just say a huge thank you to all GoDaddy employees all over the world for a strong quarter. And we\u2019re looking forward to the next quarter. Thank you very much.",

I\u2019m Mark Grant, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the call today are Aman Bhutani, Chief Executive Officer and Ray Winborne, Chief Financial Officer. Following prepared remarks by Aman and Ray, we\u2019ll open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] On today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and operating metrics such as total bookings, unlevered free cash flow, normalized EBITDA, net debt and gross merchandize volume. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents may be found in the presentation posted to investors.godaddy.net or on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC with today\u2019s earnings release. The matters we\u2019ll be discussing today include forward-looking statements, which include those related to our future financial results, new product introduction and innovations, partner integrations, our ability to integrate acquisitions and achieve desired synergies, changes to executive leadership as well as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, customers and employees.

Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, February 11, 2021, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events unless required by law. With that, here\u2019s Aman. Aman Bhutani : Thanks Mark and thank you all for joining us. Go Daddy exists to empower everyday entrepreneurs. Our mission is to make opportunity inclusive for all and the shift to digital represents the greatest opportunity for our customers to share their gifts with the world. With a differentiated offering, including guidance and tools within intuitive seamless experience, specifically designed and built for our customers, it is clear like customers continue to adopt our products and ask us for more. Everyday entrepreneurs are creative and resourceful and they want to be able to focus their time on their business from domain names email and content creation to commerce and soon they include payments and point-of-sale. Customer focus for us is about building a seamlessly intuitive experience that saves them time and unlocks capabilities through ease of use. In 2020, our digital presence was key for our customers and the increased demand led to accelerating bookings growth for the last three quarters for us. For 2020, GoDaddy neared $3.8 billion in booking and topped $3.3 billion in revenue. We leaned into the surge in demand with marketing spend and while we kept it efficient, the result was our best year of net customer ads except 2017, which included the HG [ph] acquisition. We welcomed nearly 1.4 million net new customers in 2020 by providing valuable products and offering the best care. We've also been able to maintain stable renewal rates and our churn metrics, well those have always been low and they still found room to improve in 2020. Early last year we spoke about our natural evolution into commerce. Everyday entrepreneurs are underserved and demanded from us and our investments have been focused on the simplest and most relevant commerce experience. No doubt commerce continue to be a giant opportunity for us. Internally, we are also evolving. We have made significant progress in implementing a broader experimentation program that allows us to more clearly measure the value we are creating for customers and deliver functionality faster. The discipline of measurement allows us to set more ambitious goals while also giving us the confidence to achieve them. We are moving faster, putting more products in the hands of more customers and winning the right to do more for them. Our leadership team is also evolving. 2020 was a year of milestone and clearly defining achievements for many GoDaddy leaders. After having truly accomplished herculean tasks both in 2020 and over their respective careers, our Chief Legal Officer, Nima Kelly and our Chief Financial Officer, Ray Winborne have each expressed a desire to retire at some point this year. They continue to be fully engaged with the company and will help with transition as we look to fill that incredibly big shoes. We have a strong leadership team with talented, tenured folks and with continued leadership from [indiscernible], we expect a seamless transition. We have strong internal candidates and we will be looking for external candidates for both roles as well. With acceleration in the number and also in our internal operating rhythm, I want to share three priority areas where GoDaddy will be bringing innovative solutions to our customers in 2021. Our top priority is commerce and 2021 is the year we will bring to market a holistic solution for everyday entrepreneurs that powers every facet of their online and offline commerce experience. In 2020, we created strong customer value with our commerce tools and GMV for websites plus marketing and Sellbrite grew 75% year-over-year. In 2021, GoDaddy will extend our current operating with a focus on delivering Omni-commerce solutions. Earlier this week, we closed on the Poynt acquisition and as you know Poynt extend our commerce offering with a set of products that span the full spectrum of commerce enablement. Poynt brings us payment capabilities as a payment facilitator and bring immense value to our customers through its innovative point of sale terminal, inventory management software, loyalty management tool and more. Poynt and Go Daddy customers are already seeing great success, represented by the combined $23 billion in annualized GMV that already flows through our platforms as we integrate and build the Go Daddy commerce platform it's scale will be backed by the 6,000 guides that are ready to provide guidance we know our customers need. To help drive focus and continued momentum in commerce, we have created a new commerce division within Go Daddy. Poynt CEO, Osama Bedier has joined Go Daddy and will leave this new division reporting to me. The next priority I want to share is about our pro customer. We already have a large group of designers and developers that are Go Daddy customers, but we know the opportunity is much, much larger. Last year our partners whose sole focus is to create value for designers and developers went back to first principle. Deep research into the customer needs led to a new set of solutions organized in three pillars. The first pillar is all about a seamless intuitive experience in the tools that we offer. In January we launched the hub for Go Daddy pros where website designers and developers can perform their work in a simple intuitive way that saves them time and money. The hub enables bulk updates across hundreds of sites for WordPress, plug-ins and Themes allowing pros to roll out updates for better security, new functionality and better availability. What may have taken hours now takes seconds and even works on WordPress sites now hosted by Go Daddy. Pros can also use the hubs built in project management tools and make it easier than ever to deliver customized sites for their clients. The hub let's pros manage all of their [indiscernible] in one place and built-in delegated access allows pros to collaborate with their clients more effectively to drive the results their customers want to see. The second pillar is all about care. Pros have told us that they value the kind of guidance and care we offer and they want us to do more. We have extended our care to support pros for all their WordPress sites, not just the ones that host with us. With additional care guides armed with a high level of training to support these pros, we are ready for the unique needs of this customer population. The third pillar to bring that altogether through marketing, with millions of pros out there, we have planned a marketing launch to tell them about the added value and capabilities we are bringing forward. It all begins with the laws of the Go Daddy Pro program. Signing up to be a Go Daddy Pro gets pros access to exclusive discounts for themselves and for their clients and direct access to the most advanced guide directly through the hub speaking their language exactly the way they wanted. Go Daddy Pro is live in the US with its first marketing campaign and in April, we will be hosting our first virtual Go Daddy Pro conference and we're just getting started. Lookout for more benefits of being a Go Daddy Pro and its global launch. The three pillars together embrace the needs of our Pro customers and enhance our relationship with them beyond a strong managed WordPress offering. Overall, our strategy is straight forward. WordPress is the largest CMS in the world with a market share of over 60% and growing. Pros know WordPress and prefer WordPress and our vision is all about making a seamless and intuitive while retaining all its power and flexibility. We are not interested in forcing pros to use a different tool. That sounds like a job participant. While it is exciting to talk about new offerings like commerce and Go Daddy Pro, under these exciting new businesses, is the solid foundation of our domains business and that is the third priority I want to talk to you about. Clear as we have outgrown the domains industry with innovative ideas and execution in both the primary and secondary market. That growth isn't going away anytime soon. Recently, we added Go Daddy corporate domain and Go Daddy registry, which promise to offer new and existing customers with innovative solutions, but that isn\u2019t all. Our client team has really stepped up their experimentation velocity. These are the folks that run the search algorithm on Go Daddy.com. We are building an adaptive user experience, which leverages multiple inputs including the customer's profile, liquidity, it's context, the available results and also available add-on to make sure customers see the options and bundle that will create the most value. Our aftermarket has also seeing tailwinds from the digital transformation of small business. More businesses coming online is resulting in more customers leveraging our domain broker service to help them secure the perfect name for their online presence, even if someone else already owns it. Our new list for sales rule has also seen an incredible first inning. This tool let's customers with unused domain names, list them in our aftermarket and in just three months, we've seen over 350,000 domains get listed. The outcome here is a continued acceleration in this business as more customers are matched with better offerings and are exposed to attach opportunity as well. Most of the financial impact of this accelerating innovation and domains is still to come and we are confident that the outperformance we have seen in this category will continue well beyond 2021. At our scale, innovation like this, not only drives growth, but also helps one exciting new initiatives across the business. I look forward to sharing more on the three priorities I just went through as the year progresses. Before I wrap up, I know that many of you are eager to hear about the results of our websites plus marketing freemium offering. In less than a year, it has shown itself to be an area of real promise for Go Daddy. Beginning in the spring of 2020, we conducted a small-scale experiment presenting our freemium offering to a limited number of visitors. Over the course of the year, we steadily increased the number of US base visitors that would see this offering to approximately 50% and we are pleased with the results we've seen along the way. Millions of sign-ups and solid conversion rates that we're happy to note are higher than what we had seen elsewhere in the industry. There is certainly more to be done and this is an exciting outcome as we work to make freemium a tailwind to our business for years to come. Looking at 2021, while there are many unknowns and many things we plan to accomplish, we continue to see evidence in our business that supports aggressive forward momentum. As Ray will share through focused execution, Go Daddy delivered a strong result in 2020 in the face of many challenges. Our core strategy of creating value for customers and converting it to shareholder value over time is working. We are evolving as a company and are in a fantastic spot as we enter into 2021. With that, here is Ray. Ray Winborne : Thanks Aman. I'll touch on the fourth quarter financial results and our outlook for 2021. Despite the operational challenges caused by the pandemic, we delivered a strong performance in 2020. We added 1.4 million net new customers, nearly double the number added in 2019. This was complemented by a decrease in our already low customer churn rates and resiliency in subscription renewal rates as our products and services became even more valuable to our customers. Full year revenue grew 11% year-over-year while our free cash flow was up 12%, even as we invested more marketing to capture higher demand in the market. We also took advantage of the opportunities created by the uncertainty deploying $1.8 billion capital adding capabilities for customers and creating value for shareholders. Turning to the fourth quarter results, we saw continued acceleration in topline. Bookings grew $943 million rising 13% year-over-year reported in constant currency basis as FX had little impact on the quarter. Growth was broad-based with continued strength across product categories. Revenue came in at $874 million outperforming expectations and growing 12% year-over-year. Business applications was again our fastest growing product line, increasing 20% year-over-year on continued strength in branded email and productivity solutions. Domains accelerated to 14% growth as new registrations, renewals and aftermarket sales remained strong along with a modest contribution from Go Daddy registry and finally, hosting new presence grew over 5% in the fourth quarter. We continue to see terrific growth in our website creation platform products. Through the strength was tempered somewhat of the headwinds from the Go Daddy social service due to elimination of the outbound sales motion in June. The key metrics underlying our growth remain consistently strong, ARPU rose to $166 up 5% year-over-year while the customer base grew 7%. Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter was $181 million and $825 million for the full-year. This reflected good operating leverage in the P&L as well as reduced capital expenditures for corporate real estate and infrastructure as we transition more workloads to the cloud. Gross margin remained in the mid-60s in the quarter consistent with our expectations. We continue to ramp investment in marketing to capture increasing demand, resulting in a $40 million year-over-year increase in marketing expense. As we mentioned last quarter, we've been to elevate investment while remaining within our targeted return metrics, even as we saw increased competition and performance advertising channels. On the balance sheet, we finished the year with $765 million in cash and total liquidity of nearly $1.4 billion. Net debt landed at $2.4 billion putting net leverage at 2.6 times on a trailing 12 month basis, illustrating our ability to deleverage quickly. The strength and resilience of our recurring business model has fueled a strong balance sheet, enabling us to execute across our capital allocation priorities. During 2020, we completed four acquisitions, repurchase nearly 6% of our outstanding equity and average prices substantially today stock price and settled the TRA at an attractive valuation, removing an overhang to stop. All proof points that we have the flexibility to take advantage of opportunity as it arises. Rest assured, we'll continue to be proven allocators of capital in the pursuit of long-term growth and levered free cash flow per share. As we look to the future, continued growth and cash flow a strong balance sheet will provide us with the flexibility to deploy roughly $5 billion in capital through 2023. Moving on to our outlook for 2021, we expect to deliver revenue of approximately $3.7 billion representing growth of 12% versus 2020. From a product category perspective, we expect double-digit growth in domains, high single-digit growth in hosting new presence and high teens growth in business applications. This guidance includes $20 million in revenue we expect from the recent acquisition of Poynt. As for Q1, we started the year off on pace and expect to deliver revenue of $885 million represented a 12% growth versus last year. We expect 2021 unlevered free cash flow of approximately $945 million or 15% growth versus 2020. This guidance reflects continued investment in marketing and product plus $20 million in net delusion from Poynt as we build out our capabilities in commerce this year. Finally, I'd like to provide some additional modeling points for the full-year 2021. We expect bookings to grow at a rate similar to revenue and normalized EBITDA margin to be roughly flat as compared to 2020. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $65 million, income tax benefits of $25 million and cash interest payments of $100 million based on current debt outstanding in today's forward rate expectations. We announced my retirement today and I want to thank all of you who have been along for the ride. I've had an incredibly rewarding career and to have blessed to have been able to top it off at Go Daddy. It's been my privilege to serve with this amazing group of people dedicated to such a noble mission. We navigated a lot of change as Go Daddy has evolved into a truly customer-centric company, obsessed with creating value for customers, employees and shareholders. This last year was challenging for a lot of people, but also very rewarding as I've been able to witness our leadership team taking bold, decisiveness and strategically sound actions that help our customers employees through an incredibly turbulent year. As to what's next, I plan to be deeply engaged in the search for a successor and I'll stay on to ensure a smooth transition. I look forward to speaking with all of you again next quarter. With that, we'll have Christie Masoner from IR team open up the call for questions. A - Christie Masoner : Thanks Ray. [Operator instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ron Josey from JMP Securities. Ron, please go ahead. Ron Josey : Thanks Christie and Ray congrats on the decision. We'll miss you that we have a few quarters and happy new year Aman. I wanted to ask a few questions maybe Aman on commerce that was the first pillar that you mentioned as a focus area with Poynt now websites and marketing adoption of the millions, I think new EC templates, I think our $23 billion in GMV, $7 billion of which through website and marketing. Can you talk to just a little more how you view ecommerce unfolding across Go Daddy going forward. The tools appear to be in place, you got the scale. So what's next? And then Ray, just real quick on the guidance with EBITDA flat year-over-year and I'm assuming that's continued investment in marketing and product, is that the way to think about it, thank you? Aman Bhutani : Ron, thanks for the question and yes, commerce continues to be our number one priority and you're right, you laid it out really well with websites plus marketing in place, Sellbrite also growing quickly, which you didn't mention, also huge opportunity for us in the WooCommerce space, we haven't talked about that much but you know about the SkyVerge acquisition that is helping us bring a program that we call a new Woo, that we'll talk about in the future as well. So yes,, all those things coming together Poynt adding those core capabilities as a payments facilitator invoicing point of sale and the idea is to bring all those pieces together and continue the pace of acceleration. If you just look at GMV for websites plus marketing and Sellbrite, the annualized number we gave you last quarter was much lower than the one you're seeing today and that itself represents quarter-over-quarter acceleration. Ray Winborne : Ron it's Ray. Appreciate the kind words first, but our normalized EBITDA margin were holding that flat year-over-year, which we're pretty pleased with given the investment we're going to put in place. Both in products, Poynt will be a big piece of that. I mentioned in the call comments that we've got net delusional about $20 million around commerce and we'll continue to invest more in marketing this year as well. So those are the two big drivers our normalized EBITDA margin. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Ygal Arounian from Wedbush. Ygal, please go ahead. Ygal Arounian : Hey guys, thanks for the question and I echo the sentiment on Ray congrats. I am assuming that even big shoes to fill. I guess a couple questions, so first if we could just Aman you gave some good commentary on Prohub. Maybe if you could talk about the go to market strategy, I guess marketing around that, how the sales and customer service team will help drive that initiative and can you also talk about how many pros versus the outliers are using your services today. So maybe a little bit more just big picture around how that evolves. And then you domains I think outperformed and you talked a little bit about some of what's driving that. So how is the Neustar acquisition, the synergies you're seeing there, how much is that contributing? Can you talk about some of the things that you put in place specifically from that acquisition and how that can add to growth in the coming years? Aman Bhutani : Happy to take that, on pros, let's start with the numbers because I think that was in the middle of your question. We have about 1.5 million pros as part of our 21 million customers. So we already have a lot of pros that engage with us on a daily basis. We know that the opportunity is much, much larger and what the pro hub is about is it was about going to the pro scene, what do you guys need in terms of the interface and then building that in a manner that works best for them. And the go to market strategy around it, the Go Daddy program that at all about pro signing up and getting benefits, benefits that over time grow and there is a marketing campaign now in place in the US that is getting word out to say, hey, here is all the new things, the new experience where you can do a whole lot, you got project management tools, you got care with a click through messaging that our guides in the background, there are more guides in number. They have higher level of training and they can execute on more acts from the pros than ever before because we've opened up the aperture of what they can do. So it's the combination of both -- of all of those things that we're really excited about and then in terms of sales and marketing, no doubt care will continue to play a role there, but this is not an outbound motion and what we're really seeing is that pros want to engage with us on the web, they want to engage with care through messaging, they want to move things quickly, They don't even want to wait two minutes for a base load. They don't want to spend hours updating their sites. They want it done in one click and those are the type of capabilities we're opening up here. And then on domains, Ray will take the sort of contribution for Neustar, but just to remind you and it's still super early for us with Neustar, the innovation that we plan to bring to the table is all about having the full stack, being able to innovate on the registry side and the registrar side and bring new offerings and talked about that a little bit in the past. So I'll turn it to Ray to just talk about synergies and contribution as you asked. Ray Winborne : Yeah, Aman hit it on the head. This was more about the strategy and verticalization on domains. This is a future benefit to us as we get more control over the domain costs, which is one of our largest cost in the P&L. You think about contribution to the topline Ygal, the purchase accounting impacts from Neustar absolutely muted the impacts on the top line. If you're looking year-over-year, '21 contribution inorganic contributions for Neustar are going to be roughly half a point on the topline. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer and Company. Jason, please go ahead. Jason Helfstein : Thanks, kind of want to ask about acquisition and then leverage. So first point with a very strategic even acquisition but not particularly expensive. If we think relative to free cash flow you guys generate a year, if we think about kind of your acquisition pipeline, would you say more of the acquisitions look like point in site or are you potentially looking at something that might be bigger and then if not bigger, again given the amount of free cash flow you generate and how the company is very well positioned you're seeing very good customer retention. Why not leverage particularly in this environment we thought was the number one question we get investors, why not run this business at 3.5 to 4 times leverage and just accelerate kind of the free cash flow per share return to shareholders, thanks? Aman Bhutani : Thanks Jason. Maybe I'll start and Ray can comment at the end of that. One, I love the idea that you agree that the point is strategically important acquisition and it wasn't very expensive. Those are great acquisitions, I love them but to answer your question, we are looking at the who spectrum Jason. We absolutely agree that many of the core part of our strategy it's in my DNA, it's in the company's DNA. We're good at it. We've done it before but as we're out there looking at the assets as you know it's a competitive or sort of difficult time in the marketplace and we're trying to make sure that the assets we look at truly form part of the advantage we want to create because at the end of the day, what we're looking to have is that simple, intuitive experience. So there is million things I talk about Ray. I'm talking about ease-of-use. I'm talking about saving people time. I'm talking about product interfaces of that truly are magical that lead to high NPS and all the acquisitions we're doing or looking at big or small have to fit into that full. So I wouldn't have anyone think that we're not interested in large acquisitions. We absolutely are, but just we've got a formula we're working it and should be opportunity to you'll find us at the table and Ray, I'll turn it to you for levering up and such. Ray Winborne : Yeah Jason when you think about leverage, right, we've had a targeted two to four tons leverage since we've been public and we've been at the very top of that range when the opportunity presented itself and we've been more about balancing our capital allocation priorities. You saw every flavor of it in 2020. We leaned in the marketing, put a lot of money into organic growth because the opportunity presented itself. We closed on four acquisitions last year. We bought back stock and we also settled the TRA's. So we're really using that cash flow that incredibly strong and consistent cash flow that you talked about to drive significant returns for the company. And we do see the opportunity to Aman's point, we're certainly not hesitant to take our leverage to four times. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Drew Glaser from JPMorgan. Drew, please go ahead. Drew Glaser : Hey this is Drew on for Sterling, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could provide some more color on how much of the 2021 revenue growth is coming from acquisition? Ray Winborne : Hey Drew, it's Ray, when you look at the inorganic contribution on an incremental basis in '21, it's about a Poynt right. $20 million or so that's coming from Poynt, I just mentioned on I think it was a Ygal's question earlier that Neustar is about another half a point there. So those are the two big biggies that are contributing and it's around that one point contribution. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Nick Jones from Citi. Nick, please go ahead. Nick Jones : One on premium, as you announced visitors for the site and people are converting to the premium offering, is there time to enter the freemium and eventually convert and then I guess when is some of the timing to conversion for freemium as they kind of when they convert to the site. Aman Bhutani : Nick, the question wasn\u2019t totally clear, but I think I caught most of it. On freemium, what we're seeing is that customers do come in and the metrics we're looking at includes seven-day conversion and 90-day conversion right. There isn\u2019t naturally fixed number of where everyone makes a decision. You continues to see a sort of the tale of people converting over time. Both the seven-day and 90-day, especially as we got into later in the year on the 90-day conversion, we started to have a few cohorts that were reasonable site and we continue to sort of see stable conversion in that 90-days rheum which is what we talked about. In terms of I didn\u2019t fully catch this part of your question, but I think the objective of freemium for us is to open up the aperture to allow our customers without friction to try our products but we fundamentally believe that whether you look at websites plus marketing or Sellbrite, which we also turned freemium last year, the value that customers get compared to the price that we charge, really there is a tremendous amount of value and we want to remove any hesitation customers have of trying to use those products. These products are built from the ground up to the exact needs of our customers and we if feel we open up the aperture and get more customers to try that over time it's just going to build a greater and greater battery that leaves to better financial outcomes over time. Nick Jones : And one follow-up on M&A, you laid out dream create manage, we like that growing probably the pipeline is and where you're trying to focus in terms of essential M&A across the trends you laid out? Aman Bhutani : Our priorities on M&A are aligned with our broader priorities as a company and those priorities simply we are the leader in Dream and we absolutely have some intention there. We're making great progress in creating, that's fantastic, but we're putting disproportion about the time and energy resources integral and that's how our M&A team is prioritizing as well because actually create and grow off are more and more working together and that's a massive opportunity and when we talk about our $180 billion TAM, a huge percentage of that is within the growth phase. So that's where the majority of our energy is. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Kessler from Raymond James. Aaron, please go ahead. Aaron Kessler : Maybe just on Q4 and that's at $1.4 million or so for the year. Any color on Q4 and that's maybe the linearity of the quarter and then also maybe for Ray and congrats you're taking some time off here and then the cloud transition maybe any updates on that and how this incremental cost was kind of a dual sourcing right now as well if you can lay that out, thank you. Aman Bhutani : Hey Aaron, I'll take both of those and Mark you can chip something. When you look at Q4 customer growth, still seeing record type levels. The momentum has been good and momentum has carried on into January. So nothing different in the trajectory that we've been seen at point. With cloud you saw some of the impact of cloud in 2020, showing or manifesting itself in lower capital expenditures because we have continued to move workloads into the cloud, that is pressure on the second outline, that's one of the investments we're making there, but if you recall back when we signed our contract with AWS, we were going to manage this thing to a cash basis and that's what we are continuing to do and that's one of the reasons we use unlevered free cash flow as our key metric there because the balance from normalized EBITDA down there, obviously includes the CapEx versus the OpEx up in the P&L. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Zgutowicz from Rosenblatt Securities. Mark, please go ahead. Mark Zgutowicz : Thank you. Aman, just a follow-up on your freemium comment, is it safe to say that the 90-day conversion you hope to do, hope to improve upon and if so what potentially are the missing pieces there and point can help and then appreciate the commentary in your presentation highlighting returns on your marketing spend last year. Just curious how those compared to the prior year and as you look into '21 sort of what consideration you're making in terms of absolute or relative spend and how Poynt perhaps fits into that picture, thanks. Aman Bhutani : Thanks, let me take freemium and a little bit on the marketing spend and perhaps Ray wants to comment on that as well. On freemium, I actually go back to the comments Mark that in the prepared comments, what we're seeing in terms of conversion is a rate that's higher than what we've seen in the industry. So of course it's still early in the journey for us, but that's really good, that's really comforting, it's what's the concerns that people may have had. But when I look at being able to improve conversion over time, absolutely we have people dedicated to doing that, but for me, the biggest things is I want to get it out broader and broader and broader right. I'd like to have it at a 100% in the US soon. I'd like to go global with it and that's what I'm really pushing the team because we know that at the end of the day, it's about attracting more people to our products and getting them to use our products because once they use our products, people see that we have something differentiated offer that it works in a manner that they didn't fully understand that Go Daddy would have that offering. And then in terms of marketing, Ray can talk a little bit about the numbers and the unit economics and how we've continued to sort of maintain our benchmarks and wants to break even, but I'd like to give you a little context of how I think about and the marketing spend and the approach there is one of there you want to spend up in marketing and have you spend up you have to continually improve your measurement, your ability to get into more and more channels and as you do that and you improve your internal capabilities to market better, you can then spend even more in marketing and I've talked about sort of this idea of improvement in growth and improvement in spend in the path and it's something that I have experienced with and I am pretty pleased with what I'm seeing in terms of Go Daddy in 2020 and what we have forecasted for 2021. Ray Winborne : Yeah I think as you look at what we've been spending on marketing, it's roughly 13% of revenue in 2020, but it's discipline right. We're disciplined in approach, we're disciplined in the execution of delivering the P&L and the P&L we've got a really good track record of investing in marketing over time with good returns and the strong unit economics that we've got. And we've trend with the team to stretch and look at the next marginal customer at an acceptable return that is all about balance. But when we do see that, we extend to pay that period and that does create more risk or higher risk profile for us because it does hit the bottom line in the short term but for the right paybacks we are willing to do that. You might notice in those slides that we put out with the earnings, we've put a new slide in for marketing with a different lens on how we see the returns. So we'll take a look at that but in summary, we did roughly $0.85 in incremental bookings and $0.45 in incremental gross profit in 2020 for every dollar that we spent on marketing and advertising. So when you compare that against other in the industry, that's going to shape up pretty well. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Brent, please go ahead. UnidentifiedAnalyst: This is John on behalf of Brent Thill, thank you. When you look at the newer products, websites plus marketing and manage work risk, then when you think about what's the relative sizing in growth rate size you seem it's achievable? Aman Bhutani : I'll give you a kind of a view into those website creation of products last quarter with an ARR of $350 million growing in the high 30s. We've continued to see strong growth in both of those metrics. Unidentified Analyst : Is there a way to differentiate between the two if it's an indication between the core and DIY at all? Ray Winborne : Both are doing strongly. Obviously we've put a lot more shouldering the websites and marketing recently. You heard Aman's comments earlier. One of the things we would point that is going to help us there is continue to push on commerce which will stretch into the manage WordPress and ecommerce offering as well. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Naved Khan from Truist. Naved, please go ahead. Naved Khan : A couple of questions if I may. In terms of just your outlook, what are you baking in, in terms of potential synergies from points integration maybe later on in the year into your e-commerce packages and then another question just guidance related as well, how should we think about the drag from the social and outbound for this year? Is it material if it is and can you just call it out, thanks. Aman Bhutani : When you think about point synergies, we gave you guys some guidance around the top line and the bottom line. There is going to be investment year for Poynt. As we integrated into our offering we'll be spending money on marketing, spending money on product as well as experimenting across the front side of that. So that will be dilutive to the tune of $20 million in '21. On Social, think about that being ahead went through the first half and less so in the back, post our decision to pick up the outbound calling motion. So first quarter will be the highest headwind and then it starts to diminish as we move through the back half. Naved Khan : And then maybe just a quick clarification on the synergy comment Ray, so the curve you kind of gave us at the time of acquisition I think it's around $150 million in bookings by 2023. Should we expect any kind of revenue synergies to emerge this year at all or not? Ray Winborne : Yeah, you'll see some. This year is going to be a lot more focused on getting to market right. Payments will be first, but it's certainly not going to be linear. Next year 2022 will be more of the go to market strategy starting to drive revenue and then our expectation is we'll start to scale in three and that number that we put out sort of 150 in '23 should be a conservative number based off of what we're looking at. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] from Piper Sandler. Cart [ph] please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : This is Cart on for Brent. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to circle back to domain growth 14% another quarter of acceleration. I just wanted to dig in there, what is driving that growth? Is that all primary markets and if so, I see the dott.com and dot.net registration came down in Q4 but still at elevated levels. I guess what has given you the confidence from that guidance as double-digit growth for domain in 2021 and will there be any contribution from the new products for corporate domains or anything like that, that will be an offset. Ray Winborne : Yeah we're really pleased with the pleased with the performance in domains closing out 2020 with really solid growth and then obviously you saw the guide into 2021 continuing to see good strength and it is broad-based. That's the beauty of that business. Aman mentioned earlier, we own the dream phase of the customer journey. So it's strength across primary registrations. Renewals have been strong. We got aftermarket that is really doing well as we continue to improve the customer experience, but also the merchandising on front of site and in last, there is a modest contribution registry that I mentioned earlier roughly half a point on total revenue in 2021. Unidentified Analyst : And now that point is closed, I was wondering if you could frame the journey that for that company to come to payment facility you're in? How much of the offering the payment solution versus a third party profits and will you aggressive move to the internal solution for digital only commerce? Aman Bhutani : Yeah when we look at Poynt, obviously Poynt today has go to market strategy that's through a distribution channel, but when you see Poynt and Go Daddy together, obviously with Go Daddy's brand and 21 million customers and lots of folks being attracted to us with websites plus marketing, manage WordPress, which includes commerce on both sides, what we're excited about is bringing those pieces together and using the capabilities Go Daddy has and we have multiple capabilities to that. We have the opportunity to go direct to customer right because people know Go Daddy, they come into the sales path, they notice that the capabilities of there and it's seamless, it's integrated that works super well. We also work like I said with 1.5 million designers and developers right as we make the WooCommerce and WordPress ecosystems easier for them to you and we integrate these capabilities of payments and others into that experience, we think there's a great channel there for us to work with customers that we already have that work with other folks and give them the right incentives to sort of continue to fuel that pipeline. And then we always have Care right. We continue to have folks that call us, message us and although again we believe less in the outbound motion. So we're not talking about doing that but we do have a huge amount of inbound coming to us and that will continue to be a avenue for growth for us as well. So the incremental effort, the investment that we're putting in here, we think it's fantastic right and in terms of I think your question about using our internal systems, Poynt is already a payment facilitator. So we will be doing this ourselves right. It will not be -- that part will not be with a third-party. Christie Masoner :  [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Ygal Arounian. Ygal, please go ahead again. Ygal Arounian : Hey thanks for taking one more. I wanted to come back to commerce and just ask with the Poynt acquisition maybe with some of what you're doing around Pro Hub and the greater focus just around commerce over the past yearend and into next year, you guys have always talked about your core customer as being the micro business. Does this change that at all or is it still kind of the same type of business, but those that are more focused on commerce and where you see what's becoming mid-level crowded but at least a more crowded commerce software arena? Where do you guys see yourselves competing the most? Aman Bhutani : Yeah Ygal, we are still laser focused on our customer segment. These are the micro businesses or the small of the small businesses folks that have 20 employees or less, 10 employees or less and in 2020 they have had to pivot online very, very quickly. I need to explain that I think you guys know that very, very well, but let me tell you just a small story. We did a -- we have a customer in the UK, they make vegan pies and the place is called Magpie and they just have a fantastic product and we got to know them, we love the folks that run Magpie and our marketing team decided to have to showcase them in one of our marketing campaign just to check out the ad, it's phenomenal. Well, here was what I imagine was a local place where people in the same neighborhood probably came to them and bought pies from them. Well, the day they went live in our advertising now they're shipping pies all over the UK right. By definition they are now a company that is online and we think that opportunity exists for every micro business, right. The Internet is the great equalizer. It allows customers to reach these micro businesses and with the toolset with the guidance we offer in Care, these micro businesses can absolutely provide the experience to their customers that is professional, that does the job in a manner that leaves their customer's impressed. So to your question, we focus on our customer segment, absolutely we're building all our products roundup for those customers and all those customers are going online. In our research, they clearly show that they want commerce and they want it online because anyone of them can be like Magpie. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of James [ph]. James please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hey guys, this is actually Trevor on from the Barclays team. You're hosting in presence guidance for the full-year is high single digit while 1Q is mid-single-digit implying acceleration throughout the year. Is that just a matter of the tougher comp in 1Q or the updating impact from social and outbound as the year progresses, thanks? Ray Winborne : You answered your own question there exactly that, it's last year pre COVID, Social was growing and then second quarter, we started seeing the impact and then obviously beginning in the early July, we took out the outbound calling. So that's the progression you'll see as you move through 2021, but the implication in that guide was that we will see high single digits in that line. Unidentified Analyst : So could you exit the year at double-digit rates? Ray Winborne : Yes. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Kuntarich from Deutsche Bank. Chris, please go ahead. Chris Kuntarich : Just going back to the question before last, you talked about really how you guy's core focus is still on the businesses with 10 to 20 employees the micro-SMB segment. How do you think about driving more value in the product to the lower end specifically on the e-commerce product side versus driving value at the higher end just through the lens of websites plus marketing subscriptions? How do you think about driving pricing leverage and value to those customers differently that is, thanks? Aman Bhutani : Yeah Chris, these customers, we can definitely differentiate certain items and say look here are certain features that are better for these customers create more value and we have tears that different customers can talk, but I'd like to just bring it back to the idea that most of these customers are going online and doing commerce online in a significant way for the first time. Even the base set of features they need those to be super simple and what they really need is when they're confused to call someone and to get it to work just the way they want it. We've given the example in the past and I'll share a little bit of an update on it. We talked about how for the super small customers, the templates that create a one page commerce site when we created the first one, it just took off. It became the biggest thing right. We've now added more template and we find all of our customers going towards those templates because even I hate to call them bigger customers, but even customers that have 20 employees are learning their way through e-commerce and immediately they want to set the things where they're having trouble managing their inventory and they're calling us. They're having trouble taking what they're doing in the store to online and they need help and we're there or they want to manage between their online in-store and what they're selling on the major platforms and if that feedback that we're talking, we think okay, clearly these customers need the same thing which is they want from one place to be able to sell in their store, sell on their website and sell on any platform and hence you saw the Poynt acquisition us bringing together websites plus marketing, celebrate that we already own and the Poynt capabilities because we know that it works across the spectrum of customers we have and it's not really about truly separating out the value of sort of the top end of that or the bottom end of that. Christie Masoner : Thank you, everyone for joining us today. I'll turn the call over to Aman for some closing remarks. Aman Bhutani : Thank you, Christie. I'll just end with a thank you to all Go Daddy employees all around the world. 2020 brought many challenges for many of us at a personal level and I feel like every person leaned in to produce these fantastic results. Thank you all again for joining us and I look forward to talking to you next quarter. Christie Masoner : Good bye.",

With that, here\u2019s Aman. Aman Bhutani : Thank you, Mark, and thank you all for joining us today. GoDaddy exists to empower Everyday Entrepreneurs. We remain committed to a vision that can change the world, and radically shift the global economy in favor of small business. The internet has emerged as the greatest technological equalizer and every day more entrepreneurs are seizing that promised opportunity and making their own way. And we are thrilled to support them in their journey. Today, we are also pleased to announce that Michele Lau and Mark McCaffrey will be joining GoDaddy as our new Chief Legal Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively. As we charge down the path of growth, Michele and Mark bring scale and experience to our already strong leadership team. Michele joins us from McKesson where she advises its board and senior executives on strategic matters related to M&A, corporate strategy, executive compensation, corporate governance, the McKesson Foundation and so much more. She co-chairs the National Asian Pacific Bar Association\u2019s In-House Counsel Mentoring Program and serves on the board of directors of the Asian Pacific Fund. Michele is talented and humble, experienced and curious, a strong cultural fit and will no doubt take us to the next level. Mark joins us from PWC where he led the U.S. Technology, Media, and Telecom Sector. Mark is a visionary, and a strategic leader who has developed a breadth of expertise, not just in finance, but across all of software and technology. He is a thought leader in the industry, and brings the depth of understanding that GoDaddy needs to wisely invest and drive growth.  One of the things that appealed to me about Mark is that he has been a strategic partner, directly advising CEOs and CFOs of the world\u2019s greatest tech companies, through important transitions. We are confident that Mark will be a fantastic addition to the strategic leadership of the company and together we will do great things. We wanted to take this opportunity to introduce Mark to you, here\u2019s Mark Mark McCaffrey : Thanks, Aman. I'm very excited to be here today. GoDaddy has an incredible history of empowering small businesses and delivering great value for its customers. I was obviously attracted to the vision and mission of the company to radically change the global economy in favor of small businesses, but there is so much more to it.  The more I learned about Aman\u2019s strategic vision, the more I wanted to be a part of what\u2019s coming next on this journey. I\u2019m thrilled to be joining such an accomplished leadership team, and even more excited about what we\u2019re going to build in the future. I\u2019m anxious to dive in, and I look forward to meeting with many you on this call in the coming months. Aman Bhutani : Thank you, Mark. Both Michele and Mark have connected very well with the existing leadership team and it is going to be fun working with them. We are grateful to have been in the position where a broad and diverse set of candidates were attracted to the GoDaddy story, and true to our commitment to velocity, we moved quickly and with purpose to fill the large shoes our existing leaders are leaving behind. Talking about moving quickly, our customers move quickly too. Our core focus has been about accelerating the velocity of innovation at GoDaddy. Ambitious goals and big ideas supported by operational discipline in the form of experimentation, both large and small. Last quarter I talked about three priorities for the year : Commerce, powered by our growth in presence, our focus on Pros and our domains business. With four consecutive quarters of accelerating bookings growth, today, I\u2019m delighted to share that in the last few months we brought to market new capabilities in all three of our priorities. Our top priority this year from a product perspective is commerce. As more and more of our customers are coming online with the explicit intent to sell products and services, we are rapidly innovating to meet those needs. Following our acquisition of Poynt in February, we have hit the ground running. We are live in market with payments functionality for WordPress and a beta launch of a seamless payments experience in websites plus marketing is coming in a few weeks. And our teams are running in parallel getting payments to market while continuing to make significant progress towards our true end goal, a holistic, omni-commerce solution, purpose-built by GoDaddy for the Everyday Entrepreneur to be launched this year. While we plan these significant improvements, our customers continue to succeed on our platform with GMV for websites plus marketing and Sellbrite growing 100% year-over-year in Q1. Websites plus marketing commerce subscriptions also continue to stand out, increasing more than 70% year-over-year demonstrating the preference of our customers for our seamless and intuitive experience. We continue to see strong growth in websites plus marketing overall. Our customers look to us for help attracting their customers to effectively market their products and services. The plus marketing side of the suite is critical for customers, and I wanted to share four incredible new features to help our customers do exactly that, and do it in a simple way : First, we\u2019re excited to announce the launch of Facebook 'Boosted Posts', empowering GoDaddy customers to create and manage simple advertising campaigns on Facebook from within websites plus marketing. Our seamless and intuitive experience eliminates duplicated effort for our customers, and we take it further for them. With one click, our customers can turn their social media posts into email marketing campaigns. Second, through direct API integration with Instagram, GoDaddy customers can create, edit, post, and engage on Instagram directly from their websites plus marketing dashboard. Customers love this capability and we saw a 63% increase in account connections, and a 22% increase in weekly social posts after we introduced this feature. Third, we have a lot of service-based customers, like personal trainers or accountants, and they have unique needs. We launched a new Online Appointments Social Composer, which enables them to create posts to market their business and drive appointment bookings on their website through their social media channels. The result? Customers who used the social composer saw an average order per site and an average GMV per site increase by 20%. Last but not least, our brand is built on guidance and we have been working hard to bring guidance online. Recently, we embedded guidance directly into the editor. This personalized action plan leverages data from millions of websites and provides our customers with their next best action. About 20% percent of websites plus marketing customers have already engaged with this tool, and we saw an 86% increase in publication rates among those that did. Websites plus marketing has grown into a suite of products with capabilities that help customers succeed in all digital channels. We continue to get the product out to as many customers as possible with freemium, with marketing dollars and customers consistently tell us they want more. Moving to our second priority, Pros, we're pleased to share that last week, we hosted Expand 2021, our first ever conference for web designers and developers, or GoDaddy Pros. We created Expand to bring together the Pro community and share best practices and tools that will help them scale their business, get work done more efficiently, and keep clients happy.  We had thousands of Pros sign up for the event and early feedback is they absolutely loved it. Pros prefer the WordPress platform, and its success is clear from its market share gains. GoDaddy is committed to our Pros and to WordPress. We have a lot to offer Pros and I wanted to highlight a couple of recent releases : The first is the public beta launch of a new WordPress editor, optimized for ease-of-use and simplicity, making site building in WordPress easier than ever. We've been rolling out the new editor to new users quickly over the last couple of months. About half of the new users globally are now starting with the new editor and early indication is that their level of satisfaction is nicely higher than customers using the regular WordPress editor. The second is the Pro Hub. We talked about the launch of the Hub last quarter and now thousands of Pros are using it and using it frequently. Our target is to have over 300,000 pros enrolled and actively using the Hub by the end of the year. This is unique functionality for Pros, available for free, and every week the team launches new features and capabilities. The opportunity with Pros is huge. We're putting initiatives in place that will help us drive value for this important customer segment for many years. And, we're equally excited about the value created for GoDaddy and its shareholders as we tap more meaningfully into this market.  Moving onto Domains, last quarter I shared with you the acceleration of velocity we are seeing in experimentation in our Domains business and the innovation it is driving for our customers. The acceleration is a function of focusing on the customer needs, and when we provide customers with better products, they reward us with high engagement with our products, and higher revenue. It started showing up in our numbers meaningfully last quarter, and accelerated in Q1. The result in domains demonstrates the opportunities that exist for GoDaddy even in its most mature business. We are a two-sided marketplace for Domains, independent customers on one side and domain investors on the other. The high-teens growth in Domains is driven by innovation on connecting these customers and we will continue to innovate to drive these high levels of growth. I wanted to share a couple of examples of this with you : We created new experiences for Domain Investors that allowed them to quickly do bulk searches and orders. That simplified the day-to-day experiences for them. As domain investors engaged more, they added domains into the aftermarket, which we then pulled into new search experiences for independents, so they could have access to more inventory and find the right name for their venture. We also did the reverse; we gave independent customers an easy way to list their domain name in the aftermarket, a way that was seamless and custom-built for them. Independent customers added over 200,000 domain names that had otherwise been passive, into the aftermarket, spurring activity for Domain Investors. Creating these types of loops can quickly accelerate, and our team is reviewing every experience from basic parking to deep learning models, and testing improvements that add value to the customer and spur network effects. One such opportunity that we will bring to bear is with our GoDaddy Registry business. A few weeks ago, we announced some small acquisitions, with big aspirations. We're adding about 30 new TLDs to GoDaddy Registry, including .club, .design, and the MMX portfolio. The efficiencies of scale make obvious sense and the reason for us to scale GoDaddy Registry is to be able to innovate for our customers. Following the acquisitions that we\u2019ve announced, GoDaddy will be the third-largest registry in the world, and our platform allows us to add TLDs at near-zero incremental cost. The high-margin business gives us investment dollars, while keeping costs low. This is key to us creating new experiences for customers, while giving them a choice of the best TLDs, both from our partners and from GoDaddy. In closing, as we have shared in the past, our formula for success, first and foremost, is about creating value for our customers. Our operating velocity is about innovation driving a constant increase in customer value allowing us to shift part of the value to shareholders. GoDaddy had a strong quarter, powered by a good acceleration in bookings. And yes, our strong business model showed up, and yes, we flexed our organic and inorganic muscles for growth, and yes, we invested in our products and marketing while delivering healthy unlevered free cash flow, but the key to long-term growth and value creation remains that we are a customer-led software company focused on innovation for our customers, and our customers continue to want to do more with us. With that, let's hear from Ray now, in what will be his last quarterly call for GoDaddy. Thank you, Ray. Ray Winborne : Thanks Aman, I\u2019ll touch on the financial results for what was a terrific quarter for GoDaddy, and then provide our outlook for Q2 and the rest of the year. Q1 is another solid proof point validating the strategy we laid out last year at our Investor Day. We've now seen four consecutive quarters of accelerating bookings growth, and the teams are pushing harder every day to increase velocity in innovation, giving us confidence we're just beginning to tap the huge opportunity in front of us. For the quarter, total revenue came in at $901 million, growing over 14% year-over-year, while currency impacts were negligible. Our international business grew 16% on a reported basis. That\u2019s the fastest growth in over two years as we see ever increasing demand for digital presence in markets around the world. Business applications was our fastest growing product line, increasing 21% year-over-year on continued strength in branded email and productivity solutions. And, Domains was not far behind, growing 19% on the heels of the experimentation efforts Aman talked about earlier. We continue to see stellar growth in aftermarket domain sales. With over 20 million domains listed, GoDaddy operates the largest and most active domain aftermarket in the world, and it now contributes roughly 10% of total revenue. We also continue to see great strength in primary domain registrations and strong product renewal rates. And finally, hosting and presence grew little over 4% in the first quarter. This line continues to reflect headwinds from the GoDaddy social product due to the elimination of the outbound sales motion last June. Putting some context on that impact, excluding GoDaddy social, from both periods, growth in hosting and presence would have been high-single digits this quarter. We marked a major milestone from the scale perspective this quarter. For the first time ever, GoDaddy is reporting quarterly bookings of more than a billion dollars. Bookings rose 14% year-over-year with a point of currency tailwind. Strength was broad-based across products and geographies, with domains seeing the most upside. Gross margin came in at 64% in the quarter. As we've shared with you in the past, there are many variables that can impact gross margin in any given quarter, but product mix is one of the most important. Outsized growth in domains impacted overall gross margins this quarter, but we remain within the mid-60s range we've always pointed to. More importantly, we're pleased with the growth in gross profit dollars generated by the top line out performance this quarter. Both G&A and tech and dev expenses accelerated this quarter, primarily related to acquisition expenses pre and post-consolidation. Importantly, our acquisition of Poynt in February required us to account for some of the acquisition price as GAAP operating expenses, which we call out in the reconciliation tables in the press release and slides.  Excluding these non-recurring expenses, tech and dev expense would have been lower by $29 million, but still up nearly 20% year-over-year, as we press to accelerate product development. We also continued to invest in marketing to capture strong demand in the market. The net sum resulted in normalized EBITDA of $192 million in Q1, representing growth of 17%. Moving to cash flow, unlevered free cash flow for the quarter was $268 million, growing 14%, partially from lighter CapEx spend this quarter that should even itself out over the remainder of the year. Now, onto the balance sheet. We finished Q1 with $1.3 billion in cash and total liquidity of nearly $1.9 billion. In February, we issued $800 million eight-year senior unsecured notes with a fixed rate of 3.5% to fund acquisition activity. We also took advantage of favorable market conditions, repricing the 2027 term loan lowering the rate by 50 basis points and generating nearly $4 million in annual cash savings. Net debt stands at $2.7 billion, below 3 times net leverage on a trailing 12-month basis, and near the mid-point of our targeted range of 2 times to 4 times. And we have no significant debt maturities until 2024. Additionally, we repurchased 3.5 million shares of our common stock through today, for an aggregate purchase price of $276 million or an average price of just under $79 per share. These repurchases represent approximately 2% reduction in fully diluted shares outstanding. We also announced that our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization to acquire an incremental $775 million of our common stock, bringing the total repurchase capacity to $1 billion. GoDaddy has a highly resilient, recurring revenue model, and a strong balance sheet. This enables us to execute against a number of priorities as you saw this quarter, including investing for organic growth, acquisitions, and share repurchases. We remain confident that we have the liquidity and flexibility to pursue multiple capital allocation priorities in pursuit of long-term growth and free cash flow per share. With that, let's turn to our outlook. Given the strong pacing of the business, we\u2019re raising our guidance for full-year revenue to $3.75 billion, or 13% growth, and we're also raising the outlook for unlevered free cash flow to $955 million or 16% growth. With respect to investment cadence, we're seeing good returns on marketing spend, and plan to continue at similar levels of investment to drive growth. We also expect continued tech and dev investment as we push on the velocity and scope of our product development, including the launch of an omni-commerce offering. These investments will be largely offset by the operating leverage we're seeing in customer care and G&A. For Q2, we expect total revenue of approximately $920 million, or 14% growth year-over-year, with high-teens growth in domains and business applications, and high-single-digit growth in hosting and presence. Note that this updated guidance reflects $20 million of revenue and $20 million of unlevered free cash flow dilution from the Poynt acquisition and does not incorporate the impact of any of the recently announced registry deals. We continue to expect Poynt to contribute more than $150 million in incremental bookings to our commerce solution in 2023. In closing, 2021 has been strong out of the gate, exceeding our expectations and we\u2019re not done yet. We\u2019re playing offense in a world where a digital presence is now table stakes and commerce continues to evolve quickly. GoDaddy will lead in this space by providing differentiated customer experiences, growth opportunities for its employees and creating significant value for shareholders. With that, well Christie Masoner from our IR team open up the call for questions. A- Christie Masoner : Thanks, Ray. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from J.P. Morgan. Sterling, please go ahead. Sterling Auty : All right, great, can you hear me, okay. Christie Masoner : We can. Sterling Auty : All right. Ray, congratulations on finishing up your tenure at GoDaddy on such a high note, but I am wondering how happy Mark is with you raising guidance before you step-out the door? Ray Winborne : Thanks Sterling. Appreciate it. It was a fantastic quarter. Happy with where the business is \u2013 the trajectory of it. Sterling Auty : So maybe you can help us out a couple of fronts. I think maybe the one that is still drilling in, you mentioned the headwinds and hosting and presence, when did those headwinds abate? And where logically should the growth in that business go? As it kind of gets back to a more normalized run rate? Ray Winborne : Yeah, thanks for that question Sterling. It's one we get pretty commonly. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, ex-social, the hosting and presence line grew in the high-single-digits in the first quarter. And the guide on a forward basis is continued growth in that range, rest of the year obviously implies an acceleration as you move through. Gosh we've been super happy with what we're seeing in those subscription software products that we've talked about. And we really did start to see continued strong growth there. Aman highlighted a lot of the progress we're seeing from a commerce perspective. So, there's upside from here. The fact remains that traditional hosting and security products still make up a large percentage of that line item. I think the thing as an investor, we should look at and remember is that these products are critical to the success of our partner audience, right, who serve entrepreneurs. And while they're a little slower growing, they are super stable businesses, their cash generative, and they support the investments we\u2019re making in those software centric offerings like websites plus market, manage WordPress, over [sell bright] and now with the introduction of omni-commerce later this year. All those investments are being funded by us and the create and grow phase of the customer journey, we've highlighted this, you've seen in the investor deck, right? That's $175 billion TAM, huge opportunity for us. As these offerings continue to scale, we add capabilities. We do expect that to be a tailwind to the hosting and presence growth as we move forward. Sterling Auty : That makes sense. And then maybe one follow up on the domain side, with the new mix with the registry operations in there, no longer does this look like a segment that's going to grow in-line with customer growth the way that it's been articulated in the past? How should we think about the sustainability of what type of growth rate and domains as we move forward? Aman Bhutani : Hey, Sterling, this is Aman. Maybe I'll start and Ray can jump in. You know, the story here and of course, there's, you know, growth from the primary market, we're seeing sort of new demand customers coming in, but the outsized growth in the aftermarket as well, and there's good demand there. But the real story here is about innovation, right? We want to increase the pace of innovation at the company, we've put that energy into the domain side, and you're seeing the results of that, you know, as we continue to improve the product, we've seen more inventory, basically more domains going to the aftermarket. And on both sides, independence and domain investors, sort of taking advantage of that. You know, our view is that we'll continue to innovate, to look for opportunities, sort of on every [road], to improve the customer experience. And, you know, the innovation will continue to drive growth for the company. You know, in terms of sustainability, you know, we like to think that we're making changes that make the growth durable, but of course, you know, as we've said, before, that we started to see some goodness in Q4 of last year. So, we're going to have to continue to innovate to sort of continue to drive growth. So, I'll turn it to Ray to add a bit more color. Ray Winborne : Yeah, just adding a little bit to that, Sterling. You could think of the driver of that 5 points or sequential acceleration in the domains line item as being a lot of the aftermarket, right. So, Aman mentioned and we feel good about the systemic changes we're making in the product in the flows. So, we do expect the dollars to continue to drive meaningful growth as we move forward. That said, we do anticipate the domains growth rates to moderate to the, you know, low-double digits rate by the end of the year. Sterling Auty : Understood. Thank you. Ray Winborne : You bet. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of [Jan Lee] from Evercore ISI. [Jan], please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you guys and congrats on the quarter. So, this is Jan for Mark Mahaney. I guess maybe \u2013 one more question on websites and marketing, if you could put some color around just the overall web and marketing growth compared to prior quarters as the revenue base for W plus M plus continues to work to grow. And also like, what's the cadence of the freemium rollout? Where are we in terms of like the U.S. rolled out? And if you could put some color on the conversion? Aman Bhutani : Yeah, let me take the last bit of that first, this is Aman, Jan. In terms of the freemium rollout, we continue to be super happy with the rollout. Majority of customers in the U.S. are now seeing the freemium product. We are still gathering the last bits of data on it, but we are satisfied from a conversion standpoint that it is doing better than free trial, and it's going to be the way forward for us. Our path there, the next steps there will be about taking freemium into other English speaking markets, and then our other international markets. So that's, sort of the roadmap for freemium moving forward. And in terms of the comparison, year-over-years, I\u2019ll turn it to Ray. Ray Winborne : Yeah, Jan. The rates on those products, the growth rates are consistent with what we've been talking about in recent quarters continue to be really happy with both attach we're seeing there, as well as the skews that folks are choosing. Unidentified Analyst : And if I may add one more question on just the Poynt, going out a couple of years, I know you talked about, you know, 150 million by 2023, what kind of assumptions are you using in terms of just the GMV capture? How much of that GMV do you expect to be flowing through Poynt at that time? Ray Winborne : That's it. Those are conservative, right. I don\u2019t want to get into the details yet, because we're still a good ways out from actually launching that iterating on the go to market, whether it's new versus existing. So, there's going to be a lot of factors to consider as we roll that product out. But 150 is the minimum we're looking at. We think there's a lot more opportunity beyond that. Unidentified Analyst : Great, thank you guys. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Nick Jones from Citi. Nick, please go ahead. Nick Jones : Great, thanks for taking the questions. I guess first, could you just maybe give an update on quarter-to-date trends as kind of COVID concerns and uncertainty persists? And then the second question is maybe bigger picture, is roll-out new features for social API integrations with Instagram, things like that? What is the level of the, kind of the current sub base awareness of these roll-outs that are, you know, pretty frequent? And then, you know, how does this come into play with winning new subs who are in market to choose a platform and maybe in particular, the e-commerce solutions at GoDaddy? Thanks. Ray Winborne : Hey, Nick, let me take the first one and then Aman can hit on the product. As far as trajectory, we continue to see really strong year-over-year growth in new customer cohorts. That\u2019s both in the number of customers and in the absolute dollar value of the cohort. If you look at the first quarter cohort, you know, it's comparable to what the size is, we were seeing the Q2, Q3 last year, when the COVID demand surged. You know, we are seeing differences in demand around the world, just like we have for the last year, but the numbers are still really strong, as you can see in the results and in the guide. And this is consistent with what you're seeing in a lot of the other external data points with respect to small businesses, including, you know, instilling real robust new business formation in the U.S., in particular. The Q2 guide that we put out there, as well as the full-year, you know, is what we see with respect to current trajectory. Aman Bhutani : And then, in terms of the feature set, Nick, you know, it's all about very, very quickly bringing features to market that create value for customers, that increases their engagement, that increases their customer success, right. That drives awareness \u2013 that success for them drives sort of the awareness of the product, not just with them, but with other people. And you know, the beautiful word of mouth that continues there.  But internally, what it does is that customer success leads to us being able to build an ecosystem of upsell, be able to build an ecosystem where they're able to adopt new and new capability, and we're able to offer them more. And then we're able to bring that success to, sort of earlier in the sales path where we can use that messaging in terms of confidence to say, you know, ex-percent of customers are using this, you should try to, you can get it with this starter package of websites plus marketing. Hopefully, that answers a little bit of, I think, the question that you were asking. And there's just a ton of opportunity for us to drive awareness about our product, you know, I look at a lot of research where customers are just surprised to see how simple and intuitive and kind of powerful websites plus marketing is for their needs, but they just didn't know that it existed or that it did [X, Y, Z] and us continuing to launch those features, you know, just makes it very, very big.  And then quick mention on the Pro side, you know, this is why we did the expand program. You know, we have a new editor in play for WordPress, we've launched the hub. And we've got to get word out there that GoDaddy is bringing to the table new feature set functionality, you know, a huge amount of it for free, that can really make life easier for the Pros. And you know, so far they're liking what they're seeing. Nick Jones : Great. Thank you. Christie Masoner : The next question comes from the line of Trevor Young from Barclays. Trevor, please go ahead. Trevor Young : Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Can you comment on how you think you can monetize the boosted posts for Facebook, as well as the Instagram API, and do you have any of preliminary stats on customer adoption? And then Aman, you had noted targeting, I think 300,000 Pros enrolled in pro hub by year-end, that's probably about 20% penetration. Where do we stand today, knowing that it's, you know, still very early days? And just what's going to drive that, you know, adoption? Thanks. Aman Bhutani : Yeah, it's super early days. And, you know, I've mentioned a couple of metrics for some of the features, you know, where we have a little bit more data, and no doubt for things like boosted posts, and others. We'll see, I think, really, really good engagement from our customers on those. In terms of engagement with the hub, the 300,000 number comes from looking at our basic customers, as you know we have 1.5 million Pros on our platform, which is just a massive number. But to engage them at a much deeper level, you know our \u2013 what we did is we segmented those customers.  And we said, look, here are the types of sub segments within those that could really benefit from a tool like the hub, and those are the customers we're targeting, you're going to see us, sort of reach out to them with sort of innovative marketing solutions, that bring them to the hub that allow them to try tools and then sort of add value to it every week, literally every week, every other week we put something out there.  So that, you know, if you go to the hub today, for example, you know, one of the things we have out there is more data for them for their websites that we're capturing, and you'll see some data set, and then you'll see right in front of it coming soon, you know, on the next thing. So that they, they feel that the velocity of change that they feel that, okay, I'm seeing this today, and I'm going to have something in a week or two, and I need to come back together. So that that's the type of loop we're trying to create to bring 300,000 folks into the hub. Ray Winborne : Hey, Trevor, when you think about monetization on those websites plus marketing capabilities, right, we're focused on delivering that customer value first, then we'll get to monetization once we've gotten that closer to scale. Trevor Young : Great, thank you both and congrats Ray on leaving on a strong mark. Ray Winborne : I appreciate it. Christie Masoner : The next question comes from the line of Ron Josey from JMP Securities. Ron, please go ahead. Ron Josey : Great, thanks for taking the question. Always good to talk to you. So, I wanted to ask maybe two on, Aman on payments and the commerce solution, you know, you talked about getting both ready to market, I guess payment trading market and the end goal the omni-commerce solution launching here. Websites and marketing commerce, I think subscriptions or subs rose 70% year-over-year. And so can you talk to us maybe how GoDaddy looks once these solutions are fully launched and really what we can expect around building awareness given your commentary of new products and services are being launched. But awareness is still something that's being worked on? And then maybe another question more just on the organization, with things reopening now, are the [guides] back in the office and just wondering how the organization if folks are back in the office, how that's coming along from just an efficiency perspective? Thank you. Aman Bhutani : Yeah, happy to take that. On the payments piece, you know, we have a WordPress solution out there. That's a small start, because we're trying to see, you know how things work and push through things through the pipe. But the big launch, as you said, you know, is about websites plus marketing and having a completely seamless experience. The way I'd want you to visualize that is, you know, customer comes to us, they start with a website or a domain, ultimately they have an online, store online. And as they're picking their payments provider, they have a clean default choice that says, you know, started with GoDaddy payments. And it just works seamlessly every interface they go into looks the same, feels the same, works the same way, is connected in the background.  So, they are not copy pasting anything, you know, everything related to their, sort of selling capability, whether it's in, you know, it's on their side or with partners like Amazon, or Etsy or others is handled seamlessly and just taken care of. And of course, the omni-commerce solution, which we're committed to launching this year, is about bringing the capability of in-store into that same ecosystem as well. You know, outside of that, we're also targeting managed WordPress, which is our instance of WordPress and GoDaddy payment solution for managed WordPress, which we will also be launching in a few weeks. You know, as we put those pieces together, the point about awareness, of course, continues to become bigger and bigger. But once we have a full solution, we can actually go to market in a different way.  We can actually go to market and talk to customers about having the full capability of them being able to do it in the manner that they like to do it with GoDaddy, where the solutions are simple, the technology is intuitive, and the human guidance is always, always available to them. So that's what you should expect from us. In terms of reopening, we are still evaluating reopening, you know like many other companies, we have done some surveys of the employee base, we have put in some dates where, you know, we're going to incur what \u2013 ask folks to come in on a volunteer basis.  And so far, there's not a lot of folks taking us up on that. I think folks continue to be concerned. I think, folks, in many places \u2013 and it depends on country, as you well know, obviously the situation in India, very, very difficult right now, but depending on country, you know, there are some locations where people are slightly more open to it. But at this point, we think it's looking more like later in the summer that we'll have a set of folks back in the office. Ron Josey : And maybe from a productivity perspective, we\u2019re now a year, call it three quarters in of the guides working from home. Maybe improvements there. Thank you. Aman Bhutani : Yeah, you know, we're happy with the productivity that we've continued to add more sort of tech, we've continued to add more capability for the guides to work remotely because we realize that this is, sort of a new normal for quite a bit. So far, we're pretty happy with the productivity. We start to lap some of that, you know, going into April and May here. So, so far, we're pretty happy with it. Ron Josey : Got it. Thank you. Aman Bhutani : Thank you. Christie Masoner : The next question comes from Brent Bracelin from Piper Sandler & Co. Brent, please go ahead. Clarke Jeffries : Hi. This is Clarke Jeffries on for Brent. First question, certainly top of mind is that 19% domain\u2019s growth number, highest in three years with a high teens guide. And Ray, I appreciate the disclosure around percentage of the business from aftermarket. Could you maybe give us a sense of what percentage of the business aftermarket was a year ago or in the past? And maybe how much volumes versus ASPs are driving the benefit today? And I have one follow-up. Thanks. Ray Winborne : Yeah, Clarke, yeah, we've been disclosing for a while at single-digit. And now it's climbed up to double-digit, we've been really happy with all the work the team's been putting in place and Aman articulated a lot of the things we're doing. It's not just one thing. It's different purchase passes, it\u2019s different [UX] on it. And it's more inventory in the pipe. So, the lift there has been really strong. And you saw that 5 point difference on the sequential that you just talked about. From a unit versus ASP perspective, this is primarily unit, right. These are more inventory going through the pipe versus higher ASPs. Now, we do see our share of strong ASPs, you know, six digit plus numbers, but that's not what's driving the revenue growth. Clarke Jeffries : Alright, perfect. And then second question, you know, obviously strong global demand seen with 16% growth in international. But I was wondering if we could get a little bit more detail about where you're seeing strength in the different regions, any pockets of particular strength to call out? And then, is there any, you know, takeaway for investors, with this being a third of the business and now growing faster than overall revenue? Ray Winborne : Yeah, fantastic results out of the international team. They've really stepped up during the COVID demand surge, particularly in the marketing side. If you look at some of the campaigns that we put out there in different markets, it's really driving a lot of sign-ups. As far as any areas of strength, our developed markets are growing incredibly strong. So Canada, Australia, UK, India, those all sequentially stepped up. And we've been really happy with the results we're seeing there. Clarke Jeffries : Perfect. Thank you very much. Ray Winborne : You bet. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from Ygal Arounian from Wedbush. Ygal, please go ahead. Ygal Arounian : Hey, guys, thanks for taking the questions. So, I actually thought that one of the most important things you said on the call so far today is just that the cohorts, the 1Q cohort is comparable to 2Q and 3Q last year, and I think that's an incredibly positive sign. So, I wanted to dig into that a little bit. Maybe you could, if there's anything around core behavior, you know, where they're coming into the funnels at around domains. You know, is it more on the website sales marketing side? Is it manage WordPress, is the Pro push helping push that and some of those behaviors? So, just some color around that. And then, on the hosting side, I know, it's \u2013 there's lot of grown piece and not the fanciest part of the business, but remains important. Are there opportunities to grow that business? And are you seeing pressure there from the larger cloud providers taking share in the market? Or do you guys not really play in the same ballpark? Aman Bhutani : Ygal, thanks for the question. You know, on the cohorts, as Ray said, Q1 came in as a strong cohort, and definitely behaving similar to the Q2, Q3 cohorts, so, we \u2013 that he talked about. I think, overall, that's great customer numbers. They're coming in through similar channels. You know, as an example, you talked about Pros, you know the stuff we're talking about Pros is still early. So, what you are going to expect is the channels are pretty similar. And it's similar to what we saw through the pandemic last year. So, there isn't a lot of, sort of change in terms of the shape. It's just nice increase, continued nice increase in customer numbers, and just more going through the pipe. And then on the second piece, I'll let Ray take it. Ray Winborne : Yeah, Ygal, so as far as competition, right, there is some consolidation taking place in hosting, but we are very sharply priced on our offering. And the Pro hub is another way we're enhancing the benefit for those folks that are coming in and using that product. Ygal Arounian : Great and thanks for taking the questions. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe. Deepak, please go ahead. Deepak, please un-mute your line. We will move on to the next question coming from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Brent, please go ahead. Brent Thill : Ray. Congrats on a great run. Ray Winborne : Thanks, Brent. Brent Thill : When you think about the cash flow, it was about 11% ahead of the street. And I'm just curious, nice to see the commitment to the buyback, but also questions around, you know, you've done some great tuck-ins with Poynt and others, you know, your commitment on that side, too, and how you're going to balance the buyback versus overall tuck-ins to solidify their tech platform. Ray Winborne : You got a question there, Brent or are you making a comment? Brent Thill : No, I'm just curious when you think about the mix and how you're incorporating that, it was nice to see the commitment to the buyback. But I was just curious if you can comment, as it relates to M&A, and part of the strategy going forward. You've done some nice tuck-ins like Poynt, you know, should we continue to expect that going forward? How you think about capital allocation? Ray Winborne : Gosh, is the beauty of this business model, right. Significant and predictable cash flow generation, we can execute across all of the capital allocation priorities, right, whether that's organic M&A, and share repurchases. To your point, we've made a string of acquisitions over the last 18 months that have added significant product capability, some incredible talent, and some strategic optionality. When you think about registering that, virtualization there, you know, since the last earnings call, 2% of our outstanding equity at really attractive prices, because we were able to take advantage of the market volatility. And honestly, when you look at capital allocation for us, it's pretty easy where net leverage is near the midpoint leaves us a whole turn of EBITDA in capacity there. But those priorities in the order don't change, right. We're going to invest prudently, but at an accelerated rate in the organic business, M&A, we've got a strong pipeline, and it will continue to be opportunistic, with that billion dollars of capacity we've got on repurchases. Brent Thill : Okay, excellent. Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau from William Blair. Matt, please go ahead. Matt Pfau : Hey, thanks, guys. Just wanted to ask another question on the Pro hub product, maybe if my understanding is incorrect, but I think that it's free for professionals to sign up for the product and that you can actually use it to manage WordPress websites that aren't created on GoDaddy. So, maybe just, sort of be helpful if you could dig into the monetization model and strategy with the Pro hub? Aman Bhutani : Yes, for sure, Matt. So the approach here is very much aligned with our broader approach as a company. The idea is to build tools and capabilities that add value to the customer drive engagement, drive value, right, over time, take some of that value and shift it to shareholders, right. Absolutely the Pro hub is a fantastic tool that not only helps Pros come in and manage WordPress instances, you know, both hosted at GoDaddy and outside. But it also gives them a place where they can do a bit of project management or manage their clients. And we're adding more and more capabilities to it. The idea is to create value for the Pro. As an example, we already know that just the pros that are using it right now are saying that they can save about three hours per site rate per month, already with just what we have today. So, as we save those Pros time, we expect to have a bigger part of their business with GoDaddy. And it forms a great starting point for us to be able to put in front of them, you know, new capabilities, new products, because they have a high engagement product that they come to all the time that they \u2013 it creates value for them, and gives us the opportunity to now expose them to products that we monetize. Matt Pfau : Got it and just one follow-up on that, within your Pro base are you seeing, you know, similar uptake or interest in launching commerce sites that you're seeing in the websites plus marketing business? Aman Bhutani : I think we're very early in that space. We know that Pros are super interested in commerce, we know that WooCommerce supports a huge percentage of the online e-commerce sort of GMV today. So, we know there's great demand there. We know there's a strong community behind it. But we're still pretty early in that process. As you'll remember, in Q4, last year, we did an acquisition called SkyVerge, so we now have a team that is dedicated to WooCommerce. They're part of the overall commerce division, which as you know, is led by Osama Bedier, who joined us from Poynt. So, we're actually bringing all the different pieces together at the company and saying here's the commerce division they are going to deliver a platform that works across websites plus marketing and manage WordPress. Matt Pfau : Thanks, guys, appreciate it. Aman Bhutani : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Naved Khan from Truist. Naved, please go ahead. Naved Khan : Hi, thanks. Thanks for taking my question. Just curious to know if the 70% growth in the websites plus marketing and Sellbrite is comparable to what we have been seen in the last few quarters? Or is there is a pickup or about the same? And also maybe, if you can give some color on the mix of e-commerce packages within that that would be great? Aman Bhutani : Yeah, sorry, I can take that. Overall, you know, the growth we talked about was all commerce across, you know, websites plus marketing suite. So, that grew 70%, year-over-year and it's \u2013 if I remember right, well consistent with what we've talked about. We've consistently seen that skew grow, you know, faster than the other skews. And I think it matches the demand we have in the market today, right. Customers are coming online, they're looking for an online store, you also saw us shift, I think I talked about it in the previous call some of our merchandising, where you come to the homepage of GoDaddy, and unless we already know you and personalize it, what we put right in front of you is the ability to build an online store with websites plus marketing. In terms of the percentages, you know, going into the commerce skew versus others, broadly in line with what we've talked to you about, you know, it continues to be the product that customers are excited about. It continues to be the product that we're putting a lot in. And it's not just about product commerce, as I've talked in my prepared remarks. We're doing more and more first services commerce customers, as well. And their needs are unique and different. What they're looking for is tools that help them do the online appointment and sort of, you know things that go along with that. So, you know, overall, I would say the similar trend, but hopefully that little bit of color helps. Naved Khan : That's helpful. And maybe a quick follow up. On the payment front, at what point you think maybe you can start to maybe share some numbers that you know that you think you can be generating, either in the back half or maybe for 2022? And also, with respect to your own expectations, how are you tracking with the launch or integrating point into the online packages? Aman Bhutani : Yeah. We continue to be very happy with the Poynt integration, we're moving very aggressively the products that we're building and testing right now. And as I said, you know, we've got something out there for WordPress already. And you'll see more from us in websites plus marketing within a few weeks. You know, from my perspective, they\u2019ll look fantastic. It's exactly, sort of seamless, intuitive experience that our customer base needs and we're absolutely excited about providing that.  We're still on track to provide an omni-commerce solution. This year, our teams are working in parallel and burning the [midnight] on that, you know, we're all super excited about it. We think it's going to make a difference in the market. And bringing, sort of in-store, online, and platforms, Amazon, Etsy, all of those sales together in one place bundled with commerce, with payments, and honestly more opportunities coming right behind the invoicing and others. We think it's just fantastic. But overall in terms of talking about numbers a bit too early. And as Ray said, we have a number out there for 2023, and, you know, we think it's conservative because we really think the opportunity is very large. Naved Khan : Makes sense, thank you. Aman Bhutani : Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Frank Volpe from Wolfe Research. Frank, please go ahead. Frank Volpe : Hi, everyone, Frank Volpe here for Deepak. Congratulations on a great quarter. Just wanted to ask you about the [indiscernible] business, obviously acquired more extensions. Before you spoke a lot about innovation being central to your strategy, I am just curious to know if you could highlight kind of what which innovations you're most excited about, as well as how we should think about timing, to building our business here larger? Aman Bhutani : Yeah, one of the things we realize is, you know, to innovate, we needed a bit more scale in that business. We need more TLDs. We need to be able to give the customer more choice. So, what you see here is us adding a bit of scale and of course there's some financial advantages to that too, but adding a bit of scale so that we can really drive a more innovative experience for our customers. Believe me we're doing some small things there and as soon as we have something that we're super excited about, you guys will hear about it. Frank Volpe : Absolutely. Ray Winborne : Hey Frank [indiscernible] we picked up right? Those are either owned or perpetual contract TLDs, meaning zero incremental costs. [Indiscernible]. Frank Volpe : Got it. And then just as a follow up, you know, we also struggled with that websites and marketing, as we, you know, coming out of the pandemic, and things are starting to reopen. Have you guys seen any kind of impact on customer acquisition costs, or any kind of \u2013 anything notable, we should be thinking about in terms of your marketing channels? Aman Bhutani : Yeah, I think, you know, as we talked about a little bit, the Q1 cohort was a strong cohort. And, you know, we'll continue to spend in marketing till we see the returns. And as Ray guided, you know, right now, we intend to continue to spend in marketing as best as we can see today. We see good returns for that marketing spend, or at least well within our guidelines. So that's what we're expecting to do. Obviously, there's no crystal ball and I can't talk about what's going to happen. But overall, we still feel pretty good about it. Frank Volpe : Right. So, no impact yet is what I'm hearing. Ray Winborne : No. In fact, as I mentioned, that first quarter cohort looked a lot like the size of the Q2, Q3 last year, so\u2026 Frank Volpe : All right, perfect. Thanks to everyone and regulations on the great quarter. Aman Bhutani : Thank you. Ray Winborne : Appreciate it. Christie Masoner : Thank you for joining us today. I'm going to turn the call over to Aman for some closing remarks. Aman Bhutani : Thank you, Christie. I wanted to take just a moment to thank Nima Kelly and Ray Winborne. Nima has been the backbone of this company for almost 20 years and her contribution is immeasurable. You know, I know this group doesn't get to see her, but Nima is always in the background with us on these calls and always helping out and has done so much for the company. And Ray, you know, just, you guys get to see him all the time, total joy to work with, such a professional. And Ray, I'm really glad you get to go out on a [beaten race], and Sterling joke, which Sterling you gave me a big laugh. You know that this is a good point to hand off to Mark for sure. So, thank you, Nima and Ray and thank you all GoDaddy employees for a great quarter and thanks to you all for joining the call.",

With that, here\u2019s Aman. Aman Bhutani : Thank you, Mark, and thank you all for joining us today. At GoDaddy, our mission is about making opportunity inclusive for all. We are committed to making everyday entrepreneurs successful through bold innovation and disciplined execution, we will succeed in our mission. More than 20 million customers rely on GoDaddy\u2019s seamless and intuitive technology, highly performant products and world class customer care to help them grow their business online and offline. As I look back at the last quarter and the last year, I am most proud of the acceleration in innovation at the company, even in the face of a pandemic. Our teams have done a fantastic job delivering new functionality for our customers and every quarter we are delivering more. Today, I will highlight some of those key product launches driven by the increasing velocity of experimentation in every part of our business. I have never been more confident in our ability to deliver value to our customers faster and drive long-term financial results for our shareholders. The vaccines had provided a new normal, but now we find the world challenged by the Delta variant. We\u2019re staying vigilant regarding any short-term impact from the difficulties our customers continue to face coming out of the pandemic. As I look at the rest of the year, and given our history of providing prudent guidance to our shareholders, I am confident that following a strong first half, we remain on track to achieve our full year financial targets. Our core focus is to drive value over the long-term through continuous improvements in our products and services. The long-term secular tailwinds in our industry continue to play to our strengths. As more people and businesses seek to sell their products and services online and offline, they need intuitive solutions and a trusted partner that can help guide them to growth. Our priorities are aligned with our customers, and they remain clear. First, driving commerce through presence, second, GoDaddy Pros, and third, innovation in domains. Everyday entrepreneurs look to GoDaddy for help with their number one priority to reach more of their customers and grow their business. It is also our number one priority and our investments reflect that. True to our promise, we have moved quickly this year with the launch of GoDaddy Payments, already available to all Websites + Marketing customers and managed WordPress customers in the U.S. Our ability to integrate Poynt and launch Payments quickly is a proof point of our platform-based approach to commerce and presence. We\u2019re dedicated to creating a seamless and intuitive experience for our customers built on a common platform. That increases our agility and speed to market. As further proof, we\u2019re already looking beyond Websites + Marketing and managed WordPress. We\u2019re launching GoDaddy PayLinks and Virtual Terminal. With PayLinks, GoDaddy customers will finally be able to say goodbye to sending paper invoices. PayLinks enables customers to take payments from anyone in the U.S. through a secure link. And with the Virtual Terminal, they can accept payments through iOS and Android on their phone or tablet without a card reader, ideal for farmers markets, craft fairs and other remote sales. And we have much more coming. We are on track to launch GoDaddy\u2019s OmniCommerce solution by the end of the year, empowering our customers to sell everywhere in their physical store, on their online store and across major platforms. And we have deepened our partnerships with the major platforms, especially Google and Facebook. GoDaddy customers can now display their product inventory directly within Google Search, Shopping, Image Search, and YouTube for free. They can also create listings and manage their Google Smart Ad campaigns directly within their GoDaddy Websites + Marketing dashboard. Customers can also manage their Facebook and Instagram ad campaigns from the same dashboard. Websites + Marketing continues to launch new capabilities including functionality for job listings, critical in the current environment, a robust FAQ widget, an enhanced email composer and much more. We have also completed the integration of Over, rebranding it as GoDaddy Studios. We\u2019ve expanded the functionality as well, and now GoDaddy customers can seamlessly create content on iOS and Android, and leverage that content on social networks and their website. Moving on to our second priority, GoDaddy Pros. We continue to focus on creating a seamless and intuitive experience with WordPress, while maintaining flexibility for Pros. We are committed to driving real improvements in the WordPress ecosystem, and are thrilled to share that one of GoDaddy\u2019s own led the release of the latest version of the Gutenberg editor for WordPress. WordPress has been the winning platform for Pros for years, and we are confident that WordPress will continue to be the winning platform for years to come. Earlier this year, we created a dramatically simplified onboarding experience, and we\u2019ve invested to make managed WordPress even more performant. And we\u2019re hearing from customers that they are noticing the difference. Our goal is to save time for Pros and inside the GoDaddy Hub we are seeing continued improvement. We are launching new capabilities in the Hub on a regular basis and we are particularly excited about introducing invoicing. With invoicing, Pros can bill their customers without needing a separate system. We also launched the new GoDaddy Pro brand in India this quarter and we are starting to see early signs of traction. India represents an enormous opportunity for GoDaddy, and we\u2019re looking forward to hosting our first event for Pros in India, later this year. And for our third priority, we continue to see remarkable strength in domains, driven by innovation in our aftermarket business, as well as strong renewals and continued new registrations. As you may recall, in Q4 last year we introduced List for Sale and multiple improvements in domain search. These innovations contributed to the nearly 20% year-over-year revenue growth in domains through the first half of this year. In Q2, we launched Buy It Now landing pages for domain investors to sell premium domains faster and more efficiently. And customers have reacted positively to it. One major domain investor moved approximately 50 thousand domains to GoDaddy\u2019s platform, and the improvement in their sales was so immediate that they decided to move over their entire portfolio of ccTLDs as well. The customer described the experience as an absolute game changer. We\u2019ve also continued to enhance the experience for buyers, with an improved search in our Auctions experience. We\u2019re thrilled with the outcomes in this space and excited about continuing to innovate. We\u2019re also seeing good progress in scaling our GoDaddy Registry business. With the recent acquisitions of additional Top Level Domains, or TLDs, GoDaddy Registry now manages more than 240 total TLDs, and we continue to look for ways to out-punch our weight in the Registry business. I\u2019m also super excited to share that we published GoDaddy\u2019s first Environmental, Social, and Governance or ESG report in June. I encourage you to read our report and learn about the fantastic initiatives going on inside GoDaddy. We look forward to setting goals and reporting on our ESG results regularly going forward. In closing, we have accelerated the pace of innovation within GoDaddy. Our strategy remains centered on building incredible products and creating value for everyday entrepreneurs around the world. We are prudent stewards of capital and remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders. With a number of organic and inorganic investments, especially around commerce and our upcoming OmniCommerce launch, we believe we are positioning GoDaddy for continued growth in our top line and our profits for years to come. With that, here\u2019s Mark. Thanks, Aman. It\u2019s great to be here on my first earnings call as GoDaddy\u2019s CFO. I\u2019m two months in, and I can tell that there is something special about GoDaddy\u2019s culture, people, vision and commitment to our customers. As Aman mentioned, there is an incredible opportunity ahead of this company, and I am very excited to join at this stage of the journey. I want to take a moment to discuss our financial results for the second quarter, and then I\u2019ll provide an update on what we\u2019re seeing now, and our financial outlook for Q3 and the rest of 2021. Q2 was a strong quarter, and that showed up in the financial results. Total revenue came in at $931 million, growing over 15% year-over-year, which includes about 1 point of currency tailwind. Our International business grew 19% on a reported basis, with approximately 3 points of currency tailwind. Business Applications was our fastest growing product line, increasing 22% year-over-year. We continued to see new customer attach, strong renewals, and existing customers adding additional seats of email and productivity solutions. Domains grew 18% year-over-year. As Aman mentioned, the innovation that the teams put in place late last year is driving performance in the aftermarket, which was a large contributor to the growth we saw in the second quarter. We are also seeing strong renewal rates from huge cohorts that joined last year and continued new registrations. And finally, hosting and presence grew 9% year-over-year, in line with our expectation of high single-digit growth. We continue to see very nice growth in our presence products like Websites + Marketing, tempered by slower growth in our legacy hosting and security business with continued year-over-year declines in social. Bookings came in at $1.05 billion, rising 13% year-over-year, with 2 points of currency tailwind. Strength in bookings in the quarter reflects similar drivers to what we called out for revenue. Gross margin came in at 64% in the quarter, in line with what we saw both last quarter, and in the second quarter last year. Product mix continues to drive the company\u2019s overall gross margin, and we\u2019re pleased with the 16% year-over-year growth we saw in gross profit dollars in the second quarter. Growth in both G&A and tech and dev expenses decelerated this quarter. As you\u2019ll recall, there were some one-time expenses related to our Poynt acquisition that were recognized in T&D and G&A in Q1 that didn\u2019t repeat in Q2. The growth rate in T&D remains above what we saw in 2020, reflecting the outstanding talent we added via the Poynt acquisition, and our continued investment in product development. Our marketing and advertising investment remains strong in Q2, though the year-over-year growth decelerated as we start to lap the elevated investment we made to capture the extraordinary demand we saw last year. Our growth and investment in the second quarter resulted in normalized EBITDA of $198 million, representing a growth of 22% year-over-year. Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter was $237 million, growing 27% year-over-year, driven by strong profitability, continued positive impacts from working capital, and disciplined CapEx investments as we continue shifting workloads to the cloud. Now onto the balance sheet. We finished Q2 with $1.4 billion in cash and total liquidity of nearly $2 billion. Net debt stands at $2.6 billion, below 3x net leverage on a trailing 12-month basis, and near the midpoint of our targeted range of 2x to 4x. GoDaddy has a strong liquidity position, access to both debt and equity capital markets, and resilient cash-generating operations. During the second quarter, we repurchased nearly 1 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $81 million, and announced acquisitions in the Registry space. Our priorities for capital allocation haven\u2019t changed. Our strategic priority is to grow the business, and we\u2019ll continue with organic investment as well as through acquisitions. We will continue to prioritize M&A over share repurchases. That said, we still have approximately $1 billion remaining on our repurchase authorization, and we expect to deploy capital to repurchase shares opportunistically. Moving on to our outlook. GoDaddy has a strong, resilient business model giving us confidence in our ability to achieve our full year targets. Following a strong first half, we want to acknowledge the evolving impact of the pandemic, COVID variants and access to the vaccines and we want to be prudent with our guidance for the second half of the year. We expect our full year revenue to be approximately $3.75 billion, or 13% growth year-over-year. And we continue to expect unlevered free cash flow of $955 million or 16% growth year-over-year. While we don\u2019t typically guide to bookings explicitly, we want to provide some color. We expect bookings growth to be a couple points below revenue growth in the back half of the year. Our forecast assumes that FX tailwinds will abate, and we\u2019re facing tough compares. We expect revenue growth in domains to moderate, especially in Q4, exiting the year growing low double digits. We\u2019re also facing tougher compares in the aftermarket as we lap the impact of the List for Sale tool and other improvements introduced in Q4 last year. The aftermarket, as you know, is a non-subscription business. We expect hosting and presence revenue to deliver mid single-digit growth for the full year. We continue to see low single-digit growth in our legacy hosting business. We\u2019re also lapping very difficult comps in our higher-growth products like Websites + Marketing, and continued declines in Social. We also note that the moderation of the FX tailwinds will disproportionately impact this line. We\u2019ve got a strong track record of driving growth, and our goal is to accelerate the growth in this category beyond 2021. We continue to expect high-teens growth in business applications for the year. With respect to investments and expenses, we continue investing in tech and dev, as we drive development of OmniCommerce and better scale our engineering and developer teams for long-term growth. Marketing spend is governed by returns, so we\u2019ll continue to monitor and adjust based on the demand we\u2019re seeing in the market. Investments here will likely be offset by continued leverage in customer care and G&A. For Q3, we expect total revenue of approximately $945 million, or 12% growth year-over-year with high-teens growth in business applications, mid-teens growth in domains as we lap a slightly tougher comp, and mid-single-digit growth in hosting and presence. As I wrap up my comments here, I want to express my thanks for the incredible welcome I\u2019ve received from all of the wonderful people at GoDaddy, as well as our partners throughout the industry and our analysts. I will do everything I can to ensure that we are executing against all the financial and strategic priorities we\u2019ve laid out, and that we\u2019re communicating clearly and transparently with all of our stakeholders. I know I have big shoes to fill, and I\u2019m looking forward to meeting many of you in the coming weeks and months as we virtually hit the road. With that, we\u2019ll have Christie Masoner from our IR team, open up the call for questions. A - Christie Masoner : Thanks, Mark. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Trevor Young from Barclays. Trevor, please go ahead. Trevor Young : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Just on a segment basis, it seems like the H&P guide was a bit softer than prior commentary. If I heard you correctly, Mark, you said mid single digit growth for the full year. Can you help us understand what changed? And then also remind us to what the impact is in 3Q from lapping M&A, or is that more of just a 4Q impact? Thank you. Mark McCaffrey : Thanks, Trevor and happy to elaborate a bit. Let\u2019s start with \u2013 we\u2019re facing tough comps when it comes to some of our higher product growth, right? Websites + Marketing and things such as that I would also say, FX is not working in our favor in the second half where we assumed we will not have the same tailwinds. And we continue to see low growth in our hosting and security. So that coupled together kind of has put us today mid single digit growth for the year. I would also add we\u2019re being pretty prudent when it comes to looking at customer behaviour, especially as we get into the second half of the year. We just want to acknowledge there\u2019s a lot going on with our consumers. And we think this is the place to be right now. As far as the lapping in Q3 and Q4, we see part of it in Q3 and the bulk of it in Q4. Trevor Young : Great. Thanks. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Brent Bracelin from Piper Sandler. Brent, please go ahead. Clarke Jeffries : Hi. This is Clarke Jeffries on for Brent. Firstly, I\u2019ll say Aman, really encouraging to hear about the product innovation and how quickly the company has been able to iterate on the Poynt portfolio. It\u2019s exciting progress so far. On that point, could you help us understand what\u2019s the current level of adoption you\u2019re seeing in Payments? And maybe what are some of your key strategies for encouraging adoption? Some of your peers have pursued transaction feeds for not selecting the preferred payment rails. So, correct me if I\u2019m wrong, but you\u2019re not doing that strategy specifically. So I just want to see where do you see potential for push versus pull strategies to increasing adoption? Aman Bhutani : Thanks, Clarke. As you know, we\u2019ve just launched GoDaddy Payments and we\u2019re seeing a good reaction from customers. They\u2019re excited, they\u2019re clicking on it, they\u2019re choosing the product. So it\u2019s a great, great start. Overall, our timing on commerce was about getting to the OmniCommerce solution later this year, next year is about marketing and experimentation with pricing. So you\u2019ll see us experiment with a lot of our models out there. And as we go through that, we\u2019re going to pick what\u2019s best for our customers and shareholders together. So no specific comment on various pricing strategies, but we\u2019ve got to start and we\u2019re going to try a lot of stuff out. Clarke Jeffries : Great. And if I could have a follow-up for Mark, just could you comment on the legacy hosting and security business. Just what are the growth expectations long-term for that segment? How should we be thinking about the moderation currently in that segment? And is there an R&D push here, any kind of change in industry demand that we should anticipate for that segment going forward? Mark McCaffrey : Yes. Thanks. And I\u2019ll start with saying, a lot of the hosting and security is driven by traffic. And as in that particular area, we\u2019re monitoring the traffic very closely. We think it will continue with low digit growth throughout the year. We\u2019ll take a look at what the long-term prospects are. And I\u2019ll just start with or say, I\u2019m looking forward to checking in with everybody six months from now and looking at the 2022 guidance as we put it forth. Clarke Jeffries : Great. Thank you very much. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Ygal Arounian from Wedbush. Ygal, please go ahead. Ygal, please unmute your line. Ygal Arounian : Sorry about that. Good afternoon. So you guys had good outperformance in the quarter and just trying to think through the second half and the puts and takes. And I know you addressed it a little bit. So if I remember correctly last quarter, you talked about how we\u2019d be facing some challenging comps in domains, but continued innovation there can keep growth elevated for longer. So, on the domain side, where do you guys think you are relative to that kind of target that traction that you talked about last quarter in terms of innovation and keeping growth stronger? And similarly on the presence side, I mean, we\u2019ve got a lot of pieces coming together around commerce and the omni-channel piece is coming in later this year, and I know it\u2019s still early on the omni-channel front, but payments and everything else. What are the things that investors should be looking for to get better confidence that that the Presence segment is growing faster and getting stronger as you put these things together. Thanks. Aman Bhutani : Thanks, Ygal. Continue to be super excited about the innovation in the domains business. As I\u2019ve talked about last time as well, we\u2019re continuing to do more every quarter. And the goal here is to build the innovation factory, where we\u2019re the leader in this space and we\u2019re going to just continue to innovate. But we can only guide, what we see, we can\u2019t guide to sort of future innovation. But it\u2019s happening every quarter. Just this quarter, I talked about it in the prepared comments, we launched Buy-It-Now landers, and they\u2019ve been adopted really, really well by our domain investor customers. So you\u2019ll continue to see us do it. It\u2019s just \u2013 when it comes to guidance, we\u2019ll talk about what we see and what we know. And in terms of presence, we continue to see fantastic growth in \u2013 in our growth products like Websites + Marketing and managed WordPress. They\u2019re still outgrowing our overall business, even though they have some really tough comps year-over-year, so super excited about the work happening there as well. Ygal Arounian : Okay. Thanks. And if I could follow-up on the comments around customer behaviour. And you\u2019ve had really strong customer behavior for \u2013 essentially since the early days of the pandemic. Are you seeing things changed or still down? I would think any kind of resurgence in COVID would kind of bring customer behavior even stronger, not weaker. Just let\u2019s talk about from what you\u2019re seeing there. Aman Bhutani : At a macro level, obviously we\u2019re all excited to have vaccine and be able to have a sense of normal, but these are unprecedented times. We don\u2019t really know how customer behavior is shifting. And my view always goes to whatever changes we see are short-term, long-term the opportunity in terms of online and offline coming together as massive. Our customers need to get out there, they need to sell everywhere. We\u2019re building a set of products, portfolio services that meet that need. We have a massive brand. So I\u2019m just super bullish our opportunity long-term there. Mark McCaffrey : Aman, I\u2019ll jump onto that a bit. We continue to be really, really excited about the long-term prospects. But we\u2019ve been prudent in the guidance, we\u2019re taking a look at the market. We\u2019re taking a look at the behavior and we\u2019ll continue to monitor for the short-term. Ygal Arounian : Appreciate the answers guys. Thanks. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Ron Josey from JMP. Ron, please go ahead. Ron Josey : Great. Thanks for taking the question. Appreciate it. Aman, you might\u2019ve touched on this earlier, but I wanted to ask a little bit more here just with commerce being a top priority overall and payments now live omni-channel solution coming. So maybe just asking as we exit 2021 and go into 2022, when these products evolve here, just talk to us about just the next call it, how you view commerce evolving on GoDaddy. Do you think we\u2019re still into building out new products or now we\u2019re in execution mode? I think you might\u2019ve answered this earlier or at least unnecessarily, but I wanted to ask it maybe a different way. And then I want to also talk about the Google Merchant Center product that was announced, I think a few weeks back. Just talk about how this integration here could really play out going forward. Thank you. Aman Bhutani : Thank you, Ron. And on commerce, as we\u2019ve discussed, the strategy is about meeting a broad set of needs for our customers. And 2021 is the build here, we\u2019re moving very, very quickly. We\u2019ve got payments out there. I talked about PayLinks, Virtual Terminal. We\u2019re going to have OmniCommerce by the end of the year. We\u2019re talking about invoicing for GoDaddy Pro. So a lot happening in the commerce space where we\u2019re looking at the customer need and we\u2019re bringing it out very quickly. 2022 is the year of experimentation. It\u2019s really too early right now to talk about what different things may happen there. We\u2019re going to go-to-market, there\u2019s a set of marketing experiments, set of experiments around pricing that we\u2019re going to be working on. And generally the initial reaction is from customers where they see our products and they want to work with GoDaddy on it. And in terms of Google or some of the Facebook announcements as well, what we\u2019re most excited about is creating a seamless and intuitive experience for our customers. For our customers to be able to go into one dashboard and manage systems, not just for their online store and with OmniCommerce there in store, but to be able to manage their spend on major platforms, all from the same place, all on look and feel seamless, intuitive, easy. That\u2019s what we\u2019re looking for. That\u2019s what we\u2019re most excited about. Ron Josey : Great. Thank you, Aman. Aman Bhutani : Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from Nick Jones from Citi. Nick, please go ahead. Nick Jones : Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, kind of two along the same line of thinking. I guess, Mark can you give an update on the kind of M&A we can expect. You made some acquisitions in domains, there was Poynt, I mean, there are other sizable acquisitions out there you could make? Or should we think about it more as tuck-ins? And then maybe separately, how do you think about partnerships in terms of kind of enabling SMBs to really utilize your platform to the fullest extent for those who maybe don\u2019t know how to? Thanks. Mark McCaffrey : Yes, thanks, Nick. I'll take that one. Really quick, obviously, we don't comment on ongoing M&A, but we will continue to look at opportunities that bring value to our customers. The one great thing about our balance sheet is, it gives us optionality to look at all sorts of deals. But we're not going to comment on anything currently. When it comes to partnerships, our ecosystem is extremely important. We will continue to look at that ecosystem and again, where it makes sense to partner with people in the market and everything is about the focus on the customer and bringing them value and ultimately strengthening that ecosystem. Christie Masoner : Nick, please unmute your line. Our next question comes from Drew Glaeser from JPMorgan. Drew, please go ahead. Drew Glaeser : Hi, this is Drew on for Sterling. So we've seen news reports that GoDaddy, well pass along the Verizon \u2013 Verisign price increase when it goes into effect in September. Can you confirm whether that will be the case and how you expect that to impact revenue and margins? Aman Bhutani : Yes, the tradition in the industry has been for registrars to pass on that pricing. What's important about that with GoDaddy is that we have a segmented customer base and we take a nuanced approach to that pricing based on the type of customer. So we will be doing that the same strategy that we have done in the past. And I'll turn it to Mark to talk about the revenue. Mark McCaffrey : Thanks, Aman. And we have built this into the forecast. We had it in all along these things aren't unusual and as Aman mentioned, we've traditionally passed them on. So they are in the forecast for the second half. Drew Glaeser : Okay, got it. Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe. Deepak, please go ahead. Frank Volpe : Hi, everyone. Frank Volpe here for Deepak. So just expanding on that last question about Verisign price increases, I wanted to get your opinion on whether you expect industry wide adoption of these higher prices. And then on the registry business, do you see any other interesting opportunities or other extensions that you can eventually integrate with the products? I mean, if you can't disclose anything confidential, that's fine. Just how we should be looking at it, is this important here? Aman Bhutani : Hi. Yes, I can take that. On the pricing for other players, obviously I can't comment to what other companies are going to do, but obviously the historically you can look at what companies have done probably got a pretty good idea. On the registry business, continue to be really excited about what we can do there for the industry as a whole. As I talked about last quarter, our first goal there is to get to create a scale and you saw us do a few acquisitions. We announced 240 TLDs. Our goal is to have a certain scale where we can experiment with innovative ideas. We do have a few ideas and I've talked about one or two in the past, but where as we get closer to them and customers likely see them, I'd love for them to get out there and then we can talk about them more. Frank Volpe : Got it. And then just one more, if I can, can you give us some perspective on share buybacks the next few quarters and how we should be thinking about those? Mark McCaffrey : Thanks. And I'll take that one. We always look at capital allocation and as we've said in the script, our priority is around accelerating growth whether organically or through M&A having said that we will continue to look at share buyback and be opportunistic and provide value back to our shareholders where appropriate. Frank Volpe : Great. Thanks so much. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Naved Khan from Truist. Naved, please go ahead. Naved Khan : Yes. Can you hear me okay? Just maybe I missed it, but did you guys talk about subscriber growth in the quarter [Audio Dip] how it compares to past few quarters. And maybe another question, you can help us understand and bit of summarize. Just a mix of e-commerce in Websites + Marketing roughly [Audio Dip] e-commerce, is that still the case? Mark McCaffrey : I had a tough time hearing the question there. So I'm going to answer what I think was the second part, and then we might have do a repeat on the first part. I think you were asking for kind of directional guidance on the impact of e-commerce. I will tell you, well we're really, really excited about the launch of payments in the first half. And the launch of omni-commerce in the second half where we're not getting into the financial numbers, we're still looking at the impact on our customers. And if you could go back to the first question. Christie Masoner : Yes. Naved, we lost your audio in your first question, if you could repeat the first part of the question Mark McCaffrey : Into that matter, if I didn't get the second question, right. Let me know. It was kind of in and out. Naved Khan : Let me try one more time. Hopefully, you get it now. So the first question is, just around subscriber, number four for the second quarter and how that compares with the growth in the past report that we have seen. And the second question I had was just around the mix of commerce subscribers. I think in the past, we've talked about the roughly 25%, is that still the case? Aman Bhutani : Thanks, Naved for repeating the question. On subscriber accounts, we don't disclose that on a quarterly basis. So we'll share that with you at the end of the year and in terms of our commerce solutions, that part of Websites + Marketing customers continue to lean into that. We've continued to lean in and add more and more functionality. So that continues to do well for us. Naved Khan : Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Elliott from Morgan Stanley. Elizabeth, please go ahead. Elizabeth, please unmute your line. Our next question comes from line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Brent Thill, please go ahead. Brent Thill : Thanks. There were some questions around Verisign price hike and how you tend this pass that through. Can you just comment on that intended price hike, and then secondarily Aman, when you look at the business apps high teens growth, could you just lay out, , the engines of, of how you're getting there, maybe if you could just talk to, you know, broader how, how, you know, what's underlying that confidence to get to that growth rate on the, on the business app side, on the components of growth. Thank you. Aman Bhutani : Yes, sure. Brent, thank you. On the pricing increase with Verisign, what I talked about was that we have a segment of strategy. So we have different types of customers and we changed pricing at different levels for them. Traditionally registrars have passed on the pricing from registries. So there is a pass on from us, but as Mark commented, that's been in our guide. But it's a segment in nuance approach. So I just want folks to understand that about the company as a whole. In terms of the second part of your question, sorry, what was the second part? Brent Thill : You think the engines of growth [Audio Dip] applications initiative. Aman Bhutani : Yes, sorry, there's little delay. In terms of the business apps growth that continues to be a function of customers\u2019 on boarding on our email products, both the Microsoft solution that we have and OX and us growing with our customers. But those customers do well are successful, is to see growth with them. We continue to be underpenetrated here. There's a ton of opportunity as we reach more and more customers as we make the experience. And what are there have been some on boarding improvements for customers that we've been able to do. We've come been able to continue to drive growth with existing customers and new customers there. Brent Thill : [Technical Difficulty] Christie Masoner : Brent, we're getting your \u2013 we're getting a breakup on your line. If you could try again. That concludes our call for the day. Thank you everyone for joining us and I'll turn it over to Aman for some closing remarks. Aman Bhutani : Thank you all for joining. A quick thank you to all the GoDaddy employees for accelerating the innovation at the company and we look forward to talking to you next quarter.",

    "content": "\ufeff Mark Grant : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for GoDaddy's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. I'm Mark Grant, Vice President of Investor Relations. With me on the call today are Aman Bhutani, Chief Executive Officer; and Mark McCaffrey, Chief Financial Officer. Following prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions. On today's call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and operating metrics, such as total bookings, unlevered free cash flow, normalized EBITDA, annualized recurring revenue, or ARR, gross merchandise volume, or GMV, and net debt. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents may be found in the presentation posted to our Investor Relations website at investors.godaddy.net or on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC with today's earnings release. The matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements, which include those related to our future financial results, our strategies or objectives with respect to future operations, new product introductions and innovations, partner integrations, our ability to integrate acquisitions and achieve desired synergies and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, November 3, 2021, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events unless required by law. With that, here's Aman. Aman Bhutani : Thank you, Mark, and thank you all for joining us today. GoDaddy has made remarkable progress this quarter in our mission to make opportunity more inclusive for all, and we are incredibly excited about what the future holds for our company. We've continued accelerating our product innovation, maintained focus on gaining further customer traction. And in September, we celebrated what we consider to be the most significant product launch in our company's history. GoDaddy products are designed to serve various types of customers. We serve millions of independent entrepreneurs seeking to create and grow their business, both online and off-line. We serve the professional makers of the web who leverage our tools to build websites for their own clients, and we serve a growing body of domain investors who leverage the largest and most active domain aftermarket in the world. Today, I'd like to highlight a few of the most impactful initiatives for these customers and help this audience understand a little bit better why I have never been more excited to be leading this great company. Looking first at the macro environment, we track demand by monitoring a couple of key metrics, including search query volume. That is the number of potential customers searching online for products we sell as well as we look at gross customer adds in any given period. We are pleased that some of the uneven demand signals seen over the summer did not prevent us from delivering strong results in Q3. Relative to the demand signals we were seeing in July, we are starting to feel better as normal seasonality appears to be returning to the business. We are still hyperfocused on delivering customer value, unlocking new TAM and increasing new revenue streams, all while generating strong durable cash flow. We have exciting updates to the three priorities we laid out to you in 2021 : first, driving success in commerce through presence; second, winning with GoDaddy Pros; and third, innovating new Domains. As you heard me say consistently this year, driving success in commerce through presence is our top priority for 2021, and we took a giant leap forward in Q3. As many of you saw, we had a huge product launch in September. With the introduction of off-line hardware solutions to complement our online solutions, we now have all tools in place for our OmniCommerce offering. We introduced our OmniCommerce offerings for Websites + Marketing, giving our customers the tools they need to sell anything anywhere. We have exciting plans for OmniCommerce beyond Websites + Marketing and look forward to sharing those updates with you soon. We've said that 2021 would be about building the products and getting them out by the end of this year and that 2022 would be about experimentation with pricing, go-to-market strategies, bundling, new SKUs and promotions. One of the best things about getting the products launched three months early is that we get to start the experimentation earlier, too. We have already begun exploring options for bundles, new SKUs and go-to-market strategies to make OmniCommerce the easiest and simplest way for a merchant to set up an omnichannel commerce venture. Our OmniCommerce solutions give small businesses the ability to sell, track and manage their sales in more places than any other comparable platform. In September, we launched state-of-the-art point-of-sale devices, Smart Terminal and Card Reader, that communicate across systems, spanning online, off-line and third-party platforms. The point-of-sale launch rounds out the GoDaddy Payments and commerce package comprised of e-commerce, Virtual Terminal, Online Pay Links and now off-line transactions as well. Customers were thrilled to see GoDaddy's commitment to their success when we introduced industry-leading pricing in our terminals and payment transaction fees. We believe GoDaddy is the most merchant-friendly commerce solutions vendor in the industry right now. We wanted to make these stunning, innovative and feature-rich point-of-sale devices accessible to the greatest number of potential merchants, and our pricing reflects that priority. These devices work with our Websites + Marketing solutions as well as the WooCommerce and WordPress platform, furthering our commitment to seamlessly intuitive experiences GoDaddy customers can configure these devices online before they arrive, including adding product listings, logo and custom receipts. So the device is ready for transactions as soon as it arrives, two days later with free shipping. And we are allowing our customers to keep more of each dollar they earn. We introduced the lowest effective payments pricing available in the U.S. GoDaddy will charge an in-person transaction fee of 2.3% plus $0.00, while online transactions will be charged 2.3% plus $0.30. On average, a customer would save over 20% with GoDaddy Payments on transaction fees for online and in-person when compared to other leading providers transaction fees. GoDaddy customers continue to grow their online and off-line businesses. In Q3, annualized GMV across GoDaddy products increased nearly 30% year-over-year to approximately $25 billion. Poynt continues to account for the majority, roughly $20 billion, and Sellbrite and Websites + Marketing, both continue to grow year-over-year even with 2020's tough comps. We're also pleased to share that across our Create and Grow products, Websites + Marketing, Managed WordPress, Sellbrite and GoDaddy Studios, ARR surpassed $400 million, growing 17% year-over-year. To help our customers navigate and grow their business, we launched the Commerce Hub. The Commerce Hub is designed to help customers easily manage and track every sale online, off-line or both. Similar to our GoDaddy Pro Hub, the Commerce Hub includes an intuitive dashboard that provides bird's-eye view metrics on business performance, including visualizations, mapping sales and orders, comparison tools to help entrepreneurs see which channels are performing best, single sign-on capabilities and access to inventory tracking tools. We introduced all of this innovation at our virtual OPEN 2021 event in September with our partner, Naomi Osaka, who launched her own brand of skincare products with GoDaddy as the official e-commerce partner. OPEN 2021 included breakout sessions for our customers to learn more about branding, marketing and sales growth and to help them network with other entrepreneurs. More than 20,000 people attended the virtual event, materially surpassing the turnout we saw last year even in the midst of the pandemic-driven digitization of small business. As you can see, we have an ambitious view of what we can accomplish in Commerce and Presence, and we're just getting started. We're excited to show you more of what our products can do and share more of what we plan to accomplish with those products at our Investor Day in a few short months. Moving on to Pros. We know that designers and developers prefer WordPress, and GoDaddy remains the global champion of WordPress, serving Pros with both our legacy hosting and our Managed WordPress solutions. Earlier this year, we shared details of the Pro Hub launch, and we set out an ambitious goal of bringing 300,000 new and current GoDaddy Pros into the Pro Hub by the end of the year. We are on track to reach this goal. The powerful functionality of the Pro Hub simplifies Pros' work and serves as another example of GoDaddy delivering on our commitment to increase value to our customers now. The first step now well underway is getting Pros in and engaged with the Pro Hub so they can see firsthand how much easier it makes their professional life. The second step, which is yet to come, is to find ways to share economics and capture more wallet share among those Pros in a way that makes them more successful as well. This quarter, we launched simple Invoicing and Payments solutions for Pros available within the Pro Hub, eliminating the need for Pros to track and manage yet another third-party point solution. This was a major pain point for GoDaddy Pros. Invoicing and Payment's functionality was the most requested feature in our Pro ecosystem. We were happy to deliver and almost immediately, we saw good adoption. Lastly, we continued facilitating and harnessing the exponential power of the GoDaddy community, hosting our first GoDaddy event in India, specifically for Pros. As you recall, we held the GoDaddy Expand event in April for designers, developers and agency pros in the United States. In September, we expanded this event, hosting another country-specific GoDaddy Expand event in India. We were humbled to see thousands of Pros registered for the event, giving us a forum to help them. Customer feedback from the Expand event in India was very positive, summed up well by one customer who said I was blown away by the professional selection of topics and presenters. Moving on to Domains. This business has been fantastic for GoDaddy this past year, and it continues to outperform the industry by a large margin. As we have been sharing throughout the year, our teams continue to innovate in all areas, primary registrations, the Domains aftermarket and GoDaddy Registry, driving fantastic revenue growth. Aftermarket continues to drive significant year-over-year growth as we still benefit from the list of sale tools introduced in Q4 of last year. On Registry, we are continuing to prove our ability to acquire, integrate and accelerate. A great example is the cohort performance within GoDaddy Registry. When we acquired Neustar's Registry assets in Q3 last year, its new cohorts were shrinking with new unit registrations down 4% year-over-year. We are now 1 year into the acquisition, and we're pleased to report that within that first year, we have been able to accelerate new business significantly. We are now seeing new unit registrations increased nearly 20% year-over-year, all organically. There is still significant room for innovation and improvement in both the Registry and Registrar sites of our domain business, and we have several exciting initiatives in the works. We're excited to share more about what we're cooking up in Domains at our Investor Day. Before I finish up, I wanted to take a moment to talk about our upcoming Investor Day in February, announced a few weeks ago. We wanted to give people a heads up that it was coming because we expect to share some really exciting things. We expect to discuss our long-term strategy, innovation initiatives, financial framework, capital allocation strategy and go-forward financial reporting structure. We look forward to engaging with you to get your thoughts and feedback as we prepare for this event. In closing, we're quite happy with the results this quarter and GoDaddy's ability to pursue enormous opportunities ahead. We are well positioned as a true global leader with increasing customer touch points and ability to provide essential technology solutions. GoDaddy at its core is a great business that has and will continue to generate predictable results with an attractive financial profile, profitable growth at scale and durable cash flow. Importantly, we'll maintain a relentless focus on increasing shareholder value and have demonstrated the capability to invest capital prudently. We are committed to continuing our pace of innovation, bringing important new solutions to customers, driving progress across the entire industry and continuing to drive the value creation flywheel. With that, here's Mark. Mark McCaffrey : Thanks, Aman. I want to take a moment to discuss our financial results for the third quarter and then move to our financial outlook for the rest of 2021. Q3 was a strong quarter, which showed up in the financial results. Total revenue came in at $964 million, growing over 14% year-over-year, which includes 70 basis points of currency tailwind. Our international business grew at 13% on a reported basis, with approximately two points of currency tailwind. As an [Technical Difficulty] trends in the top of the funnel signals continue to be below the elevated demand we saw last year, but in line with 2019. Hosting and Presence grew 7% year-over-year, delivering at the high end of our expectations for mid-single-digit growth. We continue to see nice growth in our Presence products like Websites + Marketing, tempered by slower growth in our legacy hosting and security business. And while it's still too early to provide any details, we are really pleased with what we are seeing so far from our OmniCommerce launch in September as well as the uptake we're seeing from the GoDaddy Payments more broadly. Within Hosting and Presence, we're pleased to share an update to the previously disclosed ARR metric from our Create and Grow group of products, which includes Websites + Marketing, Managed WordPress, Sellbrite and GoDaddy Studios. The suite of products passed $400 million in ARR in Q3. Within that suite, ARR from Websites + Marketing grew more than 20% year-over-year in Q3, and more specifically, Websites + Marketing commerce ARR grew more than 30% year-over-year in Q3. Lastly, annualized GMV across the GoDaddy ecosystem was approximately $25 billion, growing nearly 30% year-over-year. We saw growth across all channels, primarily driven by off-line point-of-sale as we lap online tailwinds from COVID. Domains grew 17% year-over-year. The innovation the teams put in place late last year is driving performance in the aftermarket, which was a large contributor to the growth we saw in the third quarter. We also continue to see consistent renewals and comp primary registrations. And finally, Business Applications was our fastest-growing product line, increasing 20% year-over-year. We continue to see new customer attach, strong renewals and existing customers adding additional seats of e-mail and productivity solutions. Bookings came in at $1.04 billion, rising 10% year-over-year, with 80 basis points of currency tailwind. Strength in bookings in the quarter reflect similar drivers to what we called out for revenue. Gross margin came in at 64% in the quarter, in line with what we saw both last quarter and the mid-60 range we've guided to. Product mix continues to drive the company's overall gross margin. Given the Payments launch and the pricing we announced in September, we expect Payments revenue to have two different margin impacts as it scales. Payments revenue will put some pressure on gross margins as the revenue stream gets larger in the coming quarters and years. However, there are relatively low incremental operating costs once those customers are acquired and set up on GoDaddy Payments. So we expect Payments to be highly accretive to normalized EBITDA over time. Investment in tech and dev was consistent with last quarter as we continue to accelerate our pace of innovation while maintaining fiscal discipline. We continue to get leverage in G&A as travel and other office expenses remain below historical levels. Consistent with last quarter, our marketing and advertising investment remained strong in Q3, though the year-over-year growth decelerated as we started to lap the elevated investment we made to capture the extraordinary demand we saw last year. Our growth and investment in the second quarter resulted in normalized EBITDA of $228 million, representing growth of 15% year-over-year. Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter was $252 million, growing 12% year-over-year, driven by strong profitability, continued positive impacts from working capital and disciplined CapEx investment as we continue shifting workloads to the cloud. We note, however, due to the global supply chain issues impacting technology hardware like servers, some of our planned CapEx spending shifted into Q4. We expect to continue our CapEx investment in Q4, bringing unlevered free cash flow in line with our full year guide. Now on to the balance sheet and capital allocation. We finished Q2 with $1.1 billion in cash and total liquidity of $1.7 billion. Net debt stands at $2.8 billion below 3x net leverage on a trailing 12-month basis and near the midpoint of our targeted range of 2x to 4x. GoDaddy has a strong liquidity position, access to both debt and equity capital markets and resilient cash-generating operations. During the third quarter, we executed an accelerated share repurchase buying 3.4 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of $250 million. We also allocated nearly $200 million to acquisitions in the Registry space. As we think about capital priorities, we will continue to balance M&A and share repurchases to make sure capital is deployed in the way that we believe will generate the best long-term returns for shareholders. After the completion of the ASR mentioned above, we have approximately $750 million remaining on our repurchase authorization. Moving on to our outlook. GoDaddy is on track to outperform the initial revenue and unlevered free cash flow targets we laid out at the beginning of the year. Looking at Q4, we expect total revenue of approximately $970 million or 11% growth year-over-year. Based on our outperformance in Q3 and our expectations for Q4, we're raising our full year revenue guidance to approximately $3.765 billion, a 14% growth year-over-year. As I noted earlier, some of our CapEx spending has shifted from Q3 to Q4. Based on our continued plan for approximately $60 million in CapEx spending for the full year and the strong performance we've seen year-to-date, we're raising the unlevered free cash flow guidance to $960 million or 16% growth year-over-year. As we mentioned last quarter, we still expect bookings growth to be a couple of points below revenue growth in the final quarter of the year as FX tailwinds continue to abate and we face the tough compares from Q4 of last year. In Q4, we expect Domains revenue to grow low double digits as we lap the tougher compares in the aftermarket from the impact of our list for sale tool and the other improvements introduced in Q4 last year that we talked about last quarter. The aftermarket, as you know, is a non-subscription business, therefore, it does not impact our deferred revenue at the end of the period. We expect Hosting and Presence revenue to deliver mid-single-digit growth for the full year. We continue to see low single-digit growth in our legacy hosting business. We're also lapping very difficult comps in our higher growth products like Websites + Marketing and the top of the funnel softness we saw over the summer will take some time to rebuild, even with the improvements seen in September and October. We've got a strong track record of driving growth. And with an impressive slate of new offerings coming to market, we remain optimistic that we will be able to accelerate the growth of Hosting and Presence next year. We continue to expect high-teens growth in Business Applications for the full year, driven by customer attach, seek growth among existing customers and upgrades to higher-priced tiers of productivity solutions. With respect to investments and expenses, we'll continue investing in the tech and dev as we work to maintain the product momentum we've seen year-to-date. Based on the current demand environment, we're expecting our absolute marketing spend to be relatively flat sequentially in Q4. We continue to expect investments to be largely offset by continued leverage in customer care and G&A. We are still comfortable with the 4-1-1 targets we set out early last year, and we'll provide more specific formal guidance in February. Some of the revenue streams that we expect to become more impactful over time like Payments in aftermarket are recognized immediately. So we would expect bookings growth and revenue growth to converge over time. GoDaddy has an incredibly bright road ahead and is well equipped with both the innovation and the financial resources needed to pursue and capture the immense opportunity before us. Our consistent cash generation gives us multiple levers to generate significant returns for our shareholders, and we're committed to doing just that. As we prepare for our Investor Day in February, I'm excited about the direction of the company, our strategic vision and the plans we are putting in place to enhance investor communication and outreach. GoDaddy is committed to providing investors with the information they need each quarter to model their business confidently, value the business effectively and hold us accountable for executing against our stated objective. It's going to be an exciting day, and we look forward to being with all of you then. With that, we'll have Christie Masoner from our Investor Relations team open up the call for questions. A - Christie Masoner : Thanks, Mark. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ygal Arounian from Wedbush. Ygal, please go ahead. Ygal Arounian : Okay, good afternoon, guys. I guess I'll start at the highest level. And just trying to understand, you had some good solid outperformance across the board in 3Q. You talked about customer softness at last earnings, it was kind of the peak of the summer and vacations and the shift to travel and entertainment and all that. Can you talk about how the customer trends have evolved since then? Why -- and why the outperformance in light of those headwinds, I feel like they were the strongest over the summer, aren't translating into your guidance on 4Q? Aman Bhutani : Thanks, Ygal. I can take that. Obviously, we're very happy that our strong execution enabled us to deliver strong results in Q3. Even though as we shared with you, there was sort of the uneven demand signals that we were seeing over the summer. To answer your question and give you a little bit of sort of chronological view on it, we saw the drop most in July. There was a stabilization in August and then improved a bit in September, and October is working out in line with September. So we're still continuing to monitor, but we're cautiously optimistic about normal seasonality returning to the business, and that's what you're seeing in the guidance. We would like to share with you exactly what we see, which we did last time, and we're looking to do that again this time. Ygal Arounian : Okay, thanks. I'll ask about the Neustar and the cohort growth there. Can you just maybe give a little bit more color on what exactly is happening there that is turning the business around from pre-M&A to post M&A? Thanks. Aman Bhutani : Yes, super excited and proud of the team. The GoDaddy Registry team is come into GoDaddy. They've had to go through the integration. We're growing scale for them, as you know, and we have new businesses to integrate with them. But all through it, they have maintained really strong execution. So it's really about good strong execution, the team coming together, it's a small team, but they've done a fantastic job. And of course, as much as we can, we have the ability of that team working with GoDaddy leaders and looking for opportunities and looking for brands. And as I've shared in the past, we'll continue to share with you specific innovations that come forward, but this one is just execution, right? Ygal Arounian : Great, thanks so much. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Clarke Jeffries from Piper Sandler. Clarke, please go ahead. Clarke Jeffries : Hello. Great to see another quarter of strong results ahead of guidance. I wanted to understand what the expectations are for durable growth in the Create and Grow products? I know as we are exiting tough compares and some of that top of funnel softness you called out, I just want to understand what kind of growth rate you would orient us to looking beyond 2021? And maybe even if not talking about beyond 2021, could you help us maybe understand some historical context to what that segment was growing sort of pre-pandemic? Mark McCaffrey : Yes. Thanks, Clarke. And I'll take the first part of it and then maybe hand it to Aman for the historical part. We're seeing positive signs in our Create and Grow, and we are really happy with the ARR around Websites + Marketing with 20% and Websites + Marketing commerce at 30%. Acknowledging the softness and looking at Q4, that funnel slowdown will take a little bit of time to rebuild like we said in our comments, but we're really optimistic on the positive signs. As we also said, we're comfortable with the 4-1-1 moving forward, and we are really looking forward to catching up with one everybody on Investor Day and kind of putting it all together so we can communicate to you. Clarke Jeffries : Great. And then now with the OmniCommerce solution out in market, I just wanted to understand what allowed you to release industry-leading pricing on POS transactions, 2.3 plus 30. What gives you the flexibility to grant this kind of pricing compared to peers? Aman Bhutani : Yes. I'm happy to start there. The real build here is to look at it from the ground up and say, what do our customers need to make these products accessible for them? And we broke down the pricing structure, and it's about technology and innovation. And as you know, we have a fantastic team from Poynt. And our goal is to not lose any money in payments or in hardware. Our goal is to build it up from the bottom, innovate, pass on the value to the customer. And I'm excited about the idea that customers look at this pricing and they adopt and that we see a lot of demand for our products. Clarke Jeffries : Okay. Thank you very much. Aman Bhutani : Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Nick Jones from Citi. Nick, please go ahead. Nicholas Jones : Great, thanks for taking the questions. I guess just on the Domains business, are you seeing any success kind of tilting Domain shoppers towards the TLDs that you own as opposed to maybe dotcom, which I think is generally more popular? And then the second question is, can you remind us how the Verisign kind of dotcom price increases will trickle through? I think it's likely to become a bigger impact next year as it flows through dot coms I think people are expecting to take another price increase sometime next year? So those are the two questions. Thanks. Aman Bhutani : Thank you, Nick. On the giving preferential treatment to certain TLDs that we may own, we don't do that. All TLDs work on our registrar side in terms of their merit. It's about value to the customer whatever works best irrespective of whether we own the registry side or not. That's what we'll sell in front of the customer. We do -- to your question on Verisign price increases, as you well know, I think we -- our pricing is quite nuanced. We have pricing that's different by customer populations. We have pricing that's different by geography. We're pricing that differs when we bundle as an example. So we are always experimenting with pricing. We're always looking to optimize. And we realize that as GoDaddy, we have an opportunity to truly look at our options. And if it makes sense, and as you know, over time, registrars have passed Registry price increases to the customer. We have the option to do that. But we also have the option to not pass the price and look for opportunity to really optimize for profit dollars. And I'll turn it to Mark and maybe Mark, if you have something to add on that. Mark McCaffrey : Yes. Thanks, Aman. One, just to enforce pricing for -- pricing wasn't an impact on Q3 for us, just as an FYI. When we do look at pricing, we are solving for gross profit. But if it comes to market share versus gross profit, we will go with market share. And we do not use any type of broad brush approach to pricing increases. We really look at it on a market-by-market basis. Nicholas Jones : Got it. And maybe if I could just follow up on the first question and maybe say it a different way. I think you've given a statistic that like 50% of people searching for a domain don't kind of find the handle they're looking for right away. So they may be tilted more towards the dotcom or are you able to kind of present more options with the handle they want that maybe ends up yielding more purchases and TLDs that you own. I guess I don't know if that kind of helps clarify where I was going with it next. Aman Bhutani : Yes. Nick, just to quickly respond to that, you're right. A lot of customers don't get the dotcom they're looking for because it's already taken, pizza.com, somebody's already got it. What we do is we're improving our search results more and more, where we use machine learning and AI to give the customer options, and those options include TLDs. And it's actually very specific to the search. So it's really not about what TLDs we might own. It's really about what the search is and then providing the customers high up on search as it makes sense with those options with different TLDs and letting the customer make the choice. Nicholas Jones : Great, thank you. Mark McCaffrey : Yes. And I'll just add to that, Aman. Aftermarket does help us present to them names that they might not be able to get otherwise. So it is driving some of our aftermarket growth as well. Nicholas Jones : Great, thanks. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Brent, please go ahead. Brent Thill : Great, thanks. As it just relates to the seasonality, I'm curious, it seems like to me -- you mentioned there's a rebound. I'm curious kind of when you think about the trajectory of this rebound? And can you may be put in context the -- historically what you're hearing from that side? And then I had a quick follow-up. Aman Bhutani : Sure, Brent. There a couple of data points here. We're looking at overall demand, sort of Google Search traffic as an example. And we're looking at how that's changing and evolving. And obviously, I know you have access to that data, too. But we parse it and we say, okay, is there a shift in the overall universe. And then we're looking at folks coming to our site, the gross customer ad and saying, okay, what percentage of that population is actually becoming customers for GoDaddy or approaching GoDaddy. So what do you see in the guide, the assumptions in it are around what we see over the last four, five months, and we see signals match up in the broader macro with our data. In terms of answering your question on what do we -- how does it compare to the past? Obviously, 2020 was a very large demand cycle, it was big cohorts and so on. So what we're really comparing against is 2019, and these demand signals are more in line with 2019 than 2020. Brent Thill : Okay. That's great. And just a quick follow-up on the financials. I mean, the delta between bookings and revenue, and I know there's a lot of factors, but it's never, I think, been this wide at 9% FX versus 13.5% on -- so what is the divergence? Why is it so large? And I know you mentioned they're going to converge. But why are we seeing that right now? Mark McCaffrey : I kind of look at it as a cycle. We are -- we saw a divergence. Now we're seeing a convergence come back the other way. And we do, like you said, expect them to equal out over time, and we're starting to see that happen now. But we had large cohorts last year. They went into our deferred revenue. They're being amortized out now. And as they're being replaced by smaller cohorts, it's going to result in that divergence you're seeing right now. Brent Thill : Great, thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Elliott from Morgan Stanley. Elizabeth, please go ahead. Elizabeth Elliott : Hi, thank you so much for questions. So I'll try to dig in a little bit on Payments and super helpful color on about 20% savings on fees versus other providers. Any color you could share with us and kind of the mix of new eligible users? How many of those are opting for GoDaddy Payments? Aman Bhutani : Thanks, Elizabeth. It's really too early to talk about new versus existing users. As you know, we did a big launch called OPEN 21 and attracted a lot of customers, 20,000 folks plus got to see it. We have thousands of folks engaged in detailed sessions where we talked about how to do their marketing, how to sort of manage their off-line and online portfolios and get into the big markets and platforms. So -- but it's all very, very early. And unfortunately, it's too early to comment on any specific numbers. Elizabeth Elliott : Got it, thank you. Mark McCaffrey : Elizabeth, I'll just add what we're seeing. We're really excited about it. And the great thing about launching a quarter early is we'll get to see data a quarter early. So we're really looking forward to adding some color on the Investor Day. Elizabeth Elliott : Great. And then just a quick follow-up for me on the Pro Hub. It's great to see kind of you're on track for that ambitious 300,000 goal on Pros. I know that the Hub itself is free. So any color you could provide on just the ability to grow the mix of Pros and attach kind of more products to those users in order to monetize the opportunity? Aman Bhutani : Yes. As you know, we have 1.5 million web Pros on our platform. Given the businesses we're in, we have access to a lot of these Pros. But we built the Hub so we could have engagement with them on a regular basis, give them ways to save them time, giving them ways to be able to do their jobs better and focus on growing customers and their business. The Pros focus on WordPress, that's what the hub is all about optimizing their experience there. And ultimately, what we're looking for is to get a bigger share of wallet with GoDaddy forum. We know Pros support lots of multi-sites. They have a percentage with us, and we know it's a very, very large opportunity for us to get a piece of the rest. Other places that where you'll see some monetization experiments, of course, we launched Invoicing. So that's a good tool. It creates lots of stickiness, but it also creates some economics. We're also experimenting with special offers within the Hub. So where we can try to see what encourages Pros to sort of buy something with GoDaddy versus something else. And just it's -- the idea there is let's try to share with them and say, hey, if you sell this product, we'll give you a piece of it. Those are the types of experiments you'll see, and those also create economics for us. Elizabeth Elliott : Great, thank you very much for color. Aman Bhutani : Thank you. Christie Masoner : Next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Sterling, please go ahead. Sterling Auty : Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. So I'm curious if you could give us some color geographically on the trends that you talked about. So in other words, the sluggishness that's turning into improving signs back to 2019, how does that look in the U.S. versus Europe versus Brazil, et cetera? Aman Bhutani : Thanks, Sterling. It truly follows sort of the COVID arc that we've talked about in the past and likely UC as well. The demand environment that I talked about actually covered U.S. and international and we see a lot of similarities. Having said that, in certain geos, there is a bigger impact from COVID, and we see demand bounce around a little bit in those geos. But overall, in the GoDaddy portfolio, that's small. So if I look at the overall portfolio, there isn't really 1 geo to specifically call out as having any significant impact. And broadly, the trends are similar. Sterling Auty : All right. Great. And then one follow-up on the Payments side. You mentioned being given the opportunity to experiment with pricing. So is that to mean that the lowest pricing that you just announced is something that's kind of a test bed and could fluctuate? Or what is it that you want to experiment with? Aman Bhutani : Sterling, the pricing that we announced, the 2.3% plus $0.00 in-store and 2.3% plus $0.30 online, that's the pricing for Payments. But as you know, we have a lot of opportunity to build SKUs and bundles, including new value for these. So the experimentation that we'll be looking at is new SKUs that offer the full suite where customers get the force bang, if you will, and how do we price those things when we bundle things differently, the pricing for the hardware, those are the areas that you'll see us experiment more. Sterling Auty : Excellent, thank you. Aman Bhutani : Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Trevor Young from Barclays. Trevor, please go ahead. Trevor Young : Well, I think we might have lost Trevor. So Naved, if you are available, Naved Khan from Truist, please go ahead. Naved Khan : Yes, thank you. Can you hear me okay? Christie Masoner : We can. Naved Khan : Great. So with $20 billion in GMV kind of going through Poynt, maybe can you just touch on the opportunity to maybe gradually maybe move over some of this on your own rails GoDaddy Payments versus the legacy? And what are the things you can -- what are the different levers you can pull to do that? Aman Bhutani : Thanks, Naved. As you know, Poynt built its customer base, predominantly through channel partners, and those channel partners have banks want to use their rails for payments. But what that GMV does show is customer success. That customers at a very large scale are having a lot of success using this tool set. And obviously, our thesis of having Poynt be a part of GoDaddy is about us selling direct to customers, right? So I would look at that $20 billion as customer success and over time, more and more GPV flowing directly as we sell directly to customers. Naved Khan : Got it. And then a quick follow-up, if I may. If I just look at marketing efficiency, it seems like it improved sequentially. Any changes that you might have made to a channel mix? Or how should we just kind of think about this going forward? Aman Bhutani : Yes. Overall, we are happy with the returns on our marketing spend. And what you're really seeing here is over the last year, as demand was very high, we wanted to maintain share of voice. We wanted to lean into that demand. And as the demand came down, we didn't want to pull back on marketing so hard that we actually pull demand down for ourselves. So we let the demand pull the marketing spend down. You're seeing some of that in the efficiency. You're also seeing some optimizations across channels, but no specific comment on channels that we're doing more on or less on. Overall, our demand profile, especially in the way we get bookings broadly remains the same. Mark McCaffrey : I'll add to that, Naved. We expect it to be flat for Q4, just in case we're asking that question as well. Naved Khan : That's helpful. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Trevor Young from Barclays. Trevor, please go ahead. Trevor Young : Great, thanks. Just two, if I may, on Payments. First acknowledging that it's kind of early days, can you talk about the initial adoption on Payments, feedback on the POS devices? What seems to be resonating well with merchants versus maybe what needs some refinement? And then Mark, your comments were helpful on the margin profile. It sounds like maybe lower gross margin, but higher overall OMs over time. But can you help us unpack the fees there, like in terms of interchange fees, fraud and security, other cost of revenue lines and then OpEx and opportunities for savings there as it scales? Thank you. Aman Bhutani : Thanks, Trevor. On Payments, the feedback on the products has been positive. One thing I talked about previously, if you remember, we had introduced just GoDaddy Payments. I'm not talking about Omnicommerce, GoDaddy Payments in the Websites + Marketing flow. And we had shared that we've seen good adoption from customers on Payments. We continue to see good adoption there. So we know that it's been holding over the last few months. And in terms of other numbers related to OmniCommerce, the devices are getting shipped all over the U.S. So you'll see them soon. But it's really too early to comment on specifics, except that the customer feedback is good. Mark McCaffrey : And Trevor, I'll just add, without getting into the breakdown of some of that pricing. Just a couple of data points. One, we don't plan to lose money on the hardware and the payments. And our expectation, although we'll see a little bit of margin pressure at the gross level, it should be accretive to our normalized EBITDA going forward. Trevor Young : Great, thank you, guys. Christie Masoner : Thank you for joining us today. I will turn it over to Aman for closing remarks. Aman Bhutani : Thank you, Christie. I'll just end with thanking you for joining. We appreciate your questions. I look forward to engaging with you over time and seeing you at our Investor Day in February. A quick thank you to all the GoDaddy teams. A lot goes on for us to be able to deliver these strong results in the quarter, and a big thank you to everyone at GoDaddy. Thank you very much.",

    "content": "\ufeff Christie Masoner : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for GoDaddy's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2021 Earnings Call. I'm Christie Masoner, Senior Director of Investor Relations. And with me today are Aman Bhutani, Chief Executive Officer; and Mark McCaffrey, Chief Financial Officer. [Operator Instructions] On today's call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and operating metrics such as total bookings, unlevered free cash flow, normalized EBITDA, annualized recurring revenue, or ARR; gross merchandise volume, or GMV; and net debt. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalence may be found in the presentation posted to investors.godaddy.net or on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC with today's earnings release. The matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements, which include those related to our future financial results, our strategies are objective with respect to future operations, including our approach to capital allocation; new product introductions and innovations; and our ability to integrate acquisitions and achieve desired synergies. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, February 10, 2022, and except to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.  With that, here's Aman. Aman Bhutani : Thank you, Christie, and thank you all for joining us today. At GoDaddy, we remain laser-focused on helping micro and small business owners succeed and grow their businesses. Our customers continue to show resilience and creativity through the pandemic, and our Q4 financial results were a strong end to a strong year. As we look back at 2021, I am excited by the unyielding acceleration in the pace of execution, best demonstrated by the integration of Poynt and the launch of the OmniCommerce offering. And we have a deep trust with our 21 million customers, evidenced by the 65-plus NPS we have in care and that in Q4, more than 60% of customers in the commerce tier of Websites + Marketing chose GoDaddy Payments over other established providers. We delivered strong growth in bookings, revenue and unlevered free cash flow in 2021, with Q4 being GoDaddy's first quarter of $1 billion in revenue. We ended the year with a significant outperformance in aftermarket, driven by sustained market demand. We continue to drive broad-based strength in our Create and Grow suite of products with ARR for them growing 19% year-over-year. And today, we announced a $3 billion share buyback program that Mark will cover in his section. While we delivered strong financial results, Omicron impacted our customers and our employees. In the U.S., the impact started to show late in the quarter as customer demand softened a little bit, and more and more employees were out sick due to the pandemic. As you might expect, the biggest operational impact of the higher absentee rates were in our care organization. As Omicron cases around the world have come down, we have seen better staffing in care and expect the impacts of Omicron to be limited to Q1 2022. Early this year, we named Roger Chen as our Chief Operating Officer. Roger has been with GoDaddy for over 6.5 years and led teams to strong financial results by focusing on operational excellence. He started with GoDaddy with the expansion of our international footprint and most recently, has been leading our Domains business. Roger is excited to meet you at our Investor Day tomorrow. With Roger's appointment, I am happy to share that we have a well-rounded and complete executive leadership team in place, and we are excited about the large opportunity in front of GoDaddy and confident in our ability to execute to him. As always, I will cover progress on our top 3 priorities today. Our top priority continues to be driving success in commerce through Presence. A year into the Poynt acquisition, we have made remarkable progress with the integration, kudos to all the teams involved. We completed several product launches for Websites + Marketing and Managed WordPress, launching GoDaddy Payments midyear and the OmniCommerce product launch in September. We also recently launched a higher-end commerce SKU, which is currently being tested with a percentage of U.S. customers. We doubled the size of our Commerce team, and we intend to continue the rapid pace of product launches in 2022 as well. With the launch of our OmniCommerce offering in September, we took a giant step forward in our ability to serve our customers with a seamlessly intuitive experience. Our customers' need is to sell anything anywhere. And we are all in the early stages of the merging of the off-line and online Commerce experience, and we call this Connected Commerce.  We're pleased to share that right out of the gate, we're seeing some good early signs. Since the launch, we have sold over 1,000 point-of-sale devices and have received tens of thousands of GoDaddy Payments applications from customers. Most promising is that customers are choosing GoDaddy Payments in Websites + Marketing commerce tier, more than 60% of customers are choosing GoDaddy Payments. And in Managed WordPress where customers have over 140 choices, nearly 1/4 of customers are already choosing GoDaddy Payments. We're pleased to already be at this level of attach. We have also rapidly expanded our partnerships with Google, Facebook and Instagram to increase our customers' reach and boost their online profile. These integrations are making a real difference for our customers. Most of our customers double their website traffic when running a Facebook or Instagram ad. Additionally, GoDaddy Websites + Marketing customers who added their stores to social media, saw at least 2x increase in number of customers placing orders. Our customers' commerce needs are increasingly interconnected to the various different ways they show up. Recognizing this customer need, we have expanded our focus from online presence to what we call ubiquitous presence, which we'll discuss in more detail tomorrow. We know how and where customers show up is important to the way they connect with their customers, and GoDaddy has the solutions customers need. 1/3 of our customers link their websites to at least 1 social platform. And in Q4, we added the ability for customers to link their sites to 3 new social platforms, TikTok, Twitch & Discord. Since then, these new platforms account for 11% of all platforms that customers link from their websites with TikTok being the most popular. Another customer need is Biosites. Biosites have become an essential tool for our social first customers. And we're excited to support them through the launch of Social Site, GoDaddy Studios bio site capability. Consistent with our goal of meeting customers where they are, this tool empowers social-first entrepreneurs to set up a fantastic Social Site with GoDaddy Studios with just a few clicks, helping them grow their business by driving traffic to their top content. Our customers' customers are reaching them through many channels, chat on website, SMS, Facebook Messenger and much more. Having to check and respond to these various different channels is cumbersome and time consuming. With the acquisition of Re :amaze we quickly enabled a unified messaging inbox called Conversations in Websites + Marketing. It pulls in messages from a customer's website, Facebook Messenger, Instagram inbox and voice line, all into 1 convenient inbox. Customers can easily access, organize and respond to messages from multiple platforms fall in 1 place and never miss a sales opportunity. This feature is also available via mobile app for convenient access to messages on the go. This saves small business customers time, and they can quickly help their customers or enable automated chat bots that can help answer questions about order updates, shipping and more. And customers are already showing that they love it. Usage for the conversations feature jumped immediately, and we expect more and more Websites + Marketing customers to use this feature over the next few months. Our present solutions continue to be priced competitively, giving us short-term pricing opportunity and with higher customer engagement with features like conversations, we continue to build greater consumer surplus, which we expect will offer pricing opportunities in the future as well. The increased pace of execution here is also showing in our results. Across our Create and Grow products, Websites + Marketing, Managed WordPress, Sellbrite and GoDaddy Studios, ARR grew to $410 million in 2021, an increase of approximately 19% year-over-year. We measure and share this metric as we believe it is indicative of future success in GoDaddy's high-growth areas and where we are funding innovation and capturing higher value customers. Moving on to our second priority, GoDaddy Pros. As you are aware, we have a large number of Pros over 1.5 million in our customer base, a majority of them in our hosting business. Pros widely prefer WordPress, and we are committed to supporting them and supporting WordPress. More deeply engaging our Pro customer base continues to be one of the large opportunities in front of us, and we are working on exactly that. While we set and achieve an aggressive goal to register 300,000 Pros in our Pro Hub, we quickly shifted our focus to a steady set of feature launches driving monthly active users, or MAU. In Q4, we launched priority care ticketing, commission-based incentives, percent-based pricing for new reseller customers, client reports and more in the Hub. While it's early days on these new launches, all of these features demonstrate our commitment to provide a differentiated experience to our Pro customers, increasing the value we create for them. Our Pros customers use both Managed WordPress and hosting products with us. As Pros show greater preference for Managed WordPress, delivering the best experience across both is key to our relationship with them. In 2021, we started to upgrade the Hosting platform to a new optimized configuration, which has started to show significant performance improvements. Notably, a 37% average improvement in server response times, improved NPS and a resulting 6% increase in renewal rates over a couple of quarters. And with our continued efforts to integrate Pagely, we will provide them with the best Managed WordPress offering for their customers as well. Our third priority is innovating in Domains. Our aftermarket business posted another remarkable quarter, led by significant market demand as we exited the year, driving increases in both the volume and size of transactions. While primary Domain Registrars growth remained solid, GoDaddy Registry successfully launched a Reputation Protection Solution contributing to strong growth in the Registry business. We also extended our Registry offering by winning the bid to be the exclusive issuer of .tv TLDs. The Domains business continues to be one of our most valued assets as it often serves as our first introduction to our customers while providing a significant launching Poynt to attach other products. We will share more on this at our Investor Day tomorrow.  Lastly, I wanted to highlight some key wins on the marketing front as a preview for some of the content in tomorrow's Investor Day. One of the areas of investment for us over the last year was the GoDaddy website. The team had set its sights on conversion improvement as the goal and by building and following a world-class experimentation-based software development approach, they realize meaningful incremental growth. We know that once a customer gets to our site, that's only the beginning. And our teams continue to work on continued improvement in engagement and conversion. We've also been working hard at spending marketing dollars more efficiently. Over the last few months with new leadership in place, we embarked on a journey to add advanced testing and measurement capabilities to make faster decisions on our marketing spend, strengthening our talent and execution in areas like data science has been key for us to be able to better discover opportunities for marketing efficiency and do the tests needed to understand incrementality even if it means turning off a channel for a couple of weeks. Fara will cover this area tomorrow at our Investor Day, and I continue to be excited to leverage our marketing spend more effectively. I also wanted to take a moment to welcome you to our Investor Day tomorrow. We will discuss our long-term strategy, innovation initiatives, refreshed capital allocation strategy, go-forward revenue presentation and 3-year guide. We are eager to spend additional time with all of you tomorrow. In closing, we're pleased with the results this quarter and with GoDaddy's progress against our key initiatives. We're delighted that the momentum in our biggest product release yet and even more delighted that our customers are demonstrating an appetite for it through the early signals of adoption. We are committed to continuing our pace of innovation, bringing important innovative solutions to customers, driving progress across the entire industry and delivering durable top line profitable growth, robust cash flow with a focus on disciplined capital allocation.  With that, here's Mark. Mark McCaffrey : Thanks, Aman, and hello. I am looking forward to connecting with everyone over the next 2 days. Today, I'll first touch on 2021 full year and fourth quarter financial results as well as an outlook for 2022. Tomorrow, at our Investor Day, I'll provide additional long-term guidance and introduce our new revenue disclosures and metrics. With that, let's move to our 2021 results. Total revenue for 2021 grew 15% year-over-year to $3.8 billion, exceeding our initial guidance on broad-based strength in new and renewal revenue attach and outperformance in our aftermarket. ARPU increased 10% to 182, and we added 600,000 net new customers in 2021 with continued strong retention and renewal rates. Moving on to our quarterly results. GoDaddy achieved a new quarterly revenue milestone of $1 billion, up 17% year-over-year, exceeding our guidance. International revenue grew 13% on a reported basis with approximately 1 point of currency tailwind. Q4 Domains revenue increased 24% year-over-year to $497 million. Aftermarket was the primary driver of the strength in Domains contributing nearly 2/3 of the growth in this line, with the remainder attributable to acceleration in GoDaddy Registry and continued strong new registrations and renewals. Hosting and Presence revenue grew 7% year-over-year to $330 million in the fourth quarter. We continued to drive growth in our Create and Grow products with legacy hosting and security growing low single digits.  Q4 Hosting and Presence, Create and Grow ARR surpassed $410 million, growing 19% year-over-year. Within that suite, Q4 Websites + Marketing ARR grew 20% year-over-year. And more specifically, Websites + Marketing Commerce ARR grew 24%, demonstrating our Commerce opportunity in Websites + Marketing. As Commerce becomes more pronounced in our products, we'll continue to evolve this disclosure as we have multiple paths of growth for Commerce and more products in our suite. Lastly, annualized GMV across the GoDaddy ecosystem was approximately $26 billion in 2021, growing 21% year-over-year. Business Applications revenue increased 18% year-over-year to $192 million on continued strength in branded e-mail and productivity solutions as customers continue to attach add seats and up-level their solutions. Bookings grew to $1.1 billion, improving 11% year-over-year on a reported and constant currency basis. Growth was broad-based with continued strength across product categories, including strength in aftermarket. Gross margin was down slightly in the low end of the mid-60s for the quarter. Product mix, particularly strength in aftermarket, continues to drive the company's overall gross margin. Investment in tech and dev was consistent with last quarter as we continue to accelerate our pace of innovation while maintaining fiscal discipline. We continue to get leverage in G&A as travel and other office expenses remain below historical levels. One item to note is that during Q4, we continued the consolidation of our Arizona offices, resulting in a closure of 1 office and a $15 million onetime charge in our restructuring and other line. This offset the $15 million gain recognized last quarter from the sale of another Arizona office as we continue to simplify our physical footprint. As Aman noted earlier, we drove efficiency in our marketing spend, although our investment remained strong in Q4 and consistent with Q3. Year-over-year saw a deceleration in our spend as we lapped the elevated investment we made in 2020 to capture the extraordinary demand. As we continue to refine our marketing return engine, we remain focused adjusting our marketing spend as macro environments fluctuate. Our growth and investment in the fourth quarter resulted in normalized EBITDA of $254 million, representing growth of 29% year-over-year from continued profitability, disciplined hiring and leveraging OpEx as we continue to benefit from work at home and decreased travel. Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter was $203 million, growing 12% year-over-year. Full year unlevered free cash flow grew 16% year-over-year to $960 million, in line with our guidance. Positive working capital impacts as well as reduced capital expenditures for corporate real estate and infrastructure was offset by the lower margin profile of our top line outperformance. On the balance sheet, we exited the year with $1.3 billion in cash and total liquidity of nearly $1.9 billion. Net debt landed at $2.7 billion, below 3x net leverage on a trailing 12-month basis and near the midpoint of our targeted range of 2 to 4x. The strength and resilience of our recurring business model have fueled a strong balance sheet, enabling us to address our capital allocation priorities. In 2021, we completed 6 acquisitions and repurchased nearly 4% of our outstanding equity. In addition, today, we announced our intent to buy back $3 billion of shares through 2024. This represents utilization of approximately 80% of our projected free cash flow over the next 3 years and is expected to drive a material reduction in our share count. We also announced we expect to launch a $750 million ASR this quarter, which shows our commitment to aggressive use of the new $3 billion repurchase authorization. We are committed to increasing the value we create for shareholders by growing our free cash flow and reducing our share count over time. Now I'd like to provide our outlook for 2022. We expect total annual revenue to be within a range of $4.14 billion to $4.16 billion, which represents year-over-year growth of 9% at the midpoint of the range. In Q1 2022, we are targeting total revenue of $985 million to $990 million. This represents 10% growth at the midpoint of the range. We expect 2022 unlevered free cash flow of approximately $1.1 billion or 15% growth versus 2021. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $65 million, income tax payments of approximately $20 million and cash interest payments of approximately $120 million. The global pandemic has affected a lot of businesses in SMBs, the time line of which has varied by market, geography and customer type. Because of this variability forward-looking guidance based on years that were impacted or benefited by COVID can be challenging. As such, it's important to call out that guidance we're providing today shows continued business momentum. Yet comes off a strong year of outperformance in 2021, which makes for tough comps in the near term. Tomorrow at Investor Day, we will discuss multiyear growth targets and levers, which provide a better picture of the potential we see and the shareholder value it will create. We are committed to providing the information you need to model the business confidently, value the business effectively and hold us accountable for executing against our stated objectives. In addition to incremental disclosures and metrics, we will spend our time with you tomorrow discussing the company's long-term strategy, key innovation initiatives and updated capital allocation strategy and as I mentioned, a multiyear outlook. We'll end the day with Q&A hosted by our management team. Given we have Investor Day tomorrow, we ask that you limit questions today to our 2021 results and the information we've provided in our prepared remarks. We have ample information to share with you tomorrow, and we will have time to go into more details then. With that, I'll hand the call over to Christie Masoner, who will be leading the Q&A Christie Masoner : Thanks, Mark. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Trevor Young from Barclays. Trevor Young : Great. First, on Domains in 4Q. Obviously, sizable outperformance relative to the commentary last quarter, which I think was pointing to low double-digit growth. What drove the strength in aftermarket as I think the expectation was that there were some tailwinds that started in 4Q of '20 from new inventory unlock that were sort of expected to abate? And then specifically within core Domains, was there better retention or an uptick in new registrations? Or was most of the incremental growth there from the Reputation Protection Solution service that you launched? Mark McCaffrey : Thanks, Trevor, and good to see you. Good to hear from you. Just real quick on the outperformance in looking at aftermarket. We couldn't be more excited at the momentum we're seeing in the marketplace today around our aftermarket. As we exited the year, we saw an uptick in both volume and average deal size and we exited with deals that we're pacing at a great momentum. Just a reminder, it's a transactional business. So the sales cycle is short on those, so our visibility out in any period can be limited. But we're going to talk about it a little bit more tomorrow, but we couldn't be more excited at the momentum as we continue to see great demand in the market related to the platform. On Domains, we saw strength across the board. Customer retention rates remain strong. We also had added benefit from the Registry items that we noted. So when I look at it across the quarter, it's broad-based, clearly driven by aftermarket was the big pickup, but we saw strength across the board. Trevor Young : That's really helpful. And just a quick follow-up, if I may. On the 3% customer growth throughout the year, can you just talk about how that trended in 4Q versus earlier in the year? I think Aman noted some maybe softness later in the quarter related to Omicron. And then have you seen that improvement in customer demand kind of uptick? Aman Bhutani : Yes, I'm happy to jump in on that, Trevor. Yes, as I noted in the prepared remarks, Omicron did have a slight demand impact. And it has continued going into January as well. But as I said, we expect that sort of be limited to Q1 of 2022 in terms of impact. Just reflecting on the full year of 2021, as you might expect, sort of the growth was a reflection of the sort of outperformance in 2022 -- in 2020, given just the huge forward we had a 1.4 million net new customers in 2020. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Clarke Jeffries from Piper Sandler. Q \u2013 Clarke Jeffries : First one is just maybe a reflection on what's resonating most with those customers that are adopting GoDaddy Payments. A little surprised to see nearly 25% of Managed WordPress customers convert. Just wondering if you had any kind of insights on what was the reason for them choosing GoDaddy? And what method was the sort of outreach or communication with those customers to kind of prompt the conversion? Aman Bhutani : Yes. Thanks, Clarke. Just to clarify, when we talk about Managed WordPress customers and 25 percentage is the customer sort of signing up for Commerce tier and 25% of them are choosing GoDaddy Payments over the 140 options they have in Managed WordPress today, and we're super excited about it. And in terms of what's driving that, we continue to have a team that is focused on sort of surfacing GoDaddy Payments, making sure customers see it, they understand what we're offering. And of course, we have really competitive pricing in the market. We think we're at a price point that is attractive for our customers that allows us to reach customers in a manner that sort of breaks through the other players, and that's been helpful for us. Clarke Jeffries : Great. And then maybe one follow-up. Certainly encouraging to see the appetite to invest in the Commerce effort, both on the product side and the people side. I was particularly interested in the testing of a higher-end SKU for the commerce tier. I was wondering if you could help frame the sleeve of the market that you see as the opportunity for that higher-end solution, maybe bracket where you would like to go with that SKU? Aman Bhutani : Yes. We'll actually cover it quite -- in quite a lot of detail tomorrow, so I won't sort of cover it all today. But just as we talked about it a little bit, we're bringing a lot more value to the table with the integration of Poynt. Customer with GoDaddy now can not only sell sort of in their online stores, sell on the major platforms or on social media and in their physical store. We have a number of things like the Commerce Hub that bring it all together and make it very, very simple. So what we're doing is packaging up the best of that into a higher-end SKU. It's actually now available in the U.S. If you go to the website, you may not see. But if you try a few times, you will because it's sort of being AB test right now to see what sort of adoption we get for that higher-end SKU. But I will touch on more sort of related to Commerce and why we're so excited about Connected Commerce tomorrow. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Jo-Ann Lee from Evercore ISI. Jo- Ann Lee : Just the -- I guess follow-up on the kind of the Q1 outlook where you said that you expect the Omnicon impact to be limited in Q1. If you can talk a little bit more about what gives you confidence about that projection? Is there anything that you're seeing that kind of is pointing in the right direction? And if there's any color around the segment growth assumptions you can share? And where we could see upside to that full year guide? Aman Bhutani : Yes. Thanks, Jo-Ann. Let me take the first part, and I'll turn the second over to Mark. On Omicron what the data we're looking at is both sort of across the world, the number of cases. And you know those charts as well as we do. And a little bit of our experience over the last 2 years, where if you remember a couple of years ago, as COVID started for a couple of quarters, we had talked about the COVID Arc whereas we saw cases increase, we saw sort of shifts in customer behavior and demand. And we think we're seeing something similar here where with the rise of Omicron, we see it in our own employee base, too, especially with care employees. And as cases have come down, our expectation is that things will sort of get back to normal, if you will. And Mark, I'll turn the second part over to you. Mark McCaffrey : Yes. Thanks, Aman. I'll ask it, we're going to talk a lot about segments tomorrow and some of our repositioning of our product pillars. So hang on tight with that question, if that's okay. I don't want to give away the lead story tomorrow. Having said that, on the upside, right, we couldn't have been more thrilled with the upside we saw in the market around aftermarket. And as I mentioned previously, it is a transactional business with a short sales cycle, and we're seeing great momentum in both volume and average deal size because it's transactional, it can provide some upside going forward. Now we don't have line of sight to that, and that's generally how we guide. But in answer to your question, we're excited about the upside there. Jo- Ann Lee : Great. If I may, just a quick follow-up on just the marketing. It looks like there's a little bit of marketing leverage this quarter. I know you guys talked about and probably we'll talk more about the marketing efficiency efforts. Is that mostly what's driving the leverage this quarter? Or if you can talk through the marketing spend environment, the CAC trend for Q4 and maybe Q1? Aman Bhutani : Yes. Let me touch on sort of the approach to marketing overall, Jo-Ann, and then maybe perhaps Mark can just touch on the leverage sort of across the other line items. Our approach to marketing over the last couple of years has been that when the demand was high, we wanted to make sure we lean into that demand. We wanted to make sure the customer we've maintained our share of voice and customers knew that GoDaddy had entered into Commerce. And we'll actually share more on that topic with you tomorrow as well. But as demand came down, we wanted to sort of bring the spend down with it, but not too fast. We didn't want to drag demand down for GoDaddy. So you saw us sort of bring that the demand -- the spend down as the demand came down. And in terms of leverage on the line items, I don't know, Mark, if you could just talk about that for a moment. Mark McCaffrey : Yes. And the great thing about our model and our durable revenue and our ability to generate cash is we can do so great attach, increasing ARPU and get better leverage because our business is sticky. And we continue to see that in marketing. We continue to see that in care. As our relationships grow, our ability to upsell and cross-sell, just get easier and we get better leverage out of it.  On top of that, we will continue to get leverage out of G&A. As we look to simplify our footprint, we're investing a lot in moving to the cloud. So again, the thing I love about our operating model is it flexible to agile and it creates a lot of leverage for us to both return cash to our shareholders as well as invest in durable growth. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Ygal Arounian from Wedbush. Ygal Arounian : I guess, Aman, you mentioned getting back to normal after COVID. So even after kind of the Omicron wave or outside of that, there's been investor concern just in the space broadly about demand, the demands have been pulled forward that overall demand levels are not just this year, but over the coming years, might be different. We've seen the kind of the new business application numbers come back down to normal. Whether just it's framed within the outlook or just kind of overall, how do you see the normal? What is the new normal? And what should we expect? I'm sure we'll touch on it tomorrow. It's kind of hard to parse out the long term from this. But maybe framed within the guidance, and then I have one follow-up. Aman Bhutani : Yes. I'll let Mark touch on the guidance, but Ygal, you asked a very hard question. And as you framed it yourself, no crystal ball to really be able to say how the demand looks or how the pandemic continues to impact demand or small businesses. I think the way we're looking at it is that 2020 was just a unique year. It was very, very different. And for multiple quarters, seasonality disappeared from the business, and every quarter was a bit different and very hard to look at. Now we tend to see more and more data points what I'll call normal seasonality is back in the business. And of course, it's going to be very hard to sort of see demand at the 2020 levels as a lot of companies saw. But the way -- when I say normal, what I mean is the normal seasonality pattern a bit more predictable demand that we are used to expecting in our business. Ygal Arounian : Okay. And then on the follow-up, I just want to make sure I understand the Payments adoption correctly. So are you saying at 60% of new Commerce hubs that are taking GoDaddy Payments? How should we think about that on renewals and kind of what the pace of overall adoption has been or what it can be? Aman Bhutani : Yes, Ygal, we should absolutely see those as new customers coming to GoDaddy, going through Websites + Marketing or Managed WordPress and the rate at which they're adopting GoDaddy Payments, right? But we -- it's too early to talk about our existing base. We do think we have an amazing product, GoDaddy Payments. We have great pricing, a great brand and there's an opportunity with our existing customers, but it's too early to talk about renewal cycle or things like that. We're literally almost like 6 months into GoDaddy Payments. So it's very, very early. Ygal Arounian : Okay. We should think in another 6 months is the kind of first big renewal cycle where people might start picking up GoDaddy Payments to previous customers. Aman Bhutani : When we do have more on it, Yigal, we'll definitely share a little bit with you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Elliott from Morgan Stanley. Elizabeth Elliott : Congrats on the strong quarter. I don't want to dig in on the monetization per user. We got the customer count for the first time. And in a year and overall ARPU growth was pretty impressive. So I wanted to get some color on what type of uplift you're seeing in spend per customer and any trends to call out in the behavior of how new customers are landing versus kind of the existing customer base expanding? Aman Bhutani : Yes, I'm happy to jump in first on that, Elizabeth. When we think about overall customer, just to take the last part of your question, new customers, we continue to see -- if you take the sort of 2-year cycle instead of the 1-year cycle, I would say we see very consistent patterns with new customers. And we're particularly happy with the ARPU growth. It is a bit accelerated versus previous years. And we're very happy to see it. Our goal, of course, is to continue to maintain that type of ARPU growth. That's why we have the higher-priced products, the greater offering with Commerce. And we will touch on this tomorrow as well to just show you, again, the lifetime value of the customer as we attach more products with them, especially as we get into Commerce and how that opens up a bit more of the TAM for GoDaddy. Mark McCaffrey : Yes. And I'll just add to that, Elizabeth, good to talk about again. Couldn't be more thrilled with the customer adds and the ARPU and the momentum. Really excited just showing the durability of the model and the strength of it going forward and the predictability of the revenue and the cash flow that we'll have into the future to invest and return to shareholders. Elizabeth Elliott : Got it. And then I just wanted a quick follow-up on Omicron that you highlighted, the headwind kind of limited to more Q1. Any color on you guys that Omicron impact to the Q1 guidance? Or any other headwinds, tailwinds like FX to call up to the growth in Q1? Aman Bhutani : Nothing more to add on the Omicron piece, Elizabeth, versus what I just already shared in terms of what we see in the cases, what we see in our employee base. We have the benefit of having a very large care organization that gets a lot of calls from customers. So we get a little bit, if you will, color on how people are feeling or doing. So that's what our estimate is based on. And in terms of FX, maybe Mark, you could weigh on that. Mark McCaffrey : Yes, absolutely. And I think we're comfortable with the guidance that we're giving out here. We've seen the Omicron hit in January with our care, like Aman mentioned. We think it's limited. Obviously, we can't predict any other variants or other things happening out there for the quarter. But I think we're very comfortable right now with where we're pegging Q1. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Brent Thill : Just on use of capital, you're committing to a fairly large buyback in the ASR. I guess when you think about just the overall ability to do tactical M&A, can you give us a sense of is the buyback to the way given how significant that commitment is? Or are you leaving yourself enough wiggle room to do some tuck-in M&A going forward? Mark McCaffrey : Brent, perfect question, right? I would say we're going to get into the capital allocation strategy tomorrow. But one of the great things about our model, just leading up tomorrow is we have the ability to generate a lot of cash because of our predictability and bearability, but also look at other items that can accelerate growth and grow our business over the long term. So as I think I said in Q3, very much and versus an or for us and looking forward to getting the details of how we're thinking about that moving forward tomorrow. Brent Thill : Great. And Aman, when you think about some of the new product features, there's -- you've given -- there's a lot of great innovation. I guess when you think about kind of the 1 or 2 areas that you're most excited by, can you just give us your sense, we understand you love all your products equally, but 1 or 2 is standing out to you? Aman Bhutani : Yes. I'm particularly excited about our top priority, which is Commerce and bringing Commerce to every surface that we have, Brent. You will see that tomorrow, I have picked at least 1 idea that I'm particularly excited about. So I go into a bit of detail. I won't showcase it now, but suffice to say that just bringing Commerce to every surface of the company is what I'm most excited about. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Sterling Auty from JP Morgan. Drew Glaeser : This is Drew on for Sterling. Revisiting the OmniCommerce solution, I was wondering if you could speak to the trends you're seeing in customer behavior more specifically in the split between shopping in-store versus online? Aman Bhutani : Yes. Thanks, Drew. It's a bit too early to be giving our numbers on the OmniCommerce solution. We did share that we shipped -- we've got over 1,000 orders of point of sale. So definitely, customers are starting to realize that we have this solution and that they're excited to adopt it, but it's too early to be talking about split in terms of what we're seeing. We need a few more quarters of data and before we could talk about that. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe Research. Deepak Mathivanan : Can you hear me? Christie Masoner : Yes Deepak Mathivanan : So just a couple of questions, and apologies if this was already addressed. On that $40 million outperformance on the aftermarket side in Domains, was the contribution to fourth quarter bookings roughly the same because I mean if I exclude that, it seems like bookings were up like 7%, is that math accurate? Can you help with what are the factors of deceleration, if that's accurate? And then also related to that, on the first quarter guide, how should we think about this aftermarket contribution? And that you have factored into revenues? And then also maybe some color on bookings would be great? Mark McCaffrey : Yes. A couple of things. On -- just on the aftermarket part of it, and I'll try to bridge this from Q4 to Q1. It's a transactional business. So it impacts both bookings and revenue when it's recorded, but does not impact deferred revenue at the end of any given period. So it can provide upside in any given quarter, but does not have a what I'd call deferred revenue impact in future periods. So our visibility into any given quarter could provide variability. On the deferred revenue, I would say we're coming off of 2020 cohorts that were very large and we're coming into 2021 cohorts that are a little smaller. So we're seeing the deferred revenue balances come down based on that trend, but that's generally what you're seeing out there. Deepak Mathivanan : Got it. If I can just follow up on that. So should we expect this trend to also continue in 2022? Mark McCaffrey : So Deepak, I would say we're seeing great momentum in 2022 when it relates to continuing to grow our business and provide durable revenue. We are excited about the momentum of the aftermarket, but it's still early stage for us to see that momentum and the variability will have from quarter-to-quarter. We are extraordinarily excited at the volume of the transactions going up, the average deal size going up. So we expect some momentum. But like I said, it can vary from quarter-to-quarter. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau from William Blair. Matt Pfau : First wanted to ask for 2022 if it'd be possible if you could give us some direction on how you're thinking about the growth by your 3 different revenue line items? Aman Bhutani : Matt, I'm going to give you the -- hey, can we wait until tomorrow. We're disclosing some new information on how we're going to be describing our revenue pillars going forward, and I think that will be able to answer your questions. Matt Pfau : Okay. Great. And then to follow up on some of the previous questions about ARPU and customer growth. If we look prior to the pandemic, your overall revenue growth was kind of split evenly between customer growth and ARPU. And then obviously, the last 2 years have been not normal. How are you thinking about the split between those 2 drivers as we move forward here? Aman Bhutani : Matt, the way I think about it, and Aman can add on to me the way I think about it is we have great opportunities going forward coming out of the pandemic, both to attract new customers as well as upsell our existing customer base. And while we don't get into which one is going to provide more, we think both create an exceptional opportunity for us to continue to grow the business at a durable rate which we've shown over time we can do. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Naved Khan from Truist. Naved Khan : Can you hear me? Mark McCaffrey : Yes. Naved Khan : So I just wanted to touch on the inflationary environment there in and how we think -- how you are thinking about the additional pressures on your P&L as well as maybe your ability to cut asset on to your customer base? And then secondarily, just on e-commerce, I think last year, Aman, I think you spoke about maybe 1/4 of your new customer kind of customers being an e-commerce customer. Is that still the case? Is that mix holding up? Or -- has it kind of come back down to more normal levels or maybe even gone up? Mark McCaffrey : I'll take the first part of that, and maybe Aman, you can take the second part of that, the inflationary comment. Obviously, we're living in interesting times with inflations, and we saw a lot in the press today. The fallback I always look at it is, hey, we have a very durable model that has been around for a while, and we've seen the ups and the downs, and we've been able to continue to generate growth, continue to move forward. So we'll see what the ultimate impact in the macro is around inflation, but we're confident that we continue to meet our strategic objectives going forward. Example I always used to use or like to use, I think in 2008, our cohort has generated $1.9 billion over the period of time, which is fantastic when you think about that looking back at what that type of macro environment was. So we believe our model remains durable. Aman Bhutani : And Naved, on the Websites + Marketing, e-commerce customers, I think that's the data point you were referencing. We did share today the Websites + Marketing had grown 20%, but the Commerce SKU had been growing 24%. So we continue to see more customers in -- and that was ARR number. So we continue to see more attention in the Commerce SKU. And as I've shared earlier, we're actually launching a higher-end Commerce SKU, and it's testing in the U.S. now. So in terms of that -- in terms of the overall business, Commerce is becoming a bigger part of our Websites + Marketing business. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Sunil Rajgopal from Berenberg Capital Markets. Sunil Rajgopal : Can you hear me? Christie Masoner : We can. Sunil Rajgopal : All right. Can you shed some light on what is impacting the gross margins this quarter? And secondly, what does the management think about the recent announcement from Apple turning their handsets into payment terminals? Mark McCaffrey : I'll take the first part of that. And Aman, maybe you take the second part of that. The gross margin this quarter was impacted by aftermarket. It's a lower gross margin point than some of our other products. So the outperformance impacted our gross margin. We still feel very confident in our operating margin and our ability to grow normalized EBITDA given the leverage that those models actually provide for us. But that is -- and the aftermarket did provide some downward pressure on our gross margin. Aman Bhutani : And Sunil, on the Apple announcement, again, I'll touch on this tomorrow, but we have a firm belief that the commerce use cases are going to appear on every surface that exists. And be tightly coupled to every product that's out there that where it makes sense. So I actually touch on it tomorrow a bit to share at GoDaddy, we believe that Commerce use cases are just going to be Omnipresent on everything we do. So no surprise that Apple is sort of bringing forward capability that allows folks to sort of tap in there just with the icon. Christie Masoner : At this time, I'll turn the call back over to Aman. Aman, please to share some closing remarks. Aman Bhutani : Thank you, Christie, and thank you all for joining us. We look forward to spending more time with you tomorrow at our Investor Day. And I'll just end by thanking all the GoDaddy employees all over the world for another great quarter and all the hard work they put in coming in every day with everything else going on. Thank you very much.",

    "content": "\ufeff Christie Masoner : Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for GoDaddy's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. I'm Christie Masoner, Senior Director of Investor Relations. And with me today are Aman Bhutani, Chief Executive Officer; and Mark McCaffrey, Chief Financial Officer. Following prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions]. On today's call we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and operating metrics such as total bookings, unlevered free cash flow, normalized EBITDA, annualized recurring revenue or ARR gross merchandise volume or GMV and net debt. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents may be found in the presentation posted to our Investor Relations site at investors.godaddy.net or on our Form 8-K filed with the SEC with today's earnings release. The matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements, which include those related to our future financial results, our strategies or objectives with respect to future operations including our approach to capital allocation new product introductions and innovations and our ability to integrate acquisitions and achieve desired synergies. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC. Actual results may differ from those contained in forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today May 4, 2022 and except to the extent required by law we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. With that here's Aman. Aman Bhutani : Thank you, Christie and thank you all for joining us today. At GoDaddy, our mission is to empower entrepreneurs everywhere, making opportunity inclusive for all. With the secular trends of entrepreneurship coupled with accelerating online presence and commerce, we believe GoDaddy's role is to help our micro and small business customers take advantage of the largest opportunity in front of them, the combination of the Internet and commerce. We do this by helping customers establish and maintain their digital identity. Our tools help customers extend their web presence to social media and marketplaces and into their in-store experience, giving them ubiquitous presence. And we are bringing them to the world of connected commerce by enabling every surface for them with commerce. This mission has never been more important and GoDaddy's combination of assets makes us a unique and differentiated player in the market. Together digital identity, ubiquitous presence and Connected Commerce form the entrepreneurs wheel, representing our customers' needs and how we meet and exceed them. We shared this new framing for GoDaddy at our Investor Day in February. We also presented a three-year plan and we are off to a good start. In the first quarter of 2022, revenue grew 11% year-over-year and normalized EBITDA grew faster, up 18% year-over-year. While we all face a fluid macro environment, we are focused on what we can control and delivering on expectations for our customers and shareholders. We are keeping a close eye on the war in Ukraine. The financial impacts of the war on our business are limited but we remain critically concerned for the safety of our contractors in the area. A prolonged war will likely mean a bigger disruption in the work and delays in some product releases and rollouts as we ramp resources in other areas. We are also closely monitoring the uneven demand patterns as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and inflation and the strength of the US dollar is leading to FX headwinds across industries. Our business model is durable and offers us opportunities to adapt and be nimble. Our leadership team is focused on our three-year plan and mitigating short-term headwinds. Over the last several years, we have strengthened the quality of our revenue by delivering on our strategy to attract customers with higher lifetime value. Through disciplined execution, we have improved our renewal experience. And as a result, we have continued to drive modest improvements in our already high retention rates. An important data point that I am happy to share is that the 15-month renewal rate from the 2020 cohort of customers continues to be strong. Our commitment to our strategy is clearly highlighted in the consistency of our priorities. Our three strategic priorities have been and continue to be; first, driving Commerce through presence; second, delivering for GoDaddy Pros; and third, innovating in Domains. We covered our priorities in detail at Investor Day so I will provide brief comments on each of these today. On our first priority, we have delivered many product launches in the last couple of months. But the one I want to highlight is the launch of a new higher-tier Commerce Plus plan. The new offering includes increased customer value in the form of simplified taxes unlimited product listings and higher limits on many features. From marketplace orders to e-mail campaigns, the data is early and encouraging. 80% of sales in this new tier are from new purchases. I'm looking across our Commerce plans 70% of customers are now choosing GoDaddy Payments up from the 60% we shared in February. Annualized GMV across the GoDaddy ecosystem grew 20% year-over-year to $24 billion primarily driven by offline point of sale. For GoDaddy Pros, our focus continues to be to create best-in-class presence and commerce offerings and tooling for Managed WordPress. We continue to add more users to The Hub and our teams are working hard to increase rates of engagement. Our integration of Pagely continues at a good pace and we are excited about upcoming releases, which include a commerce offering and a new onboarding flow for Managed WordPress. I'm looking forward to sharing more about these new capabilities once they are launched. On innovation in Domains. In February, we shared that we are going to bring to market an innovative new product called Payable Domains. I am happy to share that we have started to test Payable Domains with a small percentage of customers in the US. It is too early to comment on how customers will receive and adopt this product, but we are eager to experiment with it as quickly as possible. In closing, I want to remind you that GoDaddy has built a durable business with a history of solid performance in all kinds of economic environment. By accelerating the rate of experimentation and innovation, we have continued to improve the quality of our products and enter new markets improving attach and ARPU and driving shareholder value. Our strength comes from our large customer base, extraordinary customer and revenue retention the power of our existing cohorts, the strong competitive advantages we have serving the micro and small business customer a clear three-year plan and a disciplined leadership team and workforce committed to our mission. With that here is Mark. Mark McCaffrey : Thanks, Aman and thank you everyone for joining us today. We are excited to share our strong Q1 results, which highlight our execution towards the targets we shared at our recent Investor Day. Our results demonstrate our focus on delivering a balanced combination of durable topline growth, profitability at scale, and robust cash flow and our performance shows GoDaddy's business resiliency. We are pleased that we were able to deliver a strong first quarter, while we actively manage through the uncertain global macro environment. In Q1, total revenue grew to $1 billion, which represents 12% growth year-over-year on a constant currency basis and 11% year-over-year on a reported basis. Within total revenue, international revenue grew 10% year-over-year on a constant currency basis. As shared earlier this year, we updated the lens by which we report the pillars of our revenue. This change transitioned our reporting from three revenue segments into two new segments; Applications and Commerce and Core Platform. This gives us the framework of how we will talk about our business and opportunities going forward. Applications and Commerce revenue, which includes presence in application solutions, grew 16% year-over-year. Coming in at the high end of our guidance range from February, our presence products such as Websites + Marketing contributed to this growth. And as Aman mentioned earlier, we drove great traction with the attach of our payment solution which will show up in this line item as it becomes more meaningful. The ARR for Applications and Commerce grew 14% year-over-year to $1.2 billion. ARR from our Create and Grow group of products which includes Websites + Marketing, Managed WordPress, Sellbrite, and GoDaddy Studio grew 13% year-over-year to $410 million. Lastly, annualized GMV across the GoDaddy ecosystem was approximately $24 billion, growing 20% year-over-year. We achieved growth across all channels, primarily driven by off-line point-of-sale. Core Platform revenue which includes Domains, Hosting, and Security products grew 9% year-over-year, delivering above our February guide with 40% of the increase driven by aftermarket. ARR for Core Platform grew 5% year-over-year to $2.2 billion. As a reminder, aftermarket performance does not impact ARR. Q1 bookings were $1.16 billion growing over 7% on a constant currency basis and 6% on a reported basis against tough comparisons from the strong year ago quarter. Additionally, Q1 bookings grew 10% sequentially against our largest ever Q4 quarter. Applications and Commerce bookings grew 9% year-over-year and Core Platform bookings grew 5% year-over-year. Normalized EBITDA grew 18% year-over-year to $226 million at a 23% margin, representing over a point of margin expansion compared to the same period last year and bringing our normalized EBITDA margins within the 23% to 24% guide we outlined at Investor Day. Our technology and development expenses increased as a percent of revenue this quarter as we focused on building our commerce and innovation strategies. Additionally, as we continued reopening offices in Q1 our G&A expenses also increased as a percentage of revenue while remaining below historical levels. We drove leverage in our marketing spend, based on continued execution of the formula outlined at Investor Day. Additionally, during Q1, we faced inflation pressures primarily in the form of increasing energy and cloud infrastructure expenses.  Currently, we have medium-term contracts and FX hedges to mitigate some of the foreseen impacts. We expect these inflation-related impacts to continue throughout 2022 and we will monitor and proactively address our exposure in these areas. Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter was $287 million, growing 7% year-over-year driven by strong profitability. Additionally, during the quarter we began executing against our announced $3 billion authorized share repurchase through an initial $750 million accelerated share repurchase or ASR expected to be completed in May. Through Q1, we repurchased an initial 6.5 million shares reducing our total share count by 4% since year-end bringing our free cash flow per share, to $5.25 on a trailing 12-month basis versus prior year cash flow per share of $4.51 for an increase of 16%. On the balance sheet, we finished Q1 with $743 million in cash and total liquidity of $1.3 billion. Net debt stands at $3.2 billion at the midpoint of our targeted range of two to four times. Moving on to our outlook. Given the solid start to our year and the predictability of our model, based on what we know now, we are comfortable with our full year 2022 outlook provided in February. Having said that we are not immune to the current macroeconomic environment, which increases our short-term exposure to foreign currency and customer demand fluctuations. While the environment remains fluid, we believe our predictable model allows us the flexibility to moderate our investments and leverage our operating expenses to seek to offset exposure to revenue from these factors. We also remain committed to delivering the $6-plus free cash flow per share discussed in February. For Q2, we are targeting total revenue in the range of $1.01 billion to $1.02 billion, which would represent year-over-year growth of 9% at the midpoint. Within that we expect Applications and Commerce revenue to grow between 14% and 16% and Core Platform revenue to grow between 5% and 7%. For Q2, and full year bookings we expect growth to be approximately two points below revenue, primarily driven by FX pressure. We will continue investing in technology and development to drive our robust product launch momentum while balancing our goal for margin expansion through efficiencies in customer care and marketing. Normalized EBITDA for Q2, is expected to be in the range of $232 million to $237 million, which would represent year-over-year growth of 18% at the midpoint. Our capital allocation strategy also remains unchanged. During the second and third quarter, we intend to fulfill our $1 billion buyback target for 2022 through an additional $250 million of share repurchases. Additionally, we will evaluate the impact of rising interest rates and explore refinancing our term loan and revolver, with the intention of maintaining our leverage ratio of 2 to 4 times. Before I close, I want to reiterate that we remain laser-focused on execution and we have a track record of consistency in difficult times. We are marching towards delivering the 10% top line CAGR, 15% normalized EBITDA CAGR and 20% or better free cash flow per share CAGR, while buying back $3 billion of our stock over the next three years, that we described in detail in our Investor Day. We are balancing our near-term and long-term goals, emphasizing, delivering strong results, while at the same time investing in areas for future growth. GoDaddy leads in providing small business solutions, a position that we built by understanding the needs of our more than 21 million customers. While the current macro events present challenges, GoDaddy's resiliency comes from our long history of strong customer retention, the power of our existing cohorts and the competitive advantages we built as the champion for small businesses. With that, we'll have Christie Masoner from our Investor Relations team open up the call for questions. A - Christie Masoner : Thanks, Mark. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Trevor Young from Barclays. Trevor, please go ahead. Trevor Young : Great. Thanks. Two if I may. Just first one any color on how customer growth has trended thus far in 2022 relative to the 3% growth last year? Aman, I think you made some comments about on a 15-month basis, the 2020 cohort is retaining at pretty healthy levels. I'm just trying to get a sense, kind of, like in-period demand from new customers. Have you seen any improvement in that cadence? And then, on international, revs declining a tad Q-on-Q. Were there any specific regions or countries where you saw weakness in the quarter? And did you see weakness specifically in Europe following the onset of the Russia-Ukraine conflict? Thanks. Aman Bhutani : Thanks, Trevor. This is Aman. On the 15-month retention rates one of the reasons I wanted to share that metric is, 2020 was a huge cohort for the company. And I think analysts have been asking us, investors have been asking us about retention rates on it. And we're very excited to see that we've continued to attract a customer with a high LTV, a customer that wants to stay with us. So those strong retention rates were obviously very, very important for us. And in terms of the customer growth, we don't guide to customer growth. But definitely at the end of the year, it will be something we'll be happy to talk about more and share with you. In terms of international, I'm sure Mark may mention a thing or two, but generally, I would say, we see the same sort of macro environment that you see in Europe as an example. In Russia we did shutdown our Russia website and removed support for the ruble. And that had an impact. And maybe, Mark, you want to comment on it. I wouldn't call it any sort of material impact. But perhaps, Mark, you want to comment on it? Mark McCaffrey : Yes. Thanks, Aman, and Trevor. I think that's exactly right, Aman. I think you stole the buy line. We did shut down. It didn't have a significant impact on us. I would say, it's more of the macroeconomic trends that are impacting us throughout Europe, and there isn't a particular exposure to any region or country at this point to call out. Trevor Young : Great. Thank you, both. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Clarke Jeffries from Piper Sandler. Clarke, please go ahead. Clarke Jeffries : Hello. Thank you for taking the question. Maybe addressing the previous question in a different way on a product level, just wanted some qualitative thoughts on the macro impacts to Domain demand, and if there was any characterization you could offer between North America demand and international demand for Domains? And then, I think as a follow-up to that. With a 40% increase driven by aftermarket, was that in line with your expectations or above? And as we settle into kind of cleaner compares, where do you think the growth contribution from aftermarket goes? Aman Bhutani : Yeah. Thanks, Clarke. I can take the first, and Mark perhaps you can take the second. In terms of domain demand, Clarke, I would point to the sort of core domain business for us, which is now much more than selling just specific TLDs. We sell a large sort of set of TLDs across the world. We've also added to that capability the secondary market. We then combine the primary market in the secondary market. We connected those really well. You will remember products like list for sale from a year, about a year and a half ago. And then, we've also added Corporate business in Domains and we've added more recently a Registry business as well. So we continue to be very happy with our overall Domains business. But it's really the collection of sort of diverse products that we have that are performing really well for us. And then, on the aftermarket, maybe Mark I can turn it to you. Mark McCaffrey : Yeah, absolutely. Thanks, Clarke. Hey listen, we couldn't be more happier than the momentum we have in the aftermarket. And I think we've talked about it coming out of Q4. And we continue to see strong volume growth and average prices going up. And that's what we really track when we look at the momentum around there. It's hard to predict the larger transactions but we still see them coming in. And we still see the momentum obviously quarter-over-quarter that created within that market. Nothing to call out domestic versus -- or sorry, North America versus international. It seems to be just broad-based momentum in that market and we continue to be pleased with the amount of transactions and the volume that is going through there right now. Clarke Jeffries : Good. And if I could squeeze one more in about just how the investment plan changes given the macro environment. Just trying to get a sense of whether you see it as a net benefit to profitability or whether there will be some offsetting costs you do have to rotate some of that kind of contractor headcount around. Is it kind of a net benefit or a net headwind to profitability as you look through the year? Aman Bhutani : Yeah. I think -- and if you're specifically talking about sort of my comments around the contractors in the Ukraine region. It is an important but a small group of people for us. So given our sort of large base of engineers across the world and our ability to hire globally and work with vendors around the world, we think overall it's not a huge shift. It is an important group of people. Their safety is of paramount importance to us but I wouldn't overfocus on it because the size of the group is small. Mark McCaffrey : Yeah. Clarke, I'll just add on to that. The cost is -- we don't look at it as a headwind. Clarke Jeffries : All right. Perfect. Thank you very much. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Ygal Arounian from Wedbush. Ygal, please go ahead. Ygal Arounian : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. I'll take the macro one again. Maybe like a kind of two-sided. So, one of the things we're seeing around is just a lot of pressure on e-commerce. I mean it sounded like from your comments in-store POS has been a big driver of strength in GMV images. Talk about the puts and takes on offline and online commerce that you're seeing. And then, when we have -- when we start to talk about recession, ultimately the impact to SMEs who are usually typically more exposed comes up a lot. So anything you're hearing from your SME customers? I know you're seeing things like improvements in renewals and things look pretty good but just the tone from your customers anything you're hearing there. Aman Bhutani : Thanks, Ygal. Look on bringing online and offline commerce together, what we call Connected Commerce is more important for our customers than ever before, right? They need to be able to quickly pivot to selling online or be able to bring those same capabilities in-store very, very quickly. Given our portfolio and given that we are still very early in the Connected Commerce space and the exposure we have to sort of GMV is generally small in our overall business, we're still growing in that area. We have lots of opportunity where I feel very, very early in that field. And in terms of different economic impacts. I would point you to a data point I think we shared a couple of years ago. When we looked at the data or the cohort for 2008, you might remember we talked about the recession, the Great Recession cohort. Well that cohort a couple of years ago had delivered $1.5 billion in revenue with GoDaddy. And today it is up to $1.9 billion in terms of what that cohort has delivered in terms of revenue. So we look at that cohort and we see it perform very similar to other cohorts. So we look at our business and we say look, we deliver a set of products at a price that delivered great value to our customers. This is essential to their future to their growth. And yes in the short term things might move up and down a bit but those cohorts over time continue to perform very, very well. And maybe I'll turn it to you to add a couple of more bits to that. Mark McCaffrey : Yes, and that's great. I think in these times what we're hearing is that being a one-stop shop for our customer base, which is entrepreneurs and very small businesses becomes an opportunity. They are focusing on their business and their ability to really count on us to help make their go-to-market easier seems to be something that is resonating with them. And a reminder, we generate about 85% of our revenue coming from our existing 21 million customers. So our ability to give them relevant products in the market is just a huge upside for us and we look at it as very much a positive going forward. Ygal Arounian : That's really helpful. And maybe if you could just talk about Commerce Plus a little bit and expand on that. It sounds \u2013 seems like a really interesting product. Is that you guys going a little bit more upmarket, or is that still a product that's more focused on your kind of micro SMB core customer? And anything you could share about price points and any other details around that will be super helpful. Thank you. Aman Bhutani : Sure, Ygal. In terms of the target customer like we shared on Investor Day, we have lots of customers in our base that sell up to $1 million or do up to $1 million of GMV a year. And as we had shared with you we want to be able to serve their needs because they are our customers already and we don't need to do that much more to serve them well. And we have talked about launching in Q1, a new higher-end SKU. That's what the Commerce Plus SKU is. Happy to send you details offline in terms of price points and how far it's launched and stuff like that. But you can literally go to the US website and see it. You will see 100% of the time. So it's absolutely there available to customers. And we're very excited about it like 80% of the sales that we have seen and have seen in that SKU have been new purchases, which means customers are willing to pay more for the greater value that we provided them. And it's definitely played a little bit of a part as well in the overall customers adopting GoDaddy Payments because now 70% of customers in our Commerce SKUs are adopting GoDaddy Payments, which was 60% in February that we shared with you. Ygal Arounian : Great. Thanks so much. Let me check that out on the site. Aman Bhutani : Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Zgutowicz from Benchmark. Mark, please go ahead. Mark, I believe you are muted. Mark Zgutowicz : Thanks for that. I just wanted to draft maybe on the couple of those last questions. On the new customer side of Commerce Plus which you highlighted, I'm just curious if you could maybe refresh us again on your go-to-market and sort of where perhaps those new customers are coming from. And then, as it relates to your GMV growth, obviously you noted mainly coming from POS. So just trying to get a sense of sustainability of that 20% growth and if that sort of corresponds to the CAGR that you're sort of talking about for Applications and Commerce three-year CAGR and sort of the high teens. If that would sort of parallel that growth. That's it for me. Thanks. Aman Bhutani : Thanks, Mark. On the new Commerce Plus plan in terms of go-to-market approach, it's super new product. We just launched it this last quarter. And most of the customer base is coming in through the web. So that's where we've done majority of the testing. No doubt, we have a huge competitive advantage in the Care organization and the ability of the Care organization to be able to have a fantastic relationship with our customers and to be able to upsell customers. But that is part of this year's priority for us to be able to get our go-to-market motion really swinging in terms of Commerce. But we're excited to have the product launch. We're excited to have customers like it we're excited that we can go to GoDaddy Payments. So that's been fantastic for us. In terms of GMV growth we just feel we're so early in the payment space and we have such a large customer base with this need. Of course, it's hard to sort of have a crystal ball and talk about specifics in terms of numbers of the long term. But we feel we're very, very early and there's just so much more for us to take. It's a massive TAM. We're positioned really well. We're putting out great innovative products in the market in terms of what we're doing with websites plus marketing. In my prepared comments, I mentioned a new commerce coming for WordPress. We have payable domains out there now testing in the US. So, we're really lighting up all our services with Commerce. So we feel we're just earlier. Mark Zgutowicz : Super. Well, thanks very much. I appreciate it. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Kessler from Raymond James. Aaron, please go ahead. Aaron Kessler : Great. Can you hear me? Maybe just -- I know you've been working on the cloud transition for a couple of years. Now can you just talk about where you are on that? And then any impact that you're seeing from overall labor costs obviously a question coming up on a lot of our conference calls as well? And then finally, just in terms of the lower year-over-year marketing spend. Nice leverage there. I guess, how much of an impact is that having on kind of gross adds or customer adds for that lower marketing spend, or have you been able to find more efficient sources? I think you mentioned that at the Investor Day as well? Thank you. Aman Bhutani : Yes. Thanks, Aaron. Let me take the cloud and marketing and Mark maybe you can comment on the labor costs. In terms of our transition to cloud, we continue to be very happy with our applications moving to the cloud. We're seeing higher productivity, we're seeing better responsiveness. We measure our applications with the Google tools and they performed very, very well, both sort of in the US and globally. So we're very excited about that. The transition is going to plan nothing significant to call out there. In terms of our marketing dollars, I think over the last year, we've been very open about sharing with you our philosophy around marketing, while making sure that we lean into the demand when we see it. And then as we see sort of changes in the mat pattern that we manage our marketing dollars. We don't want to manage them too aggressively because we don't want to pull demand down just for GoDaddy but we do want to follow the demand patterns. And what we are doing is that we're coupling that with investments in data science and better data and better technology that's allowing us to make a \u2013 measure that marketing spend better and better every year and be more efficient with it. And Mark I'll turn it to you for the labor cost comment. Mark McCaffrey : Yeah. And thanks Aaron. On labor costs we have been in a hypercompetitive environment for talent here for a number of years. So we've been constantly looking at how do we attract talent but yet have levers in place to moderate the cost buildup appropriately. And that hasn't changed, and we're not seeing anything that would cause us to think that that's going to be what we haven't built into our guide already. And we continue to look for opportunities to diversify the locations of our employees going forward to make sure we can maintain that into our three-year outlook. Aaron Kessler : Great. Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from Elizabeth Porter from Morgan Stanley. Elizabeth. Please go ahead. Elizabeth, please un-mute. Elizabeth Porter : Hi. Thank you so much. I have a question on the competitive landscape. So back in March Google announced that they were going GA with their Domains product after being in beta for multiple years. So I just wanted to get your view on the \u2013 any changes to the competitive landscape? Thanks. Aman Bhutani : Thank you, Elizabeth. Specific to Google, we've been competing with Google on Domains for I think seven years or more. And the removal of sort of the beta logo if you will it doesn't change \u2013 sort of create any fundamental change in the industry from my view. Competing with the mega tech players is a fact of life for every tech business. So I feel we've been competing with them and sort of not much has changed with this little change from them. Elizabeth Porter : Great. And then on the payment side, great to see that adoption kind of ticked up to 70% from 60%. And I believe that's just new customers that are going into Commerce. So I wanted to see, if there had been any change in legacy customers kind of moving over to GoDaddy Payments from their prior provider just given the competitive kind of pricing that you guys offer with that product. Aman Bhutani : Yeah. I think majority of what we've talked about is new customers going through the site. In terms of our legacy customers, we continue to feel that is a big opportunity for GoDaddy. Anecdotally, we do see a set of customers that are attractive. So we know that our pricing makes sense. We know that, this is something we can scale. But that's part of this year's priority for us to get the go-to-market motions at scale across the company, so that we can go after not just the new but the legacy customers as well. But it's just \u2013 that is still work in progress. Elizabeth Porter : Thank you. Aman Bhutani : Yep. Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Brent, please go ahead. Brent Thill : Thanks, good afternoon. I guess a couple, on financially the bookings growth trailed revenue this quarter. I guess, was that more just a comp, or was there anything on the internal execution that you call out that caused that? Mark McCaffrey : I'll jump into that one Aman. You can add color. You hit it right on the head there. It's \u2013 we're comping to a tough quarter last year. We did talk about January at Investor Day and some of the impacts in the market and we've seen positive momentum coming out of the quarter which gives us a lot of comfort as we get into the rest of the year. We're excited about it. So there's nothing in particular to call out that we haven't already mentioned. And we also are very happy that coming off a great Q4. The bookings growth was pretty strong. So we like the momentum, we like the opportunities out there in the market right now. Obviously, it's an interesting time, but we continue to manage through it and we feel good about where we think we're going to end up for the year and the quarter Q2. Brent Thill : And maybe just a quick follow-up that obviously the elephant in the room was watching is the interest rates and what that does to the small business segment. And I'm curious how you're thinking about this and what happens not maybe this quarter, next quarter but over the next year? How do you think you can kind of be more insulated or not? Curious how you think through this as that rolls through? Mark McCaffrey : Yes. Brent, I'll take it on two ends on that one. One, us internally and then two customer demand. And Aman may have some comments on the customer end of it. One on our end we're -- I think it's in our prepared remarks or slide we're about 13% variable interest rate right now. So we think the impact for us in the quarter and the year will be minimal. Obviously, we will as we mentioned we look to refinance our term loan and our revolver. And if it makes sense we'll do so. But we think those are the things within our control. When it comes to our customer base it's hard to predict the overall impact of inflation, but we believe because our products help them do business and our ability to be a one-stop shop helps them ultimately be more efficient in the marketplace and focus on growing their business that we are an additive tool for them versus something they will have to choose between. But it's hard to look at the overall impact on the three years. And Aman I don't know if you want to add to that at all. Aman Bhutani : Maybe just to say Brent appreciate the long-term view on the question. My view is that we have the secular trends around entrepreneurship around the Internet around commerce on the Internet. We're positioned really well. This is a critical need for micro and small businesses. So the TAM is large. GoDaddy's positioning is very, very good. It's mission-critical to customers. They don't -- in a difficult time customers don't give up their website or they don't give up their domain anymore. Lots of them don't do that. So from my perspective if times are tough for our customers that's actually opportunity for GoDaddy to do more for them. That's the opportunity to GoDaddy has to help them understand how they can navigate those times better. And as I shared about sort of the 2008 cohort we can end up with fantastic customers in all kinds of economic environments. Brent Thill : Thank you. Aman Bhutani : Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Sunil Rajgopal from Berenberg. Sunil, please go ahead. Sunil Rajgopal : Hi. Can you please comment about the overhead expenses line seems to have gone up quite a bit this quarter? And also my second question will be on the Payments front. Just want to understand a little bit more I know you commented earlier about that you are still in the early phase of deployment in terms of the payment opportunity. But have you thought about what would be the potential opportunity from our payable Domains and how that could potentially accelerate your revenue stream going forward? Thank you. Mark McCaffrey : I'll hit the first part of that and Aman maybe you can handle the second. And Sunil, I assume you're talking about the G&A line when you say overhead. Sunil Rajgopal : Right. Mark McCaffrey : It represents -- we started reopening our offices in Q1, so saw a small uptick as we got ready for that. It's still below historical levels and we expect it to be in one going forward and we're comfortable with where we are in our normalized EBITDA margins that we put out there in the guide and also for our three-year plan. But the specific increase was related to opening the offices in Q1. Aman Bhutani : And Sunil, on payable domains, I think, my excitement about that product sort of leaked out during Investor Day. I'm sure you will notice how excited I get about it. My view is it's a fundamentally new idea. Nobody else is selling that product. We have tremendous scale to bring that to market. But we have to work with customers to understand -- to help them understand what the new product is. And that's what we're going through. That's what we're testing. We have great estimates on what we think it can be. That's definitely why we're talking about it and we're excited about it. And we'll keep you informed on how it progresses. You'll be able to see it on the side. You'll be able to see us doing more and more with it. Sunil Rajgopal : Sure. Thank you. And maybe if I could just follow-up. You talked about inflationary pressures in terms of the cloud infrastructure costs going up. So how should we be thinking about those costs? And is there, I mean, do you think it will incrementally pose pressure on margin, I mean, pushing the margins towards the low end of the guidance? Mark McCaffrey : So when we look at the infrastructure cloud costs, we're still in the process of moving to the cloud. I think we've talked about that and our impact on our tech and dev line. And we still look at it as an opportunity to moderate our cost as well as reduce our capital expenditures going forward. Everything that we are looking at today we've included in the guide not only for the year, but for our three-year plan. And we feel comfortable with our normalized EBITDA margins where they are. Obviously, lots of puts and takes. But we're comfortable where we are and built in what we can see today. Sunil Rajgopal : Thank you very much. Christie Masoner : As a reminder, if you\u2019d like to ask the question, please use the raise hand feature at the bottom of the webinar screen. Our next question comes from the line of Naved Khan from Truist. Naved, please go ahead. Naved, I think you are on mute. I will turn the call back over to Aman for closing remarks. Aman Bhutani : Thank you Christie, and thank you all for joining us today. I'll end the call by just thanking all the GoDaddy team members who have been doing a tremendous job getting out these results and all the good work we do for our customers as well. And may the fourth be with you.",

And with me today are Aman Bhutani, Chief Executive Officer; and Mark McCaffrey, Chief Financial Officer. Following prepared remarks we will open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] On today's webinar we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and operating metrics such as total bookings, unlevered free cash flow, normalized EBITDA, annualized recurring revenue or ARR, gross merchandise volume or GMV and net debt. Growth rates presented represent year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise noted.

The matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements, which include those related to our future financial results our strategies or objectives with respect to future operations, including our approach to capital allocation, new product introductions and innovations and our ability to integrate acquisitions and achieve desired synergies. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today August 3, 2022 and except to the extent required by law we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. With that here's Aman. Aman Bhutani : Thank you Christie, and thank you all for joining us today. At GoDaddy, our mission is to make opportunity more inclusive for all. The best moments of my week are when I'm engaging with GoDaddy customers. I am constantly inspired by their grit and determination and amazed by their resilience. Just a couple of weeks ago, I spoke at a small business summit. I've met so many GoDaddy customers there and some who will hopefully become GoDaddy customers in the future. While they're worried about the current economic environment, I found them driven, ambitious, upbeat and passionate about their businesses. One customer walked up to me and started with my life is on GoDaddy. I am inspired to do more for her and all our customers to be better every day. Our relentless focus on innovation, deliver seamless and intuitive technology complemented by human care helping customers grow their businesses and achieve their dreams. Our strategy to attract high-value customers continue to show success best illustrated by our customer retention rates, which have remained greater than 85%. The Q2 results demonstrate our steady operating discipline, 9% growth in revenue and 30% growth in normalized EBITDA despite the challenging FX environment. GoDaddy's strong and diverse business enables us to navigate fluid global demand patterns and inflation concerns from a solid position and we are committed to attention and action on what we control. As in the past, we aligned our marketing spend and other investments with demand signals, concentrating on success-based, disciplined and efficient spending. We actively identify and deploy marketing spend where we find opportunities to deliver long-term growth. Through this plan we create balance across all components of our business without sacrificing our investment in technology and development for future growth. Our strategic priorities have been consistent over the past six quarters. First, driving Commerce through presence; second, delivering for GoDaddy Pros; and third, innovating in Domains. Beginning with Commerce, we are pleased to share that we continue to achieve positive trajectory with our GoDaddy Payments offering and more specifically the attach rates to our other products. For Websites + Marketing, more than 80% of our Commerce customers choose our payment solution and for Managed WordPress, 30% of our Commerce customers choose our payment solution. Annualized GMV also continues to rise with Q2 at $28 billion, growing 12% year-over-year. We continue to drive strong sales in payment hardware devices enabling robust in-store capabilities for customers, while also steadily approving payment applications. While our payments offering is still relatively new, GoDaddy's differentiated OmniCommerce solution is well-positioned in this space. Regardless of the consumers' preferences whether they are shopping online or in person, our solutions empowers our customers to benefit from our industry-low transaction rates in all locations. We also rolled out Apple Pay on GoDaddy Payments improving the buying experience and Apple selected GoDaddy as a Tap to Pay partner. We are excited to work with Apple to bring Tap to Pay on iPhone to GoDaddy customers later this year. And as always we will share more information about this partnership as it becomes more meaningful. We embedded more capabilities within Websites plus Marketing plans to make it easier for entrepreneurs to market their products, sell online, manage their business and grow. New capabilities include product image enhancement, including background removal, quick view and buy capabilities enabling single-click add to cart, integrated discounting shipping labels, online appointment features making calendaring and appointments more intuitive. Enhancing our products helps our customers grow their business while building retention and creating greater lifetime value for GoDaddy. We also continue to test price increases for our highly competitive and feature-rich Websites plus Marketing product. Our approach to pricing is nuanced taking into consideration the right balance of increased price and market share while also closely monitoring shifts in customer behavior due to macro factors. We have limited the use of heavy discounting programs that frequent this space while maintaining our competitive position by offering products that our customers value. Our customer retention rates remain strong with consistent 15-month cohort retention, which is trending higher than prior year cohorts. And our overall customer retention metric has stayed above 85% even as we observe some pressure for customers due to macro factors. This is something we are extremely proud of because it is a sign that we continue to deliver for an often left behind customer the micro businesses that are the backbone of their local communities. We are proud that Websites plus Marketing delivers websites for customers that are highly performant. We have pushed the bar further on that and have implemented significant behind-the-scenes changes that result in improved website performance for millions of sites. These powerful improvements enable GoDaddy customers to achieve improved paid speed insights and Core Web Vitals scores. For example, our Core Web Vitals pass rate for our customers' sites increased by 75% making us the leader in this category. These improvements ensure GoDaddy's customers' websites rank higher in search results. And for small businesses this is extremely important. Moving on to GoDaddy Pros. This quarter we launched a beta WooSaaS solution to allow us to reach a larger customers those with sales of $1 million to a few million dollars. These larger customers will be able to sell anywhere including in-person on their online store and in online marketplaces and social platforms and benefit from omnichannel payment processing all managed in one place. This new online store offering provides growing merchants virtually infinite flexibility of WordPress plus WooCommerce combined with highly performing scalable and secure cloud hosting technology and a seamless intuitive and comprehensive software user experience. The fully managed technology stack allows our customers to focus on running their business. We brought together a team of experts in multiple technology domains to create this new premium offering which includes exclusive functionality with free premium extensions and exclusive capabilities such as an expert level dedicated support team. Our customers want a one-stop shop offering from us and WooSaaS solution is the latest proof point of GoDaddy's ability to move slightly up market over time. The beta program started in Q2 with an invite-only group of WooCommerce merchants and partners testing the integration and unification of multiple acquired technologies to offer a seamlessly managed all-in-one experience for WooCommerce stores. We are excited about the possibilities and looking forward to a full marketing launch. On our third priority, we are excited about the upcoming full launch of Payable Domains in Q3 a limited pilot program in Q2 focused on learnings demonstrated that customers value the offering. We also saw some green shoots in terms of meaningful GPV in the pilot being driven by customers without a website. In our Q3 launch, Payable Domains will be included for free and by default with every domain purchase creating a frictionless out-of-the-box experience for new businesses. We believe this will simplify the online payments process for our customers by giving them a professional branded checkout experience and the freedom to accept online payments without needing any other subscription. In closing, I want to acknowledge that while we are all in uncertain times GoDaddy's relentless focus on executing against our strategic priorities, delivering for our customers, building seamless and intuitive technology for our customers to succeed backed by human care, our scale and vast portfolio of offerings steadily drives GoDaddy's consistent financial results. Our incredible customers inspire us to continue to innovate and do even more for them. We will continue to be prudent stewards of capital investing behind long-term growth drivers and staying committed to delivering value to our customers, employees and shareholders. With that here's Mark. Mark McCaffrey : Thanks, Aman and thank you, everyone for joining us today. GoDaddy's resiliency and durable top line growth, profitability at scale and robust cash flow are evident in our Q2 financial results and enable GoDaddy to continue to invest to deliver long-term value while returning excess capital to investors in the form of share buybacks. Revenue in Q2 was $1 billion, growing 9% on a reported basis and 10% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the currency impact, our reported revenue would have come in at the high end of our Q2 guidance. Within total revenue international revenue grew 4% on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis. Applications and Commerce revenue grew 15% within the target range of 14% to 16%, driven by continued strength in our Create and Grow products and Email attach. The ARR for Applications and Commerce grew 12% to more than $1.2 billion. And within that the ARR from our Create and Grow products grew 10% to $420 million. Additionally annualized GMV across the GoDaddy ecosystem was approximately $28 billion, growing 12%. Core platform revenue grew 7% delivering at the high end of our 5% to 7% Q2 guidance, primarily due to strength in domain registration, aftermarket and security, offset by a slight decrease in our hosting business. ARR for our core platform grew 5% to $2.3 billion. Q2 bookings totaled $1.12 billion, growing 6% on a reported basis and 8% on a constant currency basis. Applications and Commerce bookings grew 10% and core platform bookings grew 4% on similar growth factors noted for revenue. Normalized EBITDA grew 30% to $258 million. Our 25% margin represented over four points of margin expansion primarily because of expanded gross margins on product mix and reduced marketing spend. The decreased marketing spend is the result of disciplined moderation of our investment as we zero in on success-based marketing and flex our spending to capture attractive returns. Our technology and development expenses increased as a percent of revenue this quarter as we advanced our commerce and innovation strategies. Lastly, we recognized a $10 million impairment charge related to IT licenses and facilities as we continue to simplify our infrastructure. Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter totaled $274 million. growing 16% driven by strong profitability. Additionally, year-to-date, we completed $1 billion of share buybacks, repurchasing 12.8 million shares and reducing our fully diluted share count by approximately 8% since year-end. Free cash flow per share rose to $5.67 on a trailing 12-month basis versus the prior year cash flow per share of $4.78, a 19% increase on strong cash flow and share repurchases. On the balance sheet, we finished Q2 with $770 million in cash and total liquidity of $1.4 billion. Net debt stands at $3.1 billion, at the midpoint of our targeted range of two to four times. Moving on to our outlook. We continue to be confident in our ability to execute in the second half of 2022, and are on target to meet our full year operational and strategic goals, including our targets around normalized EBITDA, unlevered free cash flow, and cash flow per share. With that said, we are not immune to the macro environment of the strengthening dollar and the impact that it has on our top line performance. Assuming a continuation of today's rates, over the rest of the year, we expect that the adverse FX impact for the full year to be approximately $35 million or approximately 1%, compared to our full year revenue guidance issued in February. As a result, we revised our 2022 full year revenue outlook to $4.1 billion to $4.13 billion. We remain focused on driving strong financial results, and are committed to delivering $1.1 billion, in unlevered free cash flow and $6 plus free cash flow per share, as laid out earlier this year. We are also increasing our margin expectations, for normalized EBITDA to 24% to 25% for the full year, based on strong execution and disciplined investments. For Q3, we are targeting total revenue in the range of $1.03 billion to $1.045 billion, representing growth of 8% at the midpoint. The adverse FX impact to the range assuming continuation of today's rates, would be approximately $10 million or 1% flowing through this impact, we expect Applications and Commerce revenue to grow between 13% and 15%, and core platform revenue to grow between 4% and 6%. For Q3, and full year bookings, we expect growth to be approximately two points below revenue primarily driven by FX pressure. We will continue investing in technology and development, to drive our robust product launch momentum, while balancing our goal for margin expansion through efficiencies in customer care and marketing. Normalized EBITDA for Q3, is expected to be in the range of $250 million to $260 million, which would represent growth of 12% at the midpoint. Our capital allocation strategy remains the same. We fulfilled our $1 billion buyback target for 2022, and we'll continue to evaluate use of cash options for the remainder of the year, in line with our disciplined capital allocation framework. Lastly, as we said last quarter, we will evaluate the impact of rising interest rates and explore refinancing our term loan and revolver with the intention of maintaining our leverage ratio of two to four times. Before I close, I want to remind folks that during economic times like now, our strong balance sheet consistent cash flow and strength of execution, enable us to improve upon our market-leading position, through prudent investments and market share gains growing the business long term while also delivering on our profit and cash flow goals. Our 21 million customers create the foundation for our resiliency. We enjoy exceptional retention, and we continue to execute on our strategic priorities, build deeper relationships and partner alongside entrepreneurs on their journey. We are laser focused on operational execution and we are dedicated to delivering 10% plus top line CAGR, 15% plus normalized EBITDA CAGR and 20% or better free cash flow per share CAGR through 2024. And with $1 billion of buybacks complete, halfway through the year, we remain committed to executing against the remaining $2 billion of shares, under our current authorization through 2024. With that, we will have Christie Masoner, from our Investor Relations team to open up the call for questions. A - Christie Masoner : Thanks, Mark. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Trevor Young from Barclays. Trevor, please go ahead. Trevor Young : Great. Thanks. Two if I may. First, what drove the sequential uptick in gross margin? How much of an impact was FX on GM given that maybe a bit more of COGS there, such as like domain pass-through costs and infrastructure are incurred in dollars versus the revenue mix? And then second, on the price testing, Aman, I think you alluded to it. It looks like what we saw in our end both basic premium and Commerce plan saw increases mid-July ranging from like $1 to $3 a month, which translates to some pretty healthy increases on a percentage basis. Could you just clarify are these increases just for new customers versus existing subs? Is it domestic versus worldwide? And what do you expect the weighted average increase to be once this is fully rolled out? Aman Bhutani : Mark, do you want to take the gross margin? Mark McCaffrey : Yes, no problem. Hey, Trevor, how are you doing? So I would say, most of the gross margin mix was -- or change was based on product mix. The FX impact to that was pretty nominal. Aman Bhutani : And then on pricing, yes, what you saw Trevor was us testing some changes and those were the price test for Websites + Marketing. In terms of taking that international, as I've shared before, the price testing for us is quite nuanced. We base it on geography, on sort of customer expectations, changing on market share. So you'll see it appear in certain geographies, but not in others. Trevor Young : That's really helpful. And just, Mark, just to clarify on the gross margin. If FX rates stay where they're at today, should we expect some impact on gross margin in the balance of the year from currency? Mark McCaffrey : Yes. So most of the impact on the FX affects our bookings, our costs are pretty much fixed and in line with the US dollar. So I would say, look for most of the FX impact to flow through to bookings and then ultimately lead to revenue with minimal impact on the cost in our structure today. Trevor Young : Great. Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau from William Blair. Matt, please go ahead and talk. Matt Pfau : Great. Thanks, guts. Aman, you called out retention rates continue to remain strong. You did see some pressure from macro factors. Are there certain areas where you're seeing the macro impact your business more than others, maybe both on the product side as well as on geography? Aman Bhutani : Yes. Thanks, Matt. Perhaps one thing to call out geographically is that, we see some greater pressure for European customers right now, given inflation or other macro factors. So that's something we're keeping an eye on. But, overall, we have continued to sort of focus our efforts to bring in customers that have high LTV, have great intent to build businesses to stay with us. So that's allowing us to stay with the high retention rates the 85% plus. So we're pretty happy with that overall. Matt Pfau : Got it. And then, just a question on the marketing spend. You adjusted debt for demand, should we expect if macro improves and demand ramps back up that then we could see that go back up as a percentage of revenue, or how do you think about that adjusting that dial going forward? Aman Bhutani : Yes. My broad view on marketing spend is that, we let it trail the demand and the signals we see and we look at both sort of external signals in terms of the Google universe and such, giving us data, but also our customers' data and what we're seeing in terms of return on marketing investment. So what you can expect is, if the demand spikes again, our marketing spend will follow, but we're also constantly improving the success-based metric for our marketing. So you'll see potentially some optimizations that continue to come. And we -- as an example, in Investor Day we shared some improvements in our SEM spend which was all based on improvement rather than just demand. So you'll see a mix of both. Mark McCaffrey : And I'll add, we continue to expect to get leverage out of our marketing line, especially, as our business and our solutions are broader, as we get into more commerce as we get into more aftermarket. As once customers are into entrepreneur wheel, our efficiency and marketing gets better. So over time we expect to get leverage out of that marketing line and continue to be able to expand our normalized EBITDA margins based on that. Matt Pfau : Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Brent, please go ahead. Brent Thill : Thanks. Many of the companies in the peer group around SMB have been calling out higher churn impact from macro. I'm just curious if you can kind of drill in and ultimately give us a sense of what is leaving you more immune to this and what's resonating some of the new product set? And then I had a quick follow-up. Aman Bhutani : Yeah. Sure Brian. So let's start with the customer, right? GoDaddy's average customer is the micro business. A-third of our micro business customers are solopreneurs. We add to that the fact that the products we sell create tremendous value for our customers and the price we charge leaves plenty of consumer surplus for our customers right? So even if they have to adapt to changing economic environment the products we typically sell to them tend to be the last products they walk away from. So that's why we see sort of the continued high retention rates for customers. But also keep in mind, the more we have focused in terms of attracting the customer, to whom we can attach more and more products and reach higher LTV that sort of limits some of the \u2013 should I say, discounting and other techniques that companies might use to attract a lot of customers that may not have sort of good retention rates. But obviously, our strategy is to attract the customers that have high LTV have good retention rates. Mark McCaffrey : And I'll just throw in there. The care relationship becomes extremely important in these times. And having that relationship and the person to go to, to help fix come up with more economic solutions to provide value seems to be and continue to be a winning formula and in these times even more important to that customer base. Brent Thill : Okay. And real quick, I think the Street unlevered free cash flow number is a little bit. Your number was a little bit below what the Street wanted. Was there anything to read into the number this quarter? I know, you're reiterating the long term but anything to comment there relative to the Street? Mark McCaffrey : Nothing. We're really happy with our progress and we continue to work towards our annual goal. Brent Thill : Excellent. Thanks,. Aman Bhutani : Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Porter from Morgan Stanley. Elizabeth, please go ahead, Elizabeth Porter : Great. Thank you so much. Just as the entrepreneurs while let's get a little bit stretched with inflation and higher interest rates are you guys seeing any change in behavior or willingness to pay up for more expensive tiers or functionality across the portfolio? Aman Bhutani : Thanks, Elizabeth. So, as you know, the higher premium tier offerings are especially in the case of Website + Marketing with the new Commerce Plus offering is relatively new for us right? And we're just super excited and announcing the launch of our WooSaaS solution, which is also going to be a premium offering. But all of these businesses are very new for us right? We have a base of 21 million customers. We have great relationships in Care. So we're sort of early in the process and not of course we realize that customers feel the pinch of inflation but these businesses are small for us in our core products they just deliver tremendous amounts of value. And one of the things we sometimes say here is people don't give up their dream because of an economic downturn. So they're not going to give up the domain name. Elizabeth Porter : Got it. And then as a follow-up I was hoping if you could provide more color on what you're seeing in terms of those macro impacts on demand. I know Verisign reported a weaker outlook on domains, which raised some questions. And it sounds like churn is holding in pretty well. So just any incremental you could provide particularly on kind of the new customer demand would be really helpful. Aman Bhutani : Yeah. We're definitely in a fluid demand environment and it's different by geography. I didn't make a small comment earlier about the European demand being weaker. But just to take a step back and look at the customer or the domains business overall if we look at GoDaddy's business it's very broad. Obviously, we sell 400 TLDs. We have a primary market. We have a secondary market the aftermarket business. In both cases, we are leaders in those businesses. We've invested in a corporate domains business. You saw us take on a registry business over the last couple of years and that's grown very well for us too. So when we look at our Domains business we feel it's a much broader business with many levers that obviously we use to continue to grow it compared to any one registry out there that may have one or a few TLDs. So that we think our business is quite different. Elizabeth Porter : Great. Thank you so much. Aman Bhutani : Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Kessler from Raymond James. Aaron, please our ahead. Aaron Kessler : All right. Maybe just if you can talk a little bit about the ad environment just kind of hearing with ad pricing kind of coming down. Are you seeing kind of less competition and maybe getting some more efficiencies from a pricing coming down, whether it's Google Search or other areas? And then maybe just talk a little bit about the M&A environment just in terms of how you're seeing valuations get more attractive with obviously public equities coming down as well? Thank you. Aman Bhutani : Yes. On the sort of ad environment, it's always a competitive marketplace. I would never quite ever call that easy. But as we shared with you at Investor Day we continued to sort of push more success-based improve our abilities with bidding with machine learning to get better and better efficiencies. So, you do see some of that in our marketing leverage improvements. But overall I would just say the competitive dynamics are still the competitive dynamics. Obviously, in certain quarters, it's a bit easier than others, but overall, I wouldn't say there's some huge shift in it yet. And Mark on M&A. Mark McCaffrey : On M&A our approach hasn't changed. We have our capital allocation strategy that we've talked about. We have our M&A strategy that we've talked about has to fit strategically has to work financially and has to be able to be integrated. We'll evaluate anything that comes along those lines. Obviously, we don't talk about anything active in any way shape or form. But we try to balance our decisions for today based on keeping an eye on our long-term objectives and we remain laser-focused on executing our objectives right now and we feel good about having a strong and solid year. Aaron Kessler : Great. Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Zgutowicz from Benchmark. Mark, please go ahead. Mark Zgutowicz : Thanks Christie. Just a couple of questions quick ones on Payments and then on macro. On Payments you mentioned that 30% stat of WordPress customers using your Payments. I'm curious how you sort of move that number up and sort of what you see as sort of a trajectory over the next couple of years? And then in terms of the Apple Pay being added was that simply a cart conversion decision, or is there some potential pull in of new subscribers that potentially comes with that. And then on the macro, maybe just two sides of the coin. One those are centered around marketing, but how much of your marketing budget reduction is aligned to just lower absolute demand? And then on the flip side of that in terms of the success that you're seeing upselling products, what is the characteristic of that subscriber that is buying new product? Is it simply duration of a subscriber? Is there -- are there regional tier characteristics? Anything on that side of the coin would be interesting as well. Thanks. Aman Bhutani : Sure. Thanks Mark. Let me take the Payments and Apple Pay piece and maybe and I can tag team on the other two items. So, on Payments GoDaddy Payments for Managed WordPress, we're super excited to move that number for 25% to 30%. You asked what are the types of things that we do. Customers actually have a choice of -- I think it's 140 options that they can choose from in WordPress. So, we're continually improving the experience for customers. So, it's easier and easier for them to make that choice for them to be able to differentiate between those choices and pick the best choice. And in that -- with those simplification and improvements, we see in this improvement to 30%. In terms of without commenting on sort of specific numbers that we'd be at in a couple of years, what I would say is we're very, very focused on simplifying the customer experience. We're very, very focused on delivering the one-stop shop to our customers whether they're selling in-store on their online store or on social media or the major marketplaces. So, giving that one subscription to our customers and letting them do everything they want to do from one place clearly is our objective. In terms of Apple Pay, so there are a couple of things there. There is the Apple Pay support and the Tap to Pay partnership. I think you're referencing the Tap to Pay partnership. And it's just super early. This just got announced by Apple, we'll happily share more with you as that sort of partnership develops. Mark McCaffrey : And I'll start on the macro and the marketing budget. No doubt demand has been fluid in 2022, but overall it's been pretty solid. We look at marketing more as efficiency and optimization. We do look at things like Aman mentioned demand is down in Europe and we just accordingly. But where we continue to look at the ROI and optimize it based on not only our expanded product offerings, but how successful we are on the entrepreneurs wheel and our ability to attach. So, it's -- like I said, demand is definitely fluid, but the marketing is being efficient and optimized to make sure we're capturing the demand that makes sense. And then, I think there was a -- and I apologize there's a few questions in there. I think we had... Mark Zgutowicz : Yeah. Sorry the other question was the other side of that coin in terms of the up-sell the success you're having up-selling products. Just curious, I guess the subscriber characteristics that are absorbing those products? Is it regional? Is it just the duration longer they're with you the more likely they're going to buy? Aman Bhutani : Yeah. Sure. So the core funnel for us continues to be folks coming in to buy domains and attaching Email, attaching Websites, attaching Websites turning into attaching Commerce and we're laser focused on optimizing conversion through those funnels. We're also very, very focused on tracking the customer that has that intention, right? So if our marketing is intent focused and the conversion funnel is good, that's what allows us to attach more-and-more products. And of course we shared at Investor Day, a lot of good data in terms of penetration for emails for example with our 21 million customer base. We're also creating new products and bringing them to the market. The best example of that is Payable Domains, where you don't have to attach payments to a domain. You buy a domain, you get checkout page that you can customize that's enabled for your domain automatically. So you literally buy the domain and you can start taking payments, right? And that's a bit of a different movement, in that we're not selling the product and then attaching more, we're bundling it in right with the first purchase and literally putting -- and the idea there is put Commerce on every surface we have because that is in a sense the OmniCommerce ethos right, like wherever you're transacting, whatever surface you're creating your Commerce or your Micro Business is enabled in there. Mark Zgutowicz : Thank you. Super helpful. Aman Bhutani : Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from Evercore ISI. Mark, please go ahead. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thanks, Christie. Two questions, one, international revenue growth I think is pretty consistently trailed out of your global growth. Is there anything there that you need to solve for to change that? And then secondly, Mark on share repurchases and you've repurchased what you said, you were going to do on trail or on track or even a little bit faster. So just thinking about it going forward you're generating a lot of free cash flow. What would cause you to even up that range? Like, what would you have to see that would make buying back the stock even more attractive than it's already been? I don't want to -- I'm not asking what more can you do for us, but I guess I am asking that a little bit. You obviously purchased back a lot of stock. You had the ability to purchase more. What would cause you to amp that up faster? Thanks. Mark McCaffrey : Aman, why don't you take the first part of that? And I'll take the second. Aman Bhutani : Thanks Mark. Yes, we're very happy with the international business. Over nine million of our 21 million customers are outside the U.S. and represent tremendous opportunity as we bring more and more products to that customer base outside the U.S. so, super bullish super happy with it. Some macro headwinds there, of course FX is there and we see some demand challenges too. But structurally, no concern with the international business, continue to be very happy with it, continue to allocate marketing dollars where we see the best return. And over the last two, three years I will say you've seen us move those dollars back and forth a bit. And that has some impact but no -- like super happy with it overall. And Mark for you. Mark McCaffrey : And Mark thanks for pointing out we have a lot of free cash flow. Obviously that's a good thing in the especially in this day and age. We're really happy we've been able to execute on the $1 billion six months in. And we are continuing to balance our decisions today based on what our objectives are and driving long-term value. I'd say the best way to answer that question is, we have a very, disciplined capital allocation strategy. We will continue to look at use of cash. It's an active discussion between us and the Board. And right now okay we're authorized at $3 billion. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Okay, thank you, Mark. Thanks Aman. Aman Bhutani : Thank you. Christie Masoner : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Naved Khan from Truist. Naved, please go ahead. Naved Khan : Yeah. Hi. Thank you. Maybe I just wanted to just -- can you talk about the price increase that you're testing? You said you're kind of discounting less. Is that sort of the way you're thinking about it? Are you also doing explicit price increases to your existing base of customers? How should we understand this from the outside looking in? And then I don't know if you touched on this already, I joined a little late but maybe just talk about demand trends and monthly -- in terms of just month-on-month, did you see any changes through the course of the quarter? How does July look like? Any color would be helpful. Aman Bhutani : Yeah. On the pricing, so I think there was a specific example for Websites + Marketing pricing in the earlier question. But let me pull it back, Naved, a little bit and talk about -- remember our pricing is nuanced not just by geographies or customer shifts with macro but also customer populations. So I think in the past you and I have talked about how for certain populations, for example, are the main investor customer, the pricing that we will have will be different from let's say a micro business customer. So we take a look at all of that. That's the testing that happens, right? Then when we find the best balance of that versus share depending on geography, depending on customer population you see us roll those out. And I think Mark can comment on it but those get built into our plan and into our forecast basically. So we're -- it's not a single event type thing. We have a large broad portfolio of products. So we're constantly evaluating and doing tests and seeing where we should take price. And typically we're taking price after we have added more value for the customer, right? We want to continue to push the willingness to pay up and then take price so that the surplus for the consumer continues to be maintained and the customer stay super happy with us. And then I think you had a question about -- the second part was around the overall demand trends. I did comment a little bit about Europe being a bit weaker. But overall month-to-month there are some small shifts depending on different businesses, but we're not seeing a tidal wave change in any way. Mark McCaffrey : Yeah. And Naved, I'll add on the pricing part of it, right? Anything we plan on doing on pricing has been included in our forecast. And we always keep in mind that 85% of our revenue comes from our existing 21 million customers. And we're very, very particular about making sure that the pricing we do is matched up the value we're providing with them and we see it in our retention rates staying at a stronger at higher than 85%. Naved Khan : Got it. Thank you both. Christie Masoner : That concludes our Q&A for this session. I'm going to turn the call over to Aman for closing remarks. Aman Bhutani : Thank you Christie. I'll just say thank you all for joining and a big thank you to all GoDaddy employees around the world for another solid quarter.",

I'm Christie Masoner, Senior Director of Investor Relations. And with me today are Aman Bhutani, Chief Executive Officer; and Mark McCaffrey, Chief Financial Officer. Mark's voice may sound a bit scratchy today as he is currently under the weather. Following prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] On today's call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and operating metrics such as total bookings, unlevered free cash flow, normalized EBITDA, annualized recurring revenue or ARR, gross merchandise volume or GMV and net debt. Growth rates presented represent year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise noted. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents may be found in the presentation posted to our Investor Relations site at investors.godaddy.net or in today's earnings release on our Form 8-K furnished with the SEC. The matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements, which include those related to our future financial results, our strategies or objectives with respect to future operations, including our approach to capital allocation, new product introductions and innovations, and our ability to integrate acquisitions and achieve desired synergies. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today November rd3, 2022 and except to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. With that, here's Aman. Aman Bhutani : Thank you Christie, and thank you all for joining us today. At GoDaddy, our mission is to make opportunity more inclusive for all, championing micro and small business customers. One of our customers, Tyron Harper, co-owner of Harp Vision, was recently asked, what happens if Harp Vision doesn\u2019t succeed? His response was I never thought about it. I only thought about it succeeding. Every day we are inspired by our customers. I know we make a difference in their lives and in uncertain times our mission becomes even more important. None of us have a crystal ball to perfectly predict the future, but I can tell you that our customers are creative and resilient. In a recent survey, while more of our customers expressed a negative near-term outlook they generally remained a positive group with two-thirds of them reporting optimism about their business. Today, we are pleased to announce our Q3 results with 7% revenue growth, 15% growth in normalized EBITDA, and continued strong customer retention of more than 85%. These achievements are noteworthy given the continued negative foreign currency impact, uneven demand patterns, and lower consumer confidence. Our core competitive advantages of high global brand awareness to attract customers, sage guidance through Care to help retain customers, and seamlessly intuitive experiences to deliver mission-critical products and services to our customers uniquely position GoDaddy to weather economic challenges from a position of strength. While we are not immune to economic turbulence, we are committed to action and attention on what we can control. As in previous quarters, we will be prudent with our cost structure. Day to day, that comes down to focusing on success-based marketing, monitoring headcount and directing investments on the most important growth initiatives, including simplification and automation. This formula helps us deliver a great service efficiently. Maintaining strong cohort retention, driving new customer adds, increasing ARPU and extending commerce and payments attach are all important to achieving our long-term goals. In Q3, we continued to drive strong retention that is in-line with our past cohort performance. This demonstrates that through the varying economic cycles over the past couple of years, we successfully attracted the customers that have the right intent, those customers that can grow and attach more with us over time thus benefiting GoDaddy\u2019s ARPU. On gross adds, the data over the last few months suggests that there was a pull-forward during peak COVID times, though the magnitude of this is hard to calculate until normal seasonality returns to the business. As a result, gross adds and domains under management are not expected to follow the same historical arc as in recent years. Countering this, we are encouraged by our ability to maintain strong retention, increase ARPU, and continue the growth and momentum we are driving in our commerce and payments business within our existing customer base. Our strategic priorities remain consistent; first, driving commerce through presence; second, delivering for GoDaddy Pros; and third, innovating in domains. Beginning with presence, this quarter we added simplified site creation through improved guidance on template selection, making it easier for customers to start building an online presence. This update drove higher publish rates, which is an important indicator of customer success and increased lifetime value. You have heard me regularly talk about bringing Commerce to every surface at GoDaddy. Keeping with that, we have enabled payments in all Websites + Marketing plans, including our free plan. This shows up in the form of \u2018Buy Buttons\u2019 making it easier for nascent businesses, side-hustles, and the like to get started with our Commerce offering. Our goal here is to build the Commerce relationship with our customers as early as possible and then expand this relationship over time. These customers want a simple, inexpensive way to start taking payments. This functionality allows for that, while providing the lowest-in-industry online transaction rate of 2.3% +$0.30. Lastly, we recently celebrated the one-year anniversary of our OmniCommerce solution, and I wanted to spend a moment to acknowledge all that we have accomplished in this area since the release. We have been very ambitious in building out these capabilities because our customers tell us that they prefer a single one-stop shop solution. We believe our connected commerce solution is poised to win at a greater rate because it is adding value for our customers while saving them time and money. We made notable updates in user experience, eCommerce value and a disruptive payments experience. We added in-store, point-of-sale and Online Store inventory sync with omni-channel reporting for merchants across all channels. Our customers can clearly see their sales across their physical store, their online store, third party marketplaces and social media platforms including Amazon, Etsy, Walmart.com and others. We've added Pay Buttons, integrated shipping labels, Apple Pay and a new Commerce Plus plan for Websites + Marketing, for up and running businesses that need sales tax automation. And our customers can use Mobile app QR Code Payments and Apple Pay for eCommerce. We have also expanded our payments and commerce experience into Woo Commerce for Managed WordPress, while also actively rolling out our Managed Woo Commerce Stores solution allowing us to serve larger customers. We started with larger customers doing up to a million dollars in sales, and we are finding that we can effectively serve high single digit million sellers as well, and we already have these customers in our base. It is still early days but we have made good progress in identifying, converting and activating these larger sellers. Attaching to our existing base is key to our long-term ambition with GoDaddy Commerce and GoDaddy Payments. We are learning a lot about the sales and implementation cycle to serve these customers and we will provide more updates over time. We know that customers who engage in commerce and payments are generally stickier and have over 80x higher lifetime value. We have continued to see positive momentum in new customers attaching GoDaddy Payments within in Websites + Marketing and Managed WordPress. These serve as consistent proof points that our customers want this capability from us, and it can fuel our growth and customer retention for years to come. Moving on to GoDaddy Pros, this quarter we launched free SSL on nearly all new web hosting plans in our major markets including the US, UK, Canada, Australia and India. Early data shows that this is driving increased term lengths and modest improvements in new units and bookings in our hosting business. While the macro and FX challenges on our hosting business are meaningful, we are focused on what we can control, making the product better for our customers. Along with free SSL, we have continued to improve server response time by rolling out infrastructure improvements across multiple hosting platforms. We have also continued to update GoDaddy's Pro Hub, putting a more competitive offering in the marketplace. Our hosting business in Europe is also exposed to rising energy costs and to mitigate that we secured a fixed power contract. Our third priority is innovation in Domains. The rollout of Payable Domains is going well with half of our domains now technically enabled as payable and ready for activation by customers. The first cohort of existing customers we exposed Payable Domains to were logged in domain plus email customers. These customers were identified as likely to have high intent and they have engaged with Payable Domains at an attractive rate. It is still too early to calculate how much usage Payable Domains will have for non-website customers, but we are encouraged by this beginning and moving as quickly as we can to merchandise it to more customers. We also released a new Auctions user experience that improves the buying experience with new bulk bidding and Buy-It-Now options, improved uptime, and a simpler and consistent design. We also launched a Domain Portfolio Manager for all customers giving them modern domain management capabilities aimed at increasing their efficiency and ease of use. While we are learning more about how the macro environment impacts the Aftermarket, we continue to focus on what we control, which is to improve the experience for domain investor customers and integrate Dan.com\u2019s capabilities into the broader GoDaddy secondary market. In closing, we look forward to finishing the year steadfast in our commitment of executing against our strategic priorities and working to achieve our long-term financial goals. As we think ahead to next year and beyond, we continue to be a leader in our space, with ample growth opportunities and the ability to participate in our customers\u2019 success. History has shown that companies that continue to innovate and invest appropriately during an economic downturn can exit the other side in an even better position. We will stay close to our customers, we will understand their greatest needs and we will delight them with guided Care, constantly innovating towards a seamless experience making our solutions stickier leading to greater customer lifetime value. With that, here's Mark. Mark McCaffrey : Thanks Aman and thank you everyone for joining us today. In Q3, GoDaddy delivered solid results despite increasing currency and macroeconomic headwinds. Revenue was $1.03 billion, growing 7% on a reported basis and 9% on a constant currency basis. Within total revenue, international revenue grew 4% on a reported basis, and 9% on a constant currency basis. Applications and Commerce revenue grew 13%, within the guided range of 13 to 15% on the strength of our Create + Grow and our Commerce products as well as email attach. The ARR for Applications and Commerce grew 10% to more than $1.2 billion and within that, the ARR from our Create and Grow products grew 7% to nearly $430 million. Additionally, annualized GMV across the GoDaddy ecosystem grew 10% to approximately $29 billion. Core Platform revenue grew 5%, within the target range of 4% to 6%, primarily due to growth in the Aftermarket and increased pricing in domains, offset by a modest decrease in our hosting business. As Aman noted above, the hosting business has concentration and exposure to uneven demand in Europe as well as FX pressure. ARR for Core Platform grew 2% to $2.3 billion. Q3 Bookings totaled $1.09 billion, growing 5% on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis. Applications and Commerce bookings grew 10% and Core Platform bookings grew 3% on similar growth factors noted for revenue. Normalized EBITDA grew 15% to $263 million, a margin rate of 25%, representing a 180 basis point expansion, year-over-year. Continued discipline in spending allowed us to increase our margins at a rate higher than our bookings. Unlevered Free Cash Flow for the quarter totaled $297 million, growing 18% driven by strong profitability. Additionally, year-to-date we completed $1.15 billion of share buybacks, repurchasing 14.8 million shares, and reducing our fully diluted share count by approximately 9% since year end. Free cash flow per share rose to $5.96 on a trailing twelve-month basis, versus prior year cash flow per share of $4.94, a 21% increase driven by strong cash flow and share repurchases. On the balance sheet, we finished Q3 with $826 million in cash and total liquidity of $1.4 billion. Net debt stands at $3.1 billion, at the midpoint of our targeted leverage range of two to four times. Additionally, in October, we announced a new term loan facility of $1.8 billion, the proceeds of which are to be used to pay down our existing term loans due in 2024. The pending term loan facility contemplates a maturity date of 2029 and pricing based on SOFR + 325 basis points. We also announced our intent to increase the borrowing capacity under our existing $600 million revolving credit facility to a $1 billion facility maturing in 2027. These transactions, which are scheduled to close in Q4, are subject to customary closing conditions and would meaningfully increase our total liquidity. The cash interest payments under these transactions would increase our interest payments by roughly $35 million for 2023, resulting in expected annual interest of approximately $165 million. Moving on to our outlook, we are targeting Q4 total revenue in the range of $1.03 billion to $1.05 billion, representing growth of 2% year-over-year at the midpoint. As we previously discussed, the macro environment and FX has shifted since our initial guide in February. Additionally, we are facing a tough compare in our Aftermarket business. While our Aftermarket business showed strength in the fourth quarter last year, the demand for high value sales has been difficult to predict due to its short lead times and fast close rates. Our current guide does not factor in the same strength we experienced last year due to the current macro trends. Said simply, we do not expect Aftermarket demand in Q4 to enable the same revenue out performance we achieved in the year-ago quarter. Also, assuming a continuation of today\u2019s currency rates, we expect the adverse FX impact will be an incremental $5 million from our Q2 guide, for an incremental $40 million adverse impact from our initial February guide. Flowing through these factors into our segments, we expect some impact to our Applications and Commerce segment from uneven demand experienced in September and October. As a result, we expect this segment to grow between 10% and 12% for Q4 putting Applications and Commerce revenue growth at the low to mid-end of our range of 13% to 15% for the year. In Core Platform we expect revenue to be flat to slightly down year-over-year in Q4 on the impacts of Hosting and FX pressure mentioned previously as well as a tough compare in Aftermarket, which results in Core Platform revenue growth between 4 and 6% for the full year. Normalized EBITDA for Q4 is expected to be in the range of $250 million to $260 million and remain within the targeted range of 24% to 25% for both the quarter and the year end, above our initial range of 23% to 24% provided in February. We expect our unlevered free cash flow for the year to be between $1.09 and $1.1 billion, putting our cash flow per share at $6 plus in line with the outlook shared in February. Our capital allocation strategy is unchanged. We continued our buyback program during Q3 and will continue to evaluate use-of-cash options for the remainder of the year, in line with our disciplined capital allocation framework. Our attractive model and robust free cash flow provide us the flexibility to continue to invest in our business at a time when others may have to pull back more aggressively, and to return cash to shareholders through our buyback program. At the same time, we remain disciplined on how and where we spend, with a focus on controlling our costs, optimizing our marketing spend, monitoring headcount and investing in tech so that we can strike the right balance between capturing attractive opportunities with delivering profits to our shareholders. Always with an eye towards balanced long-term growth and profitability. On our cost structure, last quarter we shared that we are focused on acting in areas we could control. Committed to that goal, we executed a couple of important contracts to reduce or mitigate exposure to increased costs. In Q4, we expanded our relationship with Amazon Web Services to continue to migrate workloads and development to the cloud. This contract will reduce our overall costs in the form of long-term capital spend and energy expenses while giving us the agility to launch new products at a faster pace. On energy costs, as Aman mentioned earlier, we secured a contract in Europe at a guaranteed rate for the next year, giving us mid-term stability on these costs impacting our European data centers. Lastly, as noted earlier, we are currently refinancing our 2024 debt to extend our due date to 2029 and limit our exposure to further interest rate increases. Through this anticipated new debt, we continue to expect our leverage ratio to remain between two to four times. We are committed to remaining transparent, and we will provide an update with our latest thoughts on key business trends when we share our 2023 guidance early next year. Like so many other companies, we are operating in a fluid environment and are not immune to its challenges. In closing, while the short-term revenue outlook is dynamic, we have continued confidence in our ability to execute. We believe our competitive position and strategic advantages, our diverse product offerings, our strong balance sheet and the consistent and predictable cash flow we generate places GoDaddy as a leader amongst its peers. While the range of outcomes is somewhat wider today than at points in the past, we are creating a track record as a responsible management team that can and will lead in good times and in tougher times, allowing our business to perform across economic cycles. Our 21 million customers create the foundation for our resiliency. We will continue to focus on execution against our strategic priorities, tightly managing our business and building deeper customer relationships as we partner alongside entrepreneurs on their journey. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Aman. Aman Bhutani : Thanks Mark. Taking a step back, we are incredibly proud of the work our teams are doing as we are making progress against our stated priorities. GoDaddy has a proven, focused strategy, executed by an experienced team that will act proactively and decisively through a fluid macro-economic environment to create long-term value for shareholders. Despite these headwinds and the tough compare in Q4, the full year is on track to deliver 7% growth or 9% on a constant currency basis. Coupled with the momentum we are driving in commerce, we are excited about what\u2019s to come in 2023 and beyond. With that, we will have Christie Masoner from our Investor Relations team to open up the call for questions. A - Christie Masoner : Thanks Aman. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Elizabeth Porter from Morgan Stanley. Elizabeth please go ahead. Elizabeth Porter : Hi, thank you so much. Obviously, macro is definitely softening. But I was hoping you could provide some color on just how the top of the funnel has changed from Q2 to Q3, and this far into Q4. And last quarter, you did speak about Europe as being a particular area of weakness? And has that trend extended more broadly to the US and any other geographies? Thank you. Aman Bhutani : Thanks, Elizabeth, this is Aman. I'm happy to take that question. When we talk about the unevenness of demand or the broader macro, if we take a step back, it's been kind of uneven for two plus years, Mark mentioned, sort of some of the September/October data as well. But I, when I look back, I see us navigating the last two years really well, our cohorts have continued to be consistent at about 85% retention or higher, and here we are without sort of, we came into 2022 with uncertainty. And it has been there has been quite a lot of uncertainty where we're sitting at 9%, constant currency revenue growth and expanding margins. We're taking all of that momentum with us into 2023. Are there regions of an unevenness by geography, like you said, or by month or by customer segment? Yes, that's absolutely there. And just to touch on Europe a bit, as we did last quarter, it's broadly similar, as we talked about last quarter, in the UK, in Germany are big markets for us there. So, clearly, we feel a bigger impact there. But we're watching the US very, very carefully. And we're watching our cohorts very, very quick, carefully. But we're taking all this momentum into 2023 and we're excited, we got a lot of new product on the table, a lot of new capabilities that in commerce and payments, WordPress improvements payable domains registry, like there's so much for us to look forward to that. I think we're just going to watch the numbers very carefully and make good decisions. And I'll turn it to Mark, I don't know, Mark, if you'd like to add something? Mark McCaffrey : No, I think that's a good response. Aman, and just kind of bringing it home. I think it's more pronounced in Europe, no doubt, in UK, and Germany, like Amman mentioned, but then overall, looking at Q4 and the outperformance of aftermarket last year versus this year, we're not seeing the same demand around the larger deals, we see a lot of supply and demand. But these things are short to come and quick to close. And we've taken that out of our guide for Q4, because we just don't see it in front of us right now. So, I think that when you talk about demand overall, that's something you have to call out. Elizabeth Porter : Got it. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up, you guys have always focused on attracting customers that could attach more product and have that higher LTV. And just in the current environment, what sort of changes are you seeing in the willingness to attach additional products or buy bundled solutions? One point -- one hand budgets might be tighter, but then the other hand there is an opportunity just to do more with a single platform versus any sort of smaller point solutions you might have looked at in the past. Thanks. Aman Bhutani : Yes, I'm happy to quickly touch on that. First, overall, our cohorts are performing consistently, ARPU is rising and continues to do well obviously we'll talk about it more at the end of the year. But our focus is to attract the customers with the right intent that want to use activate the products that we have. So that we continue to maintain that high customer retention rate. And as long as those cohorts form and customers are retained, we know that in any short to mid-term cycles may push customer demand up or down a bit. But over the long-term customers need the products we have. We deliver critical products to them at amazing prices and we know these products are core to their needs. So, short-term up and down is okay. But overall, I think ARPU -- the ARPU, numbers are showing that we're attracting the right customer. Mark McCaffrey : And Aman, I'll add. I think the one-stop shop, the area is really coming to play. And I know we've talked about commerce and the attach we're seeing at the front of the funnel. But we're also seeing the competitive pricing in our existing customer base start to take hold. And I think Elizabeth going to your to your question, it really shows that in this market, dealing with a one-stop shop is a competitive advantage, and we're seeing customers really be attracted to that, not only new customers, but existing customers as well. Elizabeth Porter : Great. Thank you so much. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Trevor Young from Barclays. Trevor, please go ahead. Trevor Young : Great. Thanks. First, just more of a housekeeping one to start since investors have been asking. Just where did we finish the quarter in terms of domains under management relative to the $83.8 million reported last quarter. And then second one on aftermarket, Mark, maybe could you give us any sort of data points in terms of like percentage of total revenue or growth rate in the quarter or even contribution to overall core platform growth to just kind of help us size where we're at with that business? Aman Bhutani : Yes. For the doms, Trevor, it will be in our Q tomorrow, so you'll see it. And I referenced a bit in my prepared remarks, about some of the pull forward and what we're seeing with gross adds. So there will be some change in terms of the arc of doms. We will see the details in the Q. And Mark, I'll turn it to you for the second part of the question. Mark McCaffrey : Yes. When you look at the Q4, it's about 2% of the aftermarket contribution that we had last year that we haven't built into this year. Trevor, hopefully, that allows you to size it a bit. Trevor Young : Okay. Great. And then a bigger picture one, Aman. Just on like the Managed WordPress, WooCommerce stores, you mentioned going after some of the larger customers and maybe a few million of revs or high single-digit revs. Is that -- those conversions, are they typically coming from a modern competitive solution? Or are they legacy GoDaddy customers that were maybe like a domains and Managed WordPress customer, but had their own payments or commerce integration. And now to your earlier remarks kind of bringing it all into one house, one-stop shop? Aman Bhutani : Yes. It's still very early, Trevor, in terms of us reaching into our base and attracting customers that sell multiple single-digit millions of dollars -- multiple single million dollars in sales. What I would say we're seeing a bit of everything right now, but the offering we're taking to them is the one-stop shop from their in-store capabilities to their online. They can go to one screen. They can see Amazon, Etsy, Walmart.com, their physical store and all the inventory things and they have it at an amazing price point for our GoDaddy payments just 2.3% plus $0.30 online. We're really got a great package to approach them with. And what we're seeing is interest and good conversion with our new capabilities. And we'll talk much more about our Managed WooCommerce stores product. That's really targeting these larger sellers. And again, it's still early, but you'll see it in general release very, very quickly, and the pilot continues to go well, sort of -- and we're encouraged by the green shoots there. Trevor Young : Great. Thank you both. Aman Bhutani : Thanks, Trevor. I think maybe we will ask Christie, I think the next question is from Matt. Matt, do you want to go ahead? Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Great. Thanks. Thank you. I wanted to ask on the presence market. How do you think you're growing relative to the market? Are you seeing share up flat or down? And then some of your competitors in that area have made some material changes to how they're thinking about spending? Has that had any impact on your business? Aman Bhutani : Yes. Overall, we look at our create and grow products and are quite encouraged with the continued progress there. As we've shared in the past, websites plus marketing, particularly has continued to grow well and really fits a need for our type of customer. The micro business that wants to get up and running faster and website so marketing just produces a really, really good, high performing website for them very, very quickly. So I think we're really encouraged by that. In terms of directional changes from competitors, I think it's still pretty early. We haven't seen a ton of change overall. But our prices for those products are very, very competitive. So we're definitely keeping an eye on it. Unidentified Analyst : Great. And just on the -- Mark, you called out some areas that you've heard some things you've done to drive some cost savings. If the macro continues to worsen into next year, how do you think about making other cost adjustments? And where would those cost adjustments be? Mark McCaffrey : Yes. Thanks. And we don't have a crystal ball into next year. And obviously, we don't know if FX is going to be a tailwind or a headwind and continue to watch the depth and the breadth of the recession, especially in Europe. So, a lot of moving parts there. We look quarter-to-quarter. We look at the leverage in our operating expenses. I think we've talked about that before about how we can obtain leverage. We feel really good about the actions we've taken or are taking in Q4 to manage some of that risk. For example, we talked about the energy contract, the AWS contract. But we continue to look at what's in front of us, what we can do, what's within our control. We can find leverage in G&A and care. Obviously, we continue to get more efficient with marketing. I think even in this year, when you take a step back and you look at where we started to where we finished on our normalized EBITDA margin expansion, it's obviously something we are very focused on and continuing to manage as we go through this environment. Unidentified Analyst : Perfect. Thanks for taking my questions. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Zgutowicz from Benchmark. Mark, please go ahead. Aman Bhutani : Hey, Mark. Mark Zgutowicz : Hey, Christie, Aman and Mark, will question on payable domains. Curious -- I know it's really early here, but I'm curious what sort of are the KPIs that you're looking at initially here? And how long before you will know whether or not there's a payments activation or a potential payments activation to be made? You've got obviously lots of data that you look at in your marketing is always very focused on high-intent attached users. So I'm sort of curious on what data points you're looking for initially? And then just on Apple Pay, maybe very high level, but I'm just curious how you think about how that will contribute to GMV over time? And maybe specifically, if you look at Apple Pay itself as a driver of cart conversion. But just any high-level thoughts there would be helpful. Thank you. Aman Bhutani : Yes, happy to take that, Mark. Just to bring it up a level, if you remember how we introduced GoDaddy payments into websites plus marketing, the first set of metrics we talked about is what percentage of customers were attaching GoDaddy payments to websites plus marketing. It's very similar for payable domains or other services where we're bringing in payments, where the first step we're looking at is when we put this capability in front of new customers, what percentage of those customers sign up for it, take it on. And then, of course, we want to see what percentage of those customers activated and then what GPV they'll transact. What we're doing a little bit differently for payable domains is that at the same time, we've started to expose it to cohorts of customers that are already in our base. So that's one of the examples that I used in my prepared remarks where you can imagine customers that have domain plus e-mail with us, they don't have a website with us. They have domain plus e-mail and they come in to make whatever changes on the website or to their account. And what we're doing is we're catching them at that moment. And we're saying, hey, here's a new thing that's available to you, would you like to try it out? And we saw an attractive percentage of those customers sign up for that and say, yes, I'd like to use it. So in terms of exact time line, I can't tell you how many weeks or months it might take to sort of get an idea. But what we're looking for is those customers and just like new customers in the existing base starting to activate the payable capability, use the failing and then see over time what GPV flows through it. But obviously, we have a large base, and we now have this available for 50% of our domains in the US, which is where we have payments. So it's quite a large opportunity we're going after. And in terms of Apple Pay, I think it's just too early to talk about what changes we might see. We're learning more about that relationship and executing towards it, but it's too early to talk about that. Mark Zgutowicz : Okay. Thanks, Mark. Appreciate it. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from Evercore ISI. Mark, please go ahead. Jian Li : Hey, guys. Thanks for question. This is Jian Li from Mark Mahaney. Maybe a couple of questions. One is just to circle back on the macro environment. Can you just kind of talk about the demand trends in terms of like the larger users the Pros versus the SMBs? Are the Pros holding up better or is it kind of equal impact across the board? And another question on operating perhaps like on the flip side, I've just kind of noticed a pretty impressive marketing leverage that you guys have had over the past few quarters. I think this is another record low. So if you can kind of talk about, just given the visibility of GoDaddy's core business, given your cash flow position, it almost seems that perhaps there's an opportunity to lean in to marketing if the pricing CPMs are favorable. So if you can talk about the marketing environment you're seeing right now? And kind of how do you think about the spend trajectory? Are you expecting to hold it at this level or be opportunistic? Mark McCaffrey : I guess, I'll start to handle some of that. Okay. Sorry, all right. Aman Bhutani : Yes. Sorry, Mark, I was already talking on mute, but if I could jump in. Mark McCaffrey : Go ahead. Go ahead, Aman. Aman Bhutani : I think I've got three separate questions there, and maybe, Mark, you can grab a bit of the last one. But just very quickly, Jian, thanks for the questions. On Pros and SMBs, keep in mind, we -- a lot of the Pros that work with GoDaddy tend to be in our hosting business, and that's disproportionately sort of impacted by FX and European exposure. So what we see there has been significant. Mark talked about our international revenue growing 4% and the five points impact of FX there, would have been 9% constant currency. So we definitely see those shifts. But overall, the broader macro, I would say, it's is impacting all kinds of customers in a similar way. But the most important thing for us is that the customers that we bring in continue to have the right intent because what we're really watching is every quarter customer that would bring in, every channel that they come from, are we getting the right renewal rates for those customers because that's what really creates lifetime value for the company. It's not the fast customer that we can just get for a low price that is going to churn very, very quickly. And in terms of marketing leverage, we've talked about it a little bit in the past of how we have pushed all of our marketing channels into sort of the success-based thinking. And it comes in many flavors. It comes in incrementality testing. It comes in sort of AB testing even based on geos. It comes in AB testing in terms of bidding and search, which I've talked about before. And by being very focused on gathering the data, and executing to what the test show, we have been able to trim our marketing spend and focusing on areas that bring us the best returns with the best intent customers. And in terms of leaning into marketing and doing more there, absolutely, I always say I would love to spend more in marketing every time. I just want it to continue to deliver the returns that we're asking for. So as long as it's within our guidelines, we definitely look for new channels, new areas where we can spend up more and attract more customers. And Mark, I'll turn it to you. I'm not sure, if what I interrupt you. Mark McCaffrey : Yes. No, no. I think you covered a lot of it, Aman, and I think you hit the high points, but I'll add. We continue to look at marketing as a tool based on the ROI we see in front of us. And we're always balancing our decisions today and how we invest while keeping an eye on the long term and our stated objectives. So we're trying to be disciplined in our approach, but yet look for the ROI and the opportunity to take advantage of it when it comes. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Mili Das on behalf of Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe Research. Mili, please go ahead. Mili Das : Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I was wondering, if you could provide more color on fiscal year 2023. I know you guys are still in the planning process, but are there any key priorities we should be thinking about into next year? And can we expect any large investment initiatives? Thank you. Mark McCaffrey : So we're looking forward to talking to everybody early next year about our 2023 outlook, but I'll give it a step back here in talk about kind of 2022 and where we're going and the momentum we have going into 2023. When we talk about \u2013 our first meeting this year on Investor Day, we had a lot of momentum going into the year, but we couldn't predict the macroeconomic environment that was out there. As we sit here today, we're looking at, targeting 7% growth for the year, 9% on constant currency, and we really like the momentum going into 2023 as it stands. Even in Q4, we always knew Q4 was going to be a tough comparable for us but you take the growth rate, you added a couple of points for FX. You add a couple of points for the aftermarket over performance that we've taken out, and we really have a lot of momentum going in around our products and some of the stuff Aman has talked about. So, looking forward to talking a little bit more as we get into 2023, and what we're seeing out there. But right now, we are really happy with how we're performing in 2022 and the momentum we have. And just to add to that, being able to expand our normalized EBITDA margins during this period and at the same time hit our cash flow targets and cash flow per share targets, we like the long-term outlook out there. Mili Das : Great. Thank you so much. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Bolton on behalf of Aaron Kessler from Raymond James. Alex, please go ahead. Aaron Kessler : I think, it actually Aaron. Hey, guys. Mark McCaffrey : Hey, Aaron. Aaron Kessler : Can you just talk about maybe the \u2013 talk a little bit about the shift to cloud and kind of what's your progress in terms of that shift to cloud services and the impact on OpEx that we should be thinking about over the next year or so? Aman Bhutani : Yes. I'm happy to share, Aaron that we've continued to shift more of our applications into the cloud. It gives us a much stronger ability to \u2013 and greater velocity to put more products out there much, much faster and manage scale much, much better. I'll let Mark talk about sort of some of the OpEx CapEx type sort of change there. But overall, we're very happy with the relationship we have. We've just renegotiated a contract. Our teams work very well together, and almost all of our teams are using the cloud in some way, shape or form. Mark, I'll turn to you for OpEx. Mark McCaffrey : All right. Thanks. Hi, Aaron, how are you doing? Listen, early on, and we'll get more clarity as we talk to you in early 2023, but the way I would look at it right now is, we have pressure around increased energy costs, especially coming out of Europe right now. We talked about the contract we signed to secure our cost for next year. But the AWS contract really allows us to negate any future impacts around energy costs. And I think from an operating expense point of view, we're looking at it to kind of cover us as we go into 2023, if that makes any sense. Aaron Kessler : Yes, it does. Great. Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Naved Khan from Truist. Naved, please go ahead. Hi, Naved. I think you are on mute. Naved Khan : Can you hear me? Christie Masoner : We can hear you now. Naved Khan : Great. Yes. So two questions. One, are any of the costs associated with your European business kind of based out of the US or in US dollars that might be hurting the margin somewhat. And the other question is just around the price testing you guys have been doing, any \u2013 are you seeing any stickiness in that any kind of pushback? Any color would be great? Thanks. Mark McCaffrey : Yes, nothing to really call out in the data centers and the US dollars or the EMEA part of it. A lot of our European customers are based on European data centers. So obviously, there is some FX impact, but nothing really to call out too significant on the margins. Aman Bhutani : And then on price testing, Naved, we've continued to test price. And you'll continue to see us do it where we continue to be nuanced in our approach on pricing looking to balance both what's happening sort of macro-economically or within a geo versus also our ability to take share and push in versus take price. So we'll continue to make -- do that approach and we'll continue to guide to the plans that we have, for example, for 2023, you'll hear about them. They'll be within the \u2013 as we talk about 2023 in February. Naved Khan : Okay. Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of John Van [ph] on behalf of Brent Thill from Jefferies. John, please go ahead. Hi, John, I think you are un-mute. Unidentified Analyst : A -couple of questions, one more on the macro. It does seem like the tone get a little bit more cautious and just wondering, how they've progressed maybe over time in October? And where are you seeing some of the more incremental caution? And then the second question, on the payable domains, I know it's early, but wondering how the behavior is the first time they turn it on and it just trying it out? Or is it like follow-on usage? Any sort of anecdotal that would be great. Aman Bhutani : Yes. Thanks, John. Maybe taking the second part first. On payable domains, it's super early. What I talked about in my prepared remarks is that in the US, we have now technically enabled half the domains under management as payable. We still have to put that in merchandise that to customers and activate them. But I give an example or 2 of how we're doing that both in the new path and in the existing customers, engaging them. So we're very excited about getting this capability to customer, very excited about some of the attach rates we're seeing. But in terms of customers actually starting to use it and GPV flowing, it will take a little bit of time for us to truly understand what that usage is going to look like. And to take a step back to talk about the overall macro, I think the word that describes it well is that it's been an uneven macro environment for two-plus years now, right? And I'm really proud of what the GoDaddy team has achieved and what we've been able to do. I feel we've navigated that environment very, very well. We've attracted great customers. We continue to have greater than 85% retention rates for customers. We're sitting \u2013 we came into 2022 with a lot of uncertainty as well. And we're sitting here with 9% constant currency revenue growth and lots of new products coming into the market in commerce and payments, we word press with websites plus marketing having plan down to even the free plan with payable domains with the registry business. So it's just a lot of good for us to look forward to. And we're taking all of that momentum with us into 2023. And we've highlighted the areas where we see some risks, and we always call it like we see it. right? But at the core, GoDaddy is a market leader. We have a durable business. Our customers are resilient, which leads to us having a resilient business. Our core competitive advantages around our unmatched scale Sage guidance we gave in customer care, that customer care is great for us to attach products, and we'll give you examples of that. And we're building technology that works for our customer for the micro and small business, which is seamless, which is intuitive which helps saves them time, help save them money. And we have pricing like example payments that -- or even in websites marketing, that is very, very competitive in the market. And ultimately, we put the customer at the center of what we're doing. We're staying close to the customer. We're pruning stewards of the P&L. We're investing in areas that are the biggest growth initiatives for us as a company. And we're running the business for long-term profitable and sustainable growth. That's sort of our view, and that's how we see it. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you for the color. Aman Bhutani : Thank you. Christie Masoner : I will now turn the call over to Aman for any closing remarks. Aman Bhutani : Thank you, Christie. Thank you all for your questions. Thank you to all GoDaddy employees for all the hard work for another good quarter, and I look forward to talking to you next time. Thank you.",

    "content": "\ufeff Christie Masoner : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for GoDaddy's Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2022 Earnings Call. I'm Christie Masoner, Senior Director of Investor Relations, and with me today are Aman Bhutani, Chief Executive Officer; and Mark McCaffrey, Chief Financial Officer. Following prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] On today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results and operating and business metrics such as total bookings, unlevered free cash flow, free cash flow, normalized EBITDA, annualized recurring revenue or ARR, gross merchandise volume or GMV, gross payments volume or GPV, and net debt. Growth rates presented represent year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise noted. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents may be found in the presentation posted to investors.godaddy.net or in today\u2019s earnings release included in our Form 8-K filed with the SEC. The matters we\u2019ll be discussing today include forward-looking statements, which include those related to our future financial results, our strategies or objectives with respect to future operations, including our approach to capital allocation, new product introductions and innovations, and our ability to integrate acquisitions and achieve desired synergies. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today February 14, 2023 and except to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to update these statements, because of new information or future events. With that, here\u2019s Aman. Aman Bhutani : Thank you, Christie, and thank you all for joining us today. GoDaddy\u2019s mission is to make opportunity more inclusive for all. We achieve this by providing sage guidance and robust tools so our customers can have a one-stop shop with GoDaddy. GoDaddy is delivering tools that help our customers get online and start their digital journey, tools that merge the in-store and online experience for their customers and bring commerce to every surface. This empowers them to focus on running their business. Today, Mark and I will cover our 2022 financial results and key accomplishments in the context of our 3-year plan laid out at Investor Day last February. We will also share more information on our progress, especially in Commerce and the continued opportunity there and managing our P&L in the face of an uncertain macro environment. In 2022, GoDaddy delivered $4.1 billion in revenue, growing 8% on a constant currency basis and over $1 billion in Normalized EBITDA driving a 25% margin. Free cash flow increased 13% leading to a 22% increase in free cash flow per share of $6.20 higher than our 2022 targets. Our strategy, direction and priorities continue to be consistent with our 3-year plan as we work to empower new customers and our large base of existing customers with more of our product offerings, including enabling Commerce on every surface. I will go into a bit more detail in the Commerce priority section but just to touch on it now, in about 18 months, GoDaddy has added incredible new products to our lineup, including OmniCommerce offerings with Websites + Marketing and our newly launched SaaS solution, Managed WooCommerce Stores on WordPress, Payable Domains, Pay Links, Pay Buttons and much more. Our previously announced commerce offerings are now fully in market. And today, we are adding to that lineup with an exciting new partnership with FIS Worldpay, to be their preferred provider of OmniCommerce solutions for U.S.-based small business customers and bank partners. The teams are already working together, and we are receiving positive feedback from customers. We remain confident in the long-term growth potential we outlined last year in our 3-year plan, but also recognize that these top-line growth targets may be challenged in the short-term. As a result, we have taken some aggressive and disciplined actions in our cost structure that will result in over $100 million in annualized cost savings, preserving our ability to achieve profitability targets even in a weak economic environment. These actions include deeper integration of some of our acquired brands, an overall reduction in vendor spend and an 8% reduction in our global workforce. We will continue to make prudent and thoughtful investments in our top growth areas and priorities of driving commerce through presence, delivering for Web Pros and innovating in domains. As always, I will share a bit about our key priorities on this call and focus more on Commerce this time. On driving commerce through presence, at Investor Day we shared our vision of connected commerce, which is about bringing commerce to every surface. Our goal has been to launch products and capabilities to engage the commerce customer early in the lifecycle, which might be a Payable Domain or a Pay Button on a Websites + Marketing freemium website. We have made tremendous progress in this direction through the broad release of payments into our website builders, domains, Pay Links, Pay Buttons, and more. In Q4, we furthered our reach by enabling GoDaddy Payments, by default, in all new commerce websites. In January, we rolled out our payments by default out to new domain purchases. Most of our new offerings have been in market in the U.S. for less than a year and we are just starting to engage our base, so I am happy to share that our customers transacted $760 million of gross payment volume in 2022. GPV has been accelerating, and we are looking forward to sharing this metric with you regularly. We have also launched our new OmniCommerce SaaS offering on WooCommerce and WordPress, called Managed WooCommerce Stores. This product is targeted at the larger end of our micro-business customers, giving them the flexibility and ability to scale to their needs. Merchants can sell on a highly performant website, sell in-person using GoDaddy terminals, and via marketplace and social channels with shared payments and inventory. We are excited by the opportunity and potential this offering brings to customers who need a more robust solution. We are also leveraging our Managed WooCommerce Stores offering in our new partnership with FIS Worldpay. FIS Worldpay is a market-leading merchant services provider, and we will be their preferred provider of OmniCommerce solutions for U.S.-based small business customers and bank partners. FIS Worldpay provides payment strategies and technologies to over 1,400 financial institutions, including more than 700 credit unions throughout the U.S., supporting over 33 million debit cards and processing more than 15.7 billion transactions each year. Bringing together FIS Worldpay\u2019s reach, and our commerce products will create a significant new offering in the marketplace. And briefly on supporting GoDaddy Pros, we have continued to improve our product offering and have started to integrate more deeply some of our acquired brands. While these projects are complex, they will lead to a much better customer experience and lower costs. For one of our key brands, Media Temple, we informed all customers in December 2022 and will be sunsetting the brand over the next 3 months. And while I already mentioned our new OmniCommerce SaaS offering, we are actively testing price points that best appeal to our Web Pros customers and audience. Our third priority is innovating in domains and we continue to add value into our aftermarket platform. In Q4, our Dan.com integration reached a critical milestone 6 months ahead of schedule by launching Dan listings on our Afternic platform. All Dan users currently opted-in for the distribution network will now benefit from greater exposure as their inventory is automatically integrated into the Afternic domain listing service network. This milestone was accompanied by numerous other enhancements such as bid and offer history that further optimized the aftermarket experience. Payable Domains is 100% enabled in the U.S. and will be ramping up the marketing launch in a couple of weeks. As you recall, Payable Domains are branded pay links that create a secure checkout page, shareable via a link, that enable U.S.-based domain name customers to begin accepting payments shortly after they purchase a newly registered domain, even if they do not yet have a website or online store. For any domain purchased, existing or new, customers can already access the respective Payable Domain through their GoDaddy Dashboard. Combining the ability to accept payments with the credibility of a domain name enables small businesses to get up and running easily and quickly. While this capability has been rolling over a few months, we\u2019re thrilled and ready to be fully in-market giving GoDaddy domain customers a truly differentiated domain with expanded payment capabilities. In closing, we are pleased with the quarterly and annual financial results we delivered, while operating in this difficult environment. More importantly, we are proud of our progress against the key initiatives that we outlined last year at our Investor Day. We remain incredibly excited for the future. We are building on our unique market leading position with identified, abundant, long-term opportunity, bringing together our customers\u2019 digital identity, their presence and connecting commerce to every surface. Being this one-stop shop for our customers is at the center of our strategy. We are committed to continuing our pace of innovation, participating in our customers\u2019 success, intently focused on delivering strong financial results, and as always growing shareholder value. With that, here\u2019s Mark. Mark McCaffrey : Thanks Aman. Hello, everyone, and thank you all for joining us. Last year, we hosted a comprehensive Investor Day, where we shared our financial goals for the coming 3 years around revenue growth, Normalized EBITDA, free cash flow per share and share buybacks. GoDaddy turned in a strong year against those financial goals, delivering revenue of $4.1 billion; Normalized EBITDA of $1 billion; free cash flow per share of $6.20 and executing $1.3 billion in share buybacks, meeting and exceeding our targets. While revenue growth has moderated in the short-term, we remain confident in our ability to deliver the profitability and cash flow we outlined at Investor Day and feel the strategic steps Aman described earlier will serve as tailwinds for accelerating our pace of growth going forward. We also remain committed to completing our share buybacks authorized by the Board last year. Reviewing our annual financial results, total revenue was $4.1 billion in 2022, growing 7%. Excluding a point and a half of FX headwind, total revenue for the year would have grown over 8% on a constant currency basis. Applications and commerce revenue for the year grew to $1.3 billion, representing 13% growth, and Core platform revenue for the year totaled $2.8 billion, representing 5% growth, both in line with the targets we set last year. International revenue was $1.3 billion for the year, representing 5% growth. Excluding the FX impact, international growth would have been 8% on a constant currency basis. Total bookings in 2022 was $4.4 billion, growing 4%, or 6% on a constant currency basis. Full year unlevered free cash flow grew to $1.1 billion, representing 14% growth, in line with our guide issued last year. Free cash flow grew 13% to $969 million. Free cash flow per share increased 22% to $6.20 per share, ahead of our investor day target of $6. Lastly, full year Normalized EBITDA grew 16% topping $1 billion, resulting in a 25% margin for the year, which is an expansion of 2 points over the prior year. Moving on to our fourth quarter results, total revenue topped $1 billion, growing 2%, or 4% on a constant currency basis. International revenue grew 3%, or 8% on a constant currency basis. Applications and commerce revenue grew 11% to $333 million, in line with the guided range of 10% to 12% for the quarter. Growth in Applications and Commerce was fueled by continued adoption of our Create and Grow products, email attach, and increasingly the adoption of GoDaddy payments and the related hardware sales. The ARR for applications and commerce grew 9% to $1.3 billion. With that, the ARR from our create and grow products grew 8% to $445 million. Additionally, annualized GMV across the GoDaddy ecosystem grew 10% to approximately $28 billion. Furthering our efforts to provide more visibility into key growth areas of the business, we will share a new metric demonstrating our progress with GoDaddy Payments. GPV represents the dollar amount of payments processed on the GoDaddy payments platform. With Q4 as the first quarter with commerce fully launched on every surface in the U.S., GPV has already grown to an impressive $760 million. Core platform revenue decreased 2% to $707 million in the fourth quarter, primarily due to the tough compare to the year-ago quarter when aftermarket benefited from some larger than average transactions we have discussed previously as well as a modest decrease in our hosting business. As previously mentioned, the hosting business has out-sized exposure to uneven demand in Europe as well as FX pressure. ARR for core platform grew 1% to $2.3 billion. Q4 bookings grew to $1.1 billion, flat year-over-year and growing 2% on a constant currency basis. Applications and Commerce bookings grew 7% on strength of Websites + Marketing, email attach and hardware and software sales. Core Platform bookings decreased 3% year-over-year on tough aftermarket compares noted earlier and due to softness in the broader hosting business. Gross margin was down slightly for the quarter, primarily due to product mix. Payments revenue will put some pressure on gross margins as this revenue stream gets larger in the future. However, there are relatively low incremental operating costs once those customers are acquired and set up on GoDaddy Payments, so we expect payments to be highly accretive to Normalized EBITDA as we scale. Normalized EBITDA in Q4 grew 5% to $266 million, representing a 26% margin and an expansion of 70 basis points in the quarter. Continued discipline in spending allowed us to increase our margins at a rate higher than our bookings. GoDaddy\u2019s high brand awareness and the effectiveness of our in-house bidding algorithm allowed us to drive efficiencies in marketing spend. We also continued to drive leverage in customer care. Unlevered free cash flow grew 17% to $238 million, while free cash flow grew 16% to $202 million delivering $1.29 free cash flow per share in the quarter, a 25% increase over last year\u2019s Q4 free cash flow per share. Turning to the balance sheet, we exited the year with $774 million in cash and total liquidity of $1.8 billion. Net debt landed at $3.1 billion, below 3 times net leverage on a trailing 12-month basis, and near the midpoint of our targeted range of 2 to 4 times. On our share repurchase efforts, we\u2019ve returned $1.3 billion of cash to shareholders under the current authorization. From January 1, 2022 through February 1, 2023, we repurchased 17.2 million shares, which has reduced our fully diluted share count by approximately 10% since the beginning of 2022, on target for the 15% to 20% net reduction for the 3-year period. On customers, over recent years, the way we generate revenue has evolved through our expanded offerings to our customers, resellers and partners. We will continue to use metrics like ARR, GMV and GPV to show the health of our business and the progress towards our strategic goals as discussed at Investor Day. As a result of the way our relationship with customers is evolving, we have updated the way we measure and report our total customers. In addition to paid subscriptions at the end of the period, we will now include accounts with paid transactions in the trailing 12 months and exclude accounts that have converted to free versions of our software. These changes do not meaningfully affect the historical customer growth or retention trends previously disclosed. We believe the updated definition more accurately reflects the dynamic customer lifecycle and provides more detail around the overall strength of our historical cohorts with a continued focus on long-term customers with a higher propensity to spend. Under the new definition, in 2022 ARPU increased to $197 compared to $187 and $170 in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Retention rates remained consistent at 85% and customer count increased to 20.9 million in 2022 compared to 20.7 and 20.1 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Moving on to our outlook for Q1 and for full year 2023, let us start by covering several notable events. In January, we signed a partnership agreement with FIS Worldpay to be a strategic reseller of our OmniCommerce solutions for U.S.-based small business customers and bank partners. This arrangement is expected to drive growth in the second half of the year and will contribute to our commerce strategy through increased reach of our OmniCommerce offerings and website attachment. We are excited about the launch of this partnership in 2023 and the momentum this gives our Application and Commerce segment going into 2024 and beyond. On restructuring, we took certain actions necessary to align our structure with the current economic environment and position ourselves for future growth. This will result in annualized savings of approximately $100 million through a combination of a reduction in workforce, reduced spending, and integration of certain European brands and businesses within our Core Platform segment. This will also result in a modest headwind to core platform revenue of 100 basis points in 2023 as we sunset certain brands. We expect estimated restructuring and other related exit charges of $55 million to $65 million with most of the charges to be recognized in the first half of 2023. In Q1 2023, we are targeting total revenue of $1.03 billion to $1.05 billion. This represents 4% growth at the midpoint of the range and includes approximately 2 points of FX headwind from prior year bookings. Excluding this, the midpoint of our guidance would imply approximately 6 points of growth. We expect Normalized EBITDA margin during Q1 to be in the range of 24% to 25%. For the full year, we expect total revenue to be within a range of $4.25 billion to $4.325 billion, representing growth of 5% at the midpoint of the range. This outlook is inclusive of approximately 2 points of headwind from FX from prior year bookings and the anticipated brand integrations mentioned above. In the Application and Commerce segment, we are projecting revenue growth of 8% to 10%. In Core Platform, we are projecting revenue growth in the range of 2% to 4%. Normalized EBITDA during the year is expected to continue to grow, with a targeted margin of approximately 26%. As a reminder, as we scale our commerce offerings, gross margin will be pressured and is expected to be in the low- to mid-60s range. As we gain operational efficiency in commerce, this is expected to drive incremental Normalized EBITDA margins. As we have shared previously, we have multiple levers within our control to drive margins, while we continue to invest in the business. This allows us to strike a balance and continue growing revenue, while achieving operating leverage down the income statement to drive sustainable shareholder value over the cycle. You have seen our recent record of accomplishment of delivering against our margin targets, and we are confident in executing on our profitability goals this year regardless of where we land within our revenue guidance range. For the full year of 2023, we are targeting free cash flow of greater than $1 billion and unlevered free cash flow of greater than $1.2 billion. We remain on target to deliver free cash flow per share of more than $7 and are committed to returning capital to the shareholders under the remaining buyback authorized by the Board in 2022. As stated in the past, our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged and we will continue to evaluate our use-of-cash options on a quarterly basis. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $50 million, income tax payments of approximately $30 million and cash interest payments of approximately $170 million. Moving forward, we will share ARR, GMV, ARPU and customer count quarterly. We will share GPV and retention rate annually. Taken together, these metrics provide a more comprehensive view of GoDaddy\u2019s expansive business over time and provide a view into revenue growth and profitability as we continue to expand customer lifetime value. These metrics may fluctuate based on acquisitions, integrations, divestitures and seasonality. That said, we are in an advantaged position given our ability to provide an ever-growing suite of solutions to a large, embedded customer base. In summary, we are proud of our strong and resilient business model, where we are mission critical to our customers. We are confident in our ability to deliver the profitability and cash flow we outlined at Investor Day, and feel the strategic steps taken this quarter will serve as tailwinds for accelerating our pace of revenue growth going forward into 2024 and beyond. Our predictable model provides us the visibility to make prudent business decisions and allows us to remain resolute in operating the business to grow long-term value for our shareholders. With that, I\u2019ll hand over to Christie Masoner, who will be leading the Q&A. A - Christie Masoner : Thanks, Mark. Sorry about the technical difficulties in the middle of the call, our prepared remarks are posted to investors.godaddy.net for reference. As a reminder, if you\u2019d like to ask a question, please use the raise hand feature on the bottom center of the webinar screen to be added to the queue. Our first question comes from the line of Aaron Kessler from Raymond James. Aaron, please go ahead. Aaron Kessler : Thank you, and congrats on the year. Maybe just first on the revenue growth, can you just provide a little bit more details how are you thinking about 2023 revenue growth maybe between customer growth and pricing? And does guidance include any maybe price increases, or just your general thoughts on ability to raise pricing in the future as well? Mark McCaffrey : Thanks, Aaron, and thanks for the question. When we look at 2023, we\u2019re looking at a few things that are within our growth rate. One, we\u2019re going to have some headwinds related to the FX in our bookings in 2022 rolling through the first part of the year, and therefore impacting our overall growth. Second to that, we have integrations we\u2019re taking into effect. And we\u2019ve put some headwinds related to those into our numbers. I think when you look at us overall and take into account those, you\u2019re looking at around a 6% annualized growth rate before that, when it comes to pricing always nuanced for us, we have a broad set of products across our customer base, and what we continue to look at opportunities to price within the market, where we can take more \u2013 we need to take the price, and we continue to look for opportunities to take market share where we can. And, obviously, there\u2019s a lot of things going on coming into 2023, we\u2019ve assumed that some of the macroeconomic environment that we\u2019ve seen in the second half of 2022 persists throughout the year. And, we think we\u2019ll have some acceleration related to some things that we\u2019ve talked about before around commerce. And, of course, we\u2019re excited about the new Worldpay partnership that we signed recently. Aman Bhutani : That\u2019s right. And maybe I\u2019ll just add that all of those factors are included in the guide, as Mark would normally say. And we take those actions, especially pricing into account, when we do the guide. Aaron Kessler : Great. Thank you. Aman Bhutani : Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau from William Blair. Matt, please go ahead. Matthew Pfau : Great. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to just expand on those macro comments a little bit. So if we look at your commentary, it seems like retention rates have held steady. So on the macro side, is it just more in terms of you\u2019re seeing lower demand, and why might that be? And then when we look at those customer addition numbers you gave, how should we think about the net additions for 2022 in terms of rolling that forward? And what should be a reasonable net customer attrition expectation? Aman Bhutani : Yeah, Matt, I can start with that, and maybe Mark can cover a couple of the items just to step through all those items. Overall, when we look at 2022 retention rates continued to be strong. We talked about 85% plus retention rates for our customers, and we\u2019re very happy with those. What we have talked about through the year was that our customers did see some headwinds. So we did see a little bit of pressure on that number. We also talked a little bit about the gross adds being slightly weaker on the \u2013 I think, in the last call. It\u2019s a combination of those factors that really impact the net adds for 2022. Looking into 2023, I don\u2019t know, Mark, if you want to touch on just, we don\u2019t guide to net adds, particularly, but we\u2019re generally assuming the same demand patterns going from 2022 to 2023. And we\u2019re continuing to expect the same strong retention rates for the company, because we\u2019re showing up every day delivering the great products and the great service. So we continue to expect those to continue. Mark McCaffrey : Yeah. We continue to focus on customers with a greater propensity to spend with us and that will be our focus. And as we noted in our stated remarks, our definition of a customer is changing and we\u2019re dealing more with resellers. We signed a partnership with Worldpay that we announced. In certain cases now, through those agreements, we\u2019ll have access to their customers, but they will be our customers. So the ongoing definition and nature of net adds will change and become more broad for us going forward. We\u2019re going to continue to focus on ARPU, continue to focus on being a one-stop shop, and we\u2019re going to continue to focus on making sure that we can provide all the benefits to our customers going forward that will drive our growth. Matthew Pfau : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Appreciate it. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Trevor Young from Barclays. Trevor, please go ahead. Trevor Young : Great, thanks. On the decline in Core Platform arrive in the quarter; can you just talk about what areas were maybe stronger or weaker versus your own expectations? Was it greater declines than hosting and security? Or was that aftermarket flowing and converging with core domains? Or is it just the overall softer customer growth, appreciate the comments on the gross add cadence and that sort of thing. And then any color on how fast aftermarket is actually growing, or how large it is as a percent of revenue, just any update there would be appreciated? Mark McCaffrey : Yeah. Perfect. Maybe I\u2019ll start with the drivers within our Core Platform. And consistent with what we talked about coming out of Q3, we are continuing to see pressure on the aftermarket. Overall, it\u2019s still contributing about 6% growth to our revenue today coming out of the year, it is about 10% of our overall revenue. So we\u2019re still seeing progress. They\u2019re just not at the pace that we saw in 2021. And also we talked about in Q3 hosting; we\u2019re seeing impacts around the European market for hosting, especially when you take it outside of the GoDaddy core platform hosting platform. And we continue to see uneven demand and pressure on retention rates in that business. Overall, those are the things that I think have been consistent when we saw Q3 looking at Q4, and we see that going into Q1 of 2023. And, I think, I\u2019m going to have to pause there, because I forgot the second half of the question. Trevor Young : Yeah. You\u2019ve really addressed it with the aftermarket piece, just how large it is. But just to dovetail on what you were answered there, Mark, the brand that\u2019s being sunset. Is that specifically a hosting product, so we should expect that trend to kind of continue perhaps worsen? Aman Bhutani : Yeah, the brand we\u2019re talking about is Media Temple, and it is a big hosting brand for GoDaddy. Trevor Young : Great. Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Clarke Jeffries from Piper Sandler. Clarke, please go ahead. Clarke Jeffries : Hello, thank you for taking the question. Firstly, on the Worldpay partnership encouraging to hear that that arrangement is expected to drive growth in the second half of this year. I was wondering if we get a little bit more of the specifics of the partnership. What does that refill arrangement look like? Will the economics be different for those partnerships, customers, and then any sense on the ARPU opportunity for those customers that would seem like those Worldpay customers might skew a lot higher in terms of size of customer compared to your existing pay? Aman Bhutani : Yeah, of course, it\u2019s too early to talk about ARPU opportunity, or sort of the specifics of how the relationship would develop. But we\u2019re super excited about the partnership given the reach of Worldpay. And you\u2019re absolutely right, the small and medium sized business, that\u2019s the customer Worldpay is sort of on the bigger end of our micro business customers. But we\u2019re ready with the product and putting our products next to Worldpay reach is going to create an exciting new opportunity in the market. We\u2019re looking, it\u2019s a long-term partnership between the two companies, our teams are excited to work together, we\u2019re starting to see some customers in the pilot, and we\u2019re pretty excited about where this can go. Mark McCaffrey : Yeah. And also the launch for 2023 is in the U.S. only. So there\u2019s a lot more opportunity down the road, and we\u2019re very, very excited about it. We have to hit some milestones that the first half of the year leading into the second half. But when you look at our overall commerce platform, and how revenue comes out of our commerce platform. We have hardware and software sales. We have reseller. We have GoDaddy payments, and then we have the attach-related to Websites + Marketing and Managed WordPress. And Worldpay partnership will hit several of those, we\u2019ll start with hardware and software. It\u2019ll have some reseller impact and it\u2019ll also allow us to attach directly to their customers Websites + Marketing and Managed WordPress. So we think the ability to drive not only ARPU as we go into 2024, but our growth rates around commerce are going to be fantastic, given the nature of this relationship. Clarke Jeffries : Perfect. And if I could just ask one follow-up, Create and Grow ARR slight improvement in year-over-year trends and if I look at it from what you disclosed maybe an improvement in sequential trends. At this point, I\u2019m wondering if I could get your view on where we are in the curve of the macro. Does it feel like we\u2019ve leveled out in terms of the customer trends in e-commerce? Any kind of comment there would be helpful? Aman Bhutani : Well, it\u2019s \u2013 do you want to\u2026 Mark McCaffrey : No. Go ahead. Aman Bhutani : Maybe I\u2019ll go first, and you can jump in as well. I think, none of us have the crystal ball, it\u2019s really hard to sort of predict the macro, but then we continue to see sort of uncertainty around it. And, we\u2019re doing our best to look at the data that we have and look at the indicators in the marketplace. And I\u2019m sure everybody else looks at it as well. But we\u2019re trying to run the business and what we see and we\u2019re pretty happy with our results, and we\u2019re focused on the execution and what we control. Mark McCaffrey : Yeah, I gave up trying to be an economist in this environment, that\u2019s the truth. We have a broad business, too. So we see impacts in different areas. And example, we\u2019ve talked about aftermarket, we\u2019ve seen the impact in this environment around our transactions there. But commerce continues to make progress going into 2023, we\u2019re seeing a lot of taking \u2013 talk about the attach-related to Websites + Marketing, when people are coming through the funnel, we\u2019ve continued to see the progress of our existing customer base or 21 million customers converting over to payments. We\u2019re really excited for the first time that we have all the revenue streams in place, and they\u2019re making progress towards our stated objectives, especially as we look at 2024 and beyond. So, the one thing that we continue to evaluate as our business gets impacted in different ways based on different things happening, which gives us protection overall, but something we need to continue to monitor. Clarke Jeffries : Really appreciate it. Thank you very much. Christie Masoner : Our next question is from Ygal Arounian from Citi. Ygal, please go ahead. Ygal Arounian : Hey, good afternoon, guys. So it sounds like you\u2019re still committed to the 15% EBITDA, and then the free cash flow guidance gave, and it sounds like we\u2019re stepping off of the commitment to the revenue growth given the macro business. So first, just thinking about \u2013 or can you help us think about the right way to think through revenue growth and where we should be thinking what you guys are thinking. And then on the OpEx in the $100 million savings, any more color you could share on where typically those are coming from which line items? Mark McCaffrey : Yeah, I\u2019ll start, and Aman you could add. So looking at our investment thesis going back to Investor Day, we talked about the revenue growth, Normalized EBITDA, cash flow per share, share buybacks, were our main components. And in looking at the profitability and the cash flow per share coming into 2022, we started the year in forecasting 23% to 24% for the year. We\u2019re exiting the year 26%, so we\u2019re ahead of target on profitability. We\u2019re delivering cash flow per share greater than the $6, we had targeted at $61.20. So those two, we are really happy with our progress. Things like FX and the macro environment hit our bookings. In that booking, especially in our subscription revenue, takes time to roll out. So we\u2019re seeing headwinds leading into 2023 related to that revenue growth. We also with some of the actions we\u2019re taking or building in some headwind on revenue for the integrated brands that we\u2019ve been talking about. So as time goes on, we think we are well positioned to be a double-digit revenue growth company going forward. But it will take time for our bookings to roll to our revenue to get back to the tailwinds versus the headwinds we\u2019re facing coming into 2023. We feel really good about our ability to meet our other objectives around profitability around cash flow per share. And we stay committed to our share buybacks, so a lot of positive there. But we are controlling what we can control and we\u2019re monitoring what what\u2019s going on in the macro environment. Assuming that, we will see a headwind turn into a tailwind as we go into 2024. Aman Bhutani : I think you covered it all. I think what I might add is that our success GoDaddy is aligned with sort of secular trends around people coming to the internet, people transacting on the internet, people wanting to get their idea out there and be inspired and be an entrepreneur. And that opportunity is huge. And we\u2019re super excited about it and pursuing it over the medium to long term. From my perspective, if the top-line metrics, if those milestones are moving a bit, it doesn\u2019t change our direction, it doesn\u2019t change our strategy, it actually allows us to focus the business and put ourselves in a position where we can grow faster and as the macro improve being a very good position to take share. Ygal Arounian : Great. And then, on the OpEx kind of where that\u2019s coming from specifically for savings? Mark McCaffrey : So a couple of different areas. One, most of the actions were primarily around our Core Platform segment to give some color of the area. And then, some of the areas in line items include, HR recruiting, marketing, I think, we\u2019re the ones that were targeted during this event. And I think those were the primary things within our operating expense. Ygal Arounian : Okay. And then last question on the Worldpay partnership there, it\u2019s really interesting. I think it\u2019s the first major retail partnership you guys have done? Is this a shift in strategy to do more things like this, and that become a bigger part of the customer growth and kind of future growth? Aman Bhutani : Yeah, look, our path is to see GoDaddy terminals in every store, and to see GoDaddy software being used by millions and millions of micro and small businesses, a partnership like Worldpay gives us access to be able to reach a pool of customers faster. So I would say it\u2019s very much aligned to our core strategy. And, yes, as opportunities present themselves to reach our goals or execute that strategy. We\u2019ll look at other opportunities as well. Ygal Arounian : Okay, great. Thanks. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Porter at Morgan Stanley. Elizabeth, please go ahead. Elizabeth Porter : Great. Thank you so much. I just wanted to hit on the restructuring a little bit more. So could you help us understand just the restructuring announcement with the context for your outlook on revenue growth to start to improve from Q4 and Q1 guidance? Is this more about allocation of resources versus an outlook on demand? And then just related, how should we think about reinvestment in the business? Mark McCaffrey : So I\u2019ll start with \u2013 hi, Elizabeth. I\u2019ll start with the Q4 leading into Q1, when we look at our growth and the impact, 2022 had on our bookings coming out of Q4. We needed to right size our operating structure to reflect the bookings growth and the impact that was going to have on revenue growth going into 2023. And that\u2019s how we looked at it controlling what we can control from an operating perspective. And monitoring and assuming that the macroeconomic environment we\u2019re in today will persist throughout the year. When it comes to investment in tech and dev, we primarily looked at core platform, and some of the non-strategic brands around hosting as we started to evaluate where we were going to look at productions versus invest. And the flip side of it is applications and commerce continues to be an area we invest in, commerce continues to be a growth driver for us leaving it to 2024. So when it comes to investment in tech and dev, we continue to push towards that. I always use the commentary, there\u2019s two things you need to have to win in the tech industry going forward, you need innovation, and you need to own the customer relationship, we can continue to focus on both of those continue to innovate. Commerce, again, is one of the areas we continue to look for innovation and growth. And obviously, our customer care relationships have been something that has been strength for us going forward. So those two areas continue to be the areas of investment for us. Elizabeth Porter : Great. And then just on the ARPU, given the change in customer count any context for how ARPU grew in 2021 versus the 10% that you just recorded for 2022. And, how should we think about the level of sustainability any opportunity there is to actually accelerate ARPU into 2023, just as you improve through the attach of commerce and payments? Aman Bhutani : Yeah, we\u2019re absolutely focused on growing ARPU. And, our strategy around bundling more products and something we\u2019ve talked about over many quarters, right, is about bringing new customers and existing customers and exposing them to more and more of our product range. So we\u2019re absolutely looking at opportunities to increase ARPU. And just to touch on your comment over the years, the trends are similar. We\u2019ve had sort of consistent ARPU growth over the years and we\u2019re investing and making the right decisions to continue to see that happen. Mark McCaffrey : Yeah, continued focus on customers with a greater entity to spend in commerce, we think it will be a big opportunity. 85% of our revenue comes from our existing subscription base right now, but as we get more into the transactional nature of the businesses on the one-stop shop, that will create an opportunity for us to continue to increase ARPU. Elizabeth Porter : Great. Thank you so much. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from Evercore ISI. Mark, please go ahead. Mark Mahaney : Thanks. The increased disclosure is a good thing. So, thanks for doing that and doing it quarterly going forward. You talked about marketing launch for payables domain in the U.S., you provide any more color on that? And then any color on the timing for international Payable Domains enablement? Thank you. Aman Bhutani : Yeah, thanks, Mark. The marketing launch starts in about 2 weeks with some PR, and you\u2019ll start to see Payable Domains really show up in a lot of our marketing collateral, including the site today, you can get to Payable Domains in fact, I think I\u2019ve talked about it in the past that just given our large size of domains under management, we had to roll this out. So we could support all different kinds of domains. We\u2019re ready with that in the U.S. Now we\u2019re just going to bring it to the site, bring it into our marketing bring it into our merchandising and promotions, so that every customer new and existing is able to see it, and in this start to connect the dots for them so that they start to understand what a Payable Domain is. In terms of international, obviously, we feel this product is very global, just like a domain name Payable Domain with appealing, because just should work everywhere in the world, but no specific timing on international rollout just yet. Mark Mahaney : Okay. Thank you, Aman. Aman Bhutani : Thank you, Mark. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of [John Bryan] [ph] from Jefferies on behalf of Brent Thill. John, please go ahead. Hey, John, you\u2019re muted. Aman Bhutani : John? Unidentified Analyst : Sorry about that, I guess, now unmuted. Thanks. This is John [ph] on behalf of Brent Thill. The first question on the FIS Worldpay, is there when you think about when that is scaled, what sort of impact they might have on gross margin and operating margin? Mark McCaffrey : Yes. So as we think it\u2019s going to start to have impact in 2023, as we hit certain milestones, now it\u2019ll be relatively small within 2023, but it\u2019ll give us momentum going into 2024. We expect it to be accretive to our margins overall, our operating margins. Again, as we start to scale, and the breadth of the relationship is just not about a transactional, but it\u2019s hardware/software leads to other fees, and then leads to our ability to attach Websites + Marketing and Managed WordPress, that should give us the ability to get operating leverage and improve our operating margins down the road. We\u2019re very excited about this. It\u2019s a very broad relationship. Again, it\u2019s focused on the U.S. right now. But we think the opportunity to go global on it overall is going to be exciting moving forward. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you. And then, we\u2019re about halfway through Q1. I\u2019m wondering, what you see in terms of the environment, in terms of the activity and demand trends? And does it feel like it\u2019s similar to Q4? Are you starting to see any recovery at all with new customer base? Thank you. Aman Bhutani : Yeah, I think, the word that we\u2019ve used in the past continues to work, which is \u2013 we continue to see sort of uncertainty around what\u2019s going to happen. There is no large fluctuation. But even when we look at the geographies, when we look at certain products that we sell, we do see trends that are different from what we\u2019ve seen in the long-term. And, right now, in any one geography, a trend can change very, very quickly. But, overall, I\u2019d say over the last couple of quarters were \u2013 looking into Q1, we\u2019re seeing some core stability, which is ultimately a good thing. Mark McCaffrey : Yeah, it\u2019s \u2013 we still think that the large opportunity is out there for us to go gather, obviously, we\u2019re assuming the macro environment stays muted a bit as we go into 2023. And, again, coming back to one of my previous answers, different parts of our business are impacted differently in this environment, and we continue to see that and monitor that. We\u2019ve talked about aftermarket, we\u2019ve continued to see \u2013 not seeing the large transactions related to aftermarket. So that is something that has continued into 2023. On the other hand, we see greater attach around commerce, and we\u2019re seeing the trend continue to grow throughout the year. So we\u2019re excited about things going in to the rest of the year. However, we\u2019re acknowledging that some of these may take some time to develop as we reset our bookings into revenue or under subscription business. Thank you. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes to the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe Research. Deepak, please go ahead. Deepak Mathivanan : Hey, guys, thanks for taking the questions. And I just want to ask about the pricing expectations for 2023. There\u2019s a lot of pricing tweaks happening in the market currently given the sustained inflation. Can you talk about philosophy \u2013 your philosophy in 2023 whether you see potential to raise prices on any products either on the domain side or on other areas? And then, second question, are you seeing any market share shifts in your core products in domains, or in Websites + Marketing currently? Aman Bhutani : Yeah. On pricing, Deepak, we continue to have a nuanced approach. As I\u2019ve talked about before, we price our products based on the customer population we serve based on the geography, there is also specific bundling and channel dynamics, your pricing as well. We also maintain that we provide services and products to our customers, where the value we provide is much higher than the price that we have. So we do continue to feel that there\u2019s pricing opportunity. But we\u2019ll continue to be nuanced about it, because we have added a lot of capabilities over the last year for us to be flexible around how we price and how we market and how we sort of move dollars around within between geos and channels to allow us to get the best return on ad spend. So, yes, you\u2019ll see some pricing actions from us, which are all in the guide like Mark says, but you\u2019ll also see some sort of \u2013 as you see some increases, you\u2019ll also see in some markets, some decreases, because our testing clearly shows that there\u2019s room to take share there. And that\u2019s sort of our approach to market share overall as well. We\u2019re constantly now testing these things. And when we see an opportunity, we\u2019re going to lean in and take market share, and we\u2019re able to move marketing dollars around quickly much faster, I would say, than we were in the past. So we will lean in there and take market share. And in other markets where we see opportunity to take price, we will take price. Deepak Mathivanan : Got it. And then, if I can just ask one quick follow-up, and I apologize if this was asked already. Can you unpack the 2023 revenue guidance a little bit, maybe specifically in terms of how much you expect contribution from things like payments, and some of these other incremental growth areas? Mark McCaffrey : Yeah. We haven\u2019t gotten into the breakdown of each of the contributing areas we\u2019re looking at in our revenue guidance right now is continued growth in ARR around our subscription businesses. Again, a focus on applications and commerce is obviously our higher growing area right now versus our core platform, which we\u2019ve talked about some of the pressures we\u2019ve seen around hosting and aftermarket. We continue to be excited about commerce, we haven\u2019t broken down the dollars between all of that, but we look at that as a contributor. And remember, we we\u2019re looking at some of the \u2013 in our subscription business, what I would say, a rollover effect of the FX that will be a headwind for our revenue in the first part of the year. But assuming macro condition stabilizes should become a tailwind as we get to the back half of the year, as well as looking out into 2024. So a lot of moving parts there, we haven\u2019t gotten into this product versus this product type of things. We\u2019re extremely excited about the progress of commerce that\u2019s the one thing we continue to call out. We\u2019re excited about the contribution of Worldpay, and the momentum it gives us going into 2024, again, those around our applications in commerce business. And we continue to see our ability to be that one-stop shop for our customers and be able to long-term opportunity that we continue to pursue. Christie Masoner : Great. Thank you. I\u2019ll now hand the call over to Aman for some final remarks. Aman Bhutani : Thank you, Christie, and thank you all for joining us. As always I\u2019d like to thank all GoDaddy employees for another good quarter, and sort of the focused energy to continue to drive the business and grow the business. We\u2019ll see you next quarter.",

With that, I'm pleased to introduce Aman. Aman Bhutani : Thank you, Christie. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. GoDaddy's mission is to empower entrepreneurs and make opportunity more inclusive for all. We learn from our customers every day and they are a resilient group and they value what GoDaddy brings to them. While many worry about a recession, our venture forward service found that our customers are noticeably more optimistic today about the future of their business than they were six months ago. One customer we showcased in the past is the Furlough Cheesecake founded by two sisters impacted by a government furlough. In a recent interview, one of them commented, with partners like GoDaddy we can manage our business from anywhere. GoDaddy helped us launch our business quickly from idea to up and running in one week because they had the tools in place. GoDaddy's unique combination of seamless intuitive technology and best-in-class human and digital guidance creates the ease of use that our customers want and need so they can focus on their business. This combination continues to differentiate us in the marketplace, helping us drive profitable growth and superb cash flow. We serve 21 million customers that have a high retention rate of 85%. In Q1, we drove double-digit growth of 12% in our Applications and Commerce segment supported by 10% ARR growth in our Create and Grow products. Additionally, we surpassed $1 billion in annualized GPV for GoDaddy payments. One area we continue to watch carefully is our aftermarket business. We faced tough compares last quarter and a continued unevenness in flow of large deals that we believe is impacted by broader macro headwinds. Overall, we are pleased with our Q1 results and encouraged by the positive momentum over the quarter, especially in our Subscription and Commerce businesses. Our strategic priorities remain consistent and our teams continue to launch experiments and new experiences at a fast pace. As always, I will review each of our priorities. For our first priority, driving Commerce through presence, we are happy to share that we gained exciting traction in our Commerce offerings. We had our best quarter yet, attracting sellers, more than we anticipated and rapidly crossed over the $1 billion of annualized GPV. The largest opportunity for us remains our existing base, of 21 million customers and the many sellers that are already a part of it. The efficient motion of selling into our existing customer base, was the primary contributor to our GPV growth. And hence, it remains our focus as we work to scale this sales team. Adopting our commerce product, paves the way for customers to deepen the relationship with us, which results in higher retention and increased lifetime value. Last month, we also launched Apple's contactless Tap to Pay technology, within our GoDaddy app. As you know, Tap to Pay allows our customers to accept all types of contactless in-person payments, with only an iPhone just by tapping their credit card, mobile wallet or watch. We worked directly with Apple, to integrate this technology natively, creating a seamless, best-in-class, low-friction sign of experience for our app customers. We also made several other improvements to make websites plus marketing a more robust solution, for sellers including improved pay buttons, and new reports for merchants to help them prepare their taxes and understand their fees and payouts. Our teams are also excited about, how generative AI can add ease of use for customers, by auto populating content for them and helping them create natural language, e-mails, chat and text messages, they engage with their customers. AI-powered tools are showing up across multiple experiences at GoDaddy. For example, we built instant video features in our Studios app and use cases like auto generating product descriptions, are coming soon. As always, we are focused on both technology tools and guidance for our customers. As our customers start exploring generative AI, we want to help them by launching a growing area of resources so our small business owners can begin harnessing, its power to save time and grow their sales. For example, we now provide an essential small business guide [indiscernible] library. We are also working to bring these capabilities together, in a manner that even the smallest businesses can benefit from instantaneously accessing vast amounts of data and transforming it into something meaningful for their business. Websites + Marketing continues to be rated, as the highest-performing website builder according to Google Core, Web vitals and it is taking share in the marketplace. The team continues to focus on making it easy for customers, to build high-performance websites quickly. On our second priority, delivering for GoDaddy Pro. Our goal is to make them better serve their clients and grow their businesses. GoDaddy Pro\u2019s value, platform capabilities like performance, availability and security, but also automation, support, ease of use and value-added offers. Our new managed WooCommerce store offering replaced our old managed WordPress Commerce offering, over the last few weeks. With this new product in place, we are bringing many more capabilities to the table and we'll be able to test into higher-priced SKUs. On our Hosting business, our focus is around stabilization and simplification. As discussed previously, we are on course to integrate brands more deeply which includes retiring the Media Temple brand with the final migration of customers to the GoDaddy full stack. In April, we also signed an agreement to exit a couple of our smaller European brands. Our goal remains to provide customers with a higher level of service at a lower cost to serve while sharpening our focus. On our third priority innovation in domains. We have continued to broaden our bundling offers for new and existing customers, while our initial focus was around bundling e-mail, we have increased experimentation velocity and are doing much more here. We are improving the onboarding flow for customers with the target of higher attach and encouraged by the results we have seen. This matters because we know that customers who activate and attach more products have higher retention rates. And we continue to be excited about payable domains and have two clear insights since our launch : first customers who adopt this product are demonstrating their satisfaction by quickly doing a significant number of transactions through the default tailing we provide. Our initial efforts to drive more traffic to this product resulted in impressive early GPV. Second, we noticed that existing customers are more ready to use this product compared to potential customers who are new to purchasing a domain. We are currently focused on creating more opportunities for both existing and new domain customers to discover and utilize payable domains. Although there is still work to be done, we strongly believe in the enormous potential of this offering. On the aftermarket, you will remember our List for Sale feature that allows GoDaddy customers to list their domain in the aftermarket. This quarter we extended this capability to our registrar partners, opening a channel to bring more inventory to the aftermarket. We've also added new features to the customer experience for brokered aftermarket transactions. We built a new lead center giving real-time status updates to the leads being pursued on behalf of domain sellers so they can have more visibility into progress on their transactions. Our aftermarket business continues to innovate and create value for our customers and all players in the industry. At GoDaddy, we are eager to help small businesses thrive. This fuels us to create better products that deliver greater value for our customers which drives our attractive financial model that then translates into sustained customer and shareholder value. This is the simple approach of how we work to grow GoDaddy and differentiate our offerings. We are proud of the consistency of our strong execution and our strategy. We have a great business with a loyal and growing customer base that continues to spend more time. With us through our strong competitive advantages and attractive financial profile GoDaddy is well positioned to continue to grow and deliver for all stakeholders in meaningful ways. With that here's Mark. Mark McCaffrey : Thanks, Aman. Before getting into the detailed results, I wanted to summarize a few key points. First, we are making progress towards returning to double-digit growth while executing our three year plan to expand our operating margins and deliver on our free cash flow per share targets; second, we are delivering on our applications and Commerce segment growth through increases in new customers and the conversion of our existing customers to our payments platform in the US.; lastly, we are on target to complete our restructuring action in the second quarter, driving better operating leverage in our core platform segment and improving our overall operating margin in the second half of the year. With that, Applications & Commerce revenue grew to $338 million up 12%, exceeding our guide of 8% to 10%. Additionally, the normalized EBITDA margin for Applications & Commerce was 39%. Taken together, this highlights the impressive performance we are driving in this business which delivered ARR for Create and Grow of $450 million, up 10% and over $1 billion of GPV. This segment is our largest opportunity to drive growth through the attachment of our Create and Grow products, Commerce platform and productivity solutions for both new and existing customers. ARR for Applications & Commerce grew 9% to more than $1.3 billion. Annualized GMV, across the GoDaddy ecosystem grew 18% to approximately $28 billion. Our core platform segment which includes Domains, Hosting and Security continues to serve as an important on-ramp to our overall business. Core Platform revenue was $698 million with an ARR of $2.2 billion and a strong normalized EBITDA margin of 27%. Core Platform revenue was supported by a 5% growth in domains from a combination of new customer adds, attach and price increases on renewals. This was offset by tough compares for our aftermarket business as well as the continued uneven flow of large transactions. Additionally, there are modest impacts to our hosting revenue and customer count from migration of non-core hosting platforms being sunset. Total revenue, grew to $1.04 billion up 3% on a reported basis and 5% on a constant currency basis, reflecting a sequential lift from the Q4 growth rate. Within total revenue, international revenue grew 3% on a reported basis and 7% on a constant currency basis. Q1 bookings grew faster than revenue at a rate of 4% on a reported basis and 5% on a constant currency basis, totaling $1.2 billion. Bookings growth on our subscription products outpaced the related revenue growth by approximately 100 basis points. Our durable model continues to generate cash flow through our strong customer relationships and cohort performance, highlighted by our customer retention rate of 85%. We build on this strength through intentionally focusing our marketing on attracting high-intent customers that stay with GoDaddy and spend more. This quarter, we added 100,000 net new high-quality customers, despite headwinds from our migration efforts noted above. Our ARPU grew 4% to $197 from $190 last year. Normalized EBITDA grew 11% to $250 million with a margin of 24%, representing approximately 160 basis points expansion. We expect to continue to drive operating leverage through strong execution and our restructuring efforts. Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter totaled $304 million, growing 6% driven by strong profitability, while free cash flow remained flat at $259 million, despite an increase in our cash interest expense due to the refinancing of our term debt in Q4 2022. Free cash flow per share rose to $6.19 on a trailing 12-month basis versus the prior year's cash flow per share of $5.25, an 18% increase driven by execution, operating leverage and share repurchases. Additionally, in Q1 we completed $114 million of share buybacks, repurchasing 1.6 million shares. This brings the cumulative share repurchase under our $3 billion authorization to $1.4 billion and 18.4 million shares reducing shares outstanding since inception by 11%. We remain on target for our commitment to reduce our fully diluted shares outstanding by 15% to 20% over the three-year period. On the balance sheet we finished Q1 with $892 million in cash and total liquidity of $1.9 billion. Net debt stands at $3 billion with 2.7 times net leverage within our targeted range of two to four times. Lastly as noted above we signed an agreement to divest certain non-core hosting assets which is expected to close by Q3. Our restructuring charge of $50 million in the quarter included $21 million of a non-cash impairment charge for these assets. Moving on to our outlook. We are targeting Q2 total revenue in the range of $1.045 billion to $1.065 billion, representing growth of 4% at the midpoint. With the current momentum, we expect to exit the year at approximately 7% top line growth with a normalized EBITDA of 28%. We expect applications and Commerce segment growth to be between 8% and 10% for both Q2 and the full year. For core platform, we expect revenue growth 1% to 3% in Q2 and accelerate in the back half of the year to deliver between 2% and 4% for the full year. Q2 normalized EBITDA margin is expected to improve to approximately 25% with continued acceleration over the back half of the year to deliver full year normalized EBITDA margin of approximately 26%, showing improved operating leverage from the actions previously discussed. I would like to spend a moment bridging our expected 2023 revenue growth to what we believe our strategy and model can produce going forward. Our current guide for the full year is 5% revenue growth at the midpoint. As a reminder, this year's revenue growth rate includes approximately two points of FX pressure from last year's bookings and is also impacted by difficult compares in our aftermarket business and the divestiture of certain non-core revenue-generating assets. Looking ahead to next year and beyond, absent those negative impacts and with the momentum we are driving through the strategic initiatives Aman spoke about earlier including ARPU expansion, even with the continuation of the current macro environment there is a path to returning to double-digit top line growth, while remaining committed to delivering our margin expansion and free cash flow targets. We remain disciplined in how and where we spend with a focus on controlling our costs, optimize our marketing spend, monitoring headcount and investing in innovation so that we can strike the right balance between capturing attractive opportunities with delivering value to our shareholders always with an eye towards balanced long-term growth and profitability. In closing, we have strong confidence in our ability to execute and accelerate our growth. We believe our competitive position and strategic advantages, our diverse product offerings, our strong balance sheet and the consistent and predictable cash flow we generate will position GoDaddy as a leader amongst its peers. Our 21 million customers create the foundation for our resiliency. We remain focused on execution against our strategic priorities responsibly managing our business and building deeper customer relationships as we partner alongside entrepreneurs on their journey. With that we will have Christie Masoner from our Investor Relations team open up the call for questions. A - Christie Masoner : Thanks, Mark. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Matt Pfau from William Blair. Matt, please go ahead. Matt Pfau : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. First wanted to understand the potential acceleration next year a little bit better. So if we look at the business absent those three headwinds that you cited do we need an acceleration in that business in order to get to double-digits, or is just a normalization of those three headwinds sort of enough to get us there? Mark McCaffrey : Thanks Matt. I'll handle the first part of that and it sounds like you have a second question too. So on the bridge we do see I would say easier comps on things like aftermarket coming into the second half of the year which will start to serve as a tailwind. So normalizing the core platform segment growth obviously is in the cards as it turns around into easy year compares in that end of it. Domains is growing at a good pace. And obviously we're taking some actions on hosting which will act as a headwind in the back half of the year but turn into a tailwind as well next year. So a lot of positive momentum. Obviously applications and commerce continues to be the higher growing segment for us. We're seeing a lot of traction on commerce. And we've talked about the four pillars there and then being in the market and we're really happy with the performance of those. So the ability to bridge to what we see as a path to that double-digit growth we've talked about we think starts to take that momentum in 2024. Aman Bhutani : Yes. And maybe I'll just add Mark, Matt that we see of course the headwinds away but we also have good momentum in the business. Mark already mentioned the growth in AMC, but also the domains business has done well and demand has been better and improving. So we're very sort of encouraged by the momentum and that's what we're really talking about. Matt Pfau : Great. And then just wanted to ask a follow-up on gross margins. It dipped sequentially in the quarter. I'm guessing that's probably due to payments. So is that true? And how should we think about that trend throughout the year as presumably payments continues to gain traction? Mark McCaffrey : Yes. No doubt Matt that we've talked about that product mix will impact our gross margin. And we're focusing on operating margin as we run the business and expansion of that. But as we get into more of the transactional businesses we can continue to see pressure on the gross margin, but be in that 60 -- low 60s to mid-60s range. As it scales it becomes more accretive. Obviously we get the leverage on the operating margin and it'll help us deliver on our normalized EBITDA. Matt Pfau : Great. Thanks. Appreciate it. Mark McCaffrey : Thanks, Matt. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Trevor Young from Barclays. Trevor, please go ahead. Trevor Young : Great. Thanks. Just first one Mark. On the 1Q segment results core platform a bit below guide and A&C a bit ahead, on either of these, could you maybe speak to which areas drove relative under or outperformance specific versus your expectations? And then, on repurchases in the quarter, a bit below run rate over the prior three quarters and a bit below what you'd expect given the $1 billion guide. Realized capital allocation strategy was reiterated here, but just wondering if there was something that gave you pause on those repurchases such as macro or just a conscious effort to kind of bolster cash on hand a bit? Any color there would be appreciated. Mark McCaffrey : Yes. Thanks, Trevor. On core platform, aftermarket and the larger transactions continues to be the area that is uneven for us and becoming difficult to predict. We saw some strength as we were exiting the quarter, but it continues to be uneven and that pretty much drove our underperformance. So a moderate impact from some of the actions we were taking on integrating the non-core hosting platforms, but I would say aftermarket was probably the area of putting us below the original range. On application and commerce, the AGV is ahead of what we -- at a great rate. We're seeing a lot of conversion of our existing customer base which is driving the GPV including new customers signing on. So we're really pleased with the momentum there. Really pleased with the attach we're getting around the websites related to our commerce SKUs. So all that has got great momentum in the quarter. We also saw the benefit of the stickiness of -- as our customers and the applications with commerce are adding more than one product, the retention rates are improving. We've always seen that trend and now we're seeing it more in Q1 with commerce. And with that, we're issuing less refunds and that helped us in the quarter as well that we didn't have to. We're seeing that stickiness start to take place. So we're seeing between the two segments, I would say, as we're integrating the core hosting assets, we are seeing some headwinds around retention of, what I would say, customers with more in the area of one product, but we are seeing a pickup in A&C of the customers with multiple products and multiple services, which is helping us. On capital allocation -- sorry, I almost forgot there was two parts to that. Nothing to call out. We are ahead of schedule at the end of the year. We came into the year with the $1 billion target that hasn't changed. There hasn't been any changes to our capital allocation strategy. And I would still put in there a target of $1 billion for the year. Trevor Young : Great. Thanks, Mark. Mark McCaffrey : Thanks, Trevor. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of John Byun from Jefferies on for Brent Thill. John, please go ahead. Aman Bhutani : John? Christie Masoner : Hi, John. You might be -- I think you\u2019re still muted. John Byun : Okay. I think it was double muted. Thank you very much. So good sequential improvement in GPV from Q4 from $760 million to $1 billion. Wondering, in terms of the driver, was there anything more besides I guess the existing base converting pretty well? And for existing customers, would those be switching from other payment solutions? And if so, how do you convince them to do so other than for pricing? Aman Bhutani : Yes, John thanks for that question. Mark has talked about the pillars of revenue for Commerce. And we actually saw goodness across all of them. But selling into our existing base of customers was the largest driver of this acceleration and growth and we continue to be very excited about it. In terms of how that sales cycle works, our customers have a fantastic relationship with GoDaddy. And we're bringing not just sort of the surprise and delight element of hey you have this relationship with GoDaddy and we have more to offer, we also have great pricing for them. So, when you put together the relationship all the basket of sort of one-stop shop and the pricing that leads to them switching over from other folks. And we -- this is -- of course, we're excited about payable domains and that did its part and resellers did its part. And everyone -- every piece helped, but the prime focus for us is selling into our base. We're seeing goodness there. We're going to keep attacking that. And from what we can see it seems to be a bit of a unique competitive advantage for GoDaddy because of the relationships we have. So, we absolutely are continuing on path on that. John Byun : Great. Thank you. And maybe one follow-up. On the GMV it was flat quarter-to-quarter. I don't know if there was how that was versus your expectation whether you expected any seasonality or just increase from continued adoption? Aman Bhutani : Yes. GMV as a whole if you remember is the broader sort of set of customers we have also inherited from Poynt and it tends to follow seasonality of the business Q4 versus Q1 and nothing new to sort of report that. John Byun : Thank you. Aman Bhutani : Thanks John. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Clarke Jeffries from Piper Sandler. Clark please go ahead. Clarke Jeffries : Hello, thanks for taking the question. First one I think it's for Mark I was hoping you could maybe give us some color on that exit rate of 28% EBITDA margins. How we might be able to think about that between the two segments kind of footing the disclosures you gave on A&C core platform and overhead? Mark McCaffrey : Yes. Thanks Clarke. So, yes 28%. And we talked about the actions we're taking in the first half that will help benefit as we get through the second half of the year and obviously exit the year at a strong run rate there of 7% and 28% of normalized EBITDA margins. A good way to look at it is as we're going through the core platform actions that we've taken around the restructuring and the integration of those platforms into the GoDaddy technology stack. There is going to be some pressure on our retention rates. And we're seeing customers that don't have a higher propensity to spend with us are making that decision as we're doing the transfer over to the GoDaddy stack. On the flip side, the -- being on the GoDaddy stack and having applications and commerce -- and Commerce and our ability for our care guys to engage our customers at a better level is really showing that we're getting more customers signing on to more than one product right now, which again pushes our retention rates higher, pushes our ARPU higher. We're seeing a lot of benefit of that. And A&C comes at a higher margin. So, we're in essence gaining more customers at the higher margin level while we're seeing pressure on the core platform. Those are the lower margin or lower calorie customers I would say. And therefore we're seeing the benefit of the mix start to improve and help us get momentum into the future years into 2024. So, hopefully, that helps kind of how we're looking at it. Aman Bhutani : Yes. And maybe just very quickly Clarke if I can add. If you look at items like marketing spend, obviously, I've talked about it a lot over the last couple of years, but we continue to sort of make our ability to measure return on ad spend better and better globally. And what we're seeing is good gross ads good demand coming to the site and the lowest marketing spend sort of as a percentage of revenue that we've had in a while. So obviously, that continues to help us as well apart from sort of the actions that Mark talked about which are more on the people side. Clarke Jeffries : Perfect. And then just one follow-up. I know you've mentioned a couple of times the aftermarket. I just kind of want to be clear on compared to the guide for core platform is where the result came in compared to the guide maybe either at the midpoint or the low point completely describable by aftermarket, or were there any other factors maybe accelerated movement in the hosting segment that might have also been a contributor there? Helping to clarify that would be great. Mark McCaffrey : Yeah. You just called it. I think the primary driver was aftermarket and the continued absence of the large transactions. Just as a reminder, we don't set the prices in the aftermarket. That's a buyer and seller agreement and we kind of facilitate the transaction between two. So we're still seeing that disconnect in the market related to the buyer and seller agreeing which shows up in the larger transactions. So it's primarily the cause of the core platform missing the guide. There is a little bit on the hosting no doubt. I don't want to say it's 100% because there is some as we are migrating some of the noncore assets into the GoDaddy technology stack we have seen some pressure there. But I would say aftermarket was primary. Clarke Jeffries : Perfect. Thank you very much. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Kessler from Raymond James. Aaron, please go ahead. Aaron Kessler : Great. Thank you. A couple of questions. Maybe just first on the macro, I mean outside of aftermarket can you just maybe talk to the top of the funnel traffic you're seeing kind of gross sub additions? And then just how should we think maybe about the ARPU outlook for 2023? Should we think about it similar to Q1? And just maybe talk about the adoption of higher ASP solutions that you're seeing as well? Thank you. Amanpal Bhutani : Yeah. Thanks Aaron. Maybe I'll just take the top of the funnel and Mark if you want to touch on ARPU. So like I started to say earlier top of the funnel I think we see good demand year-over-year. We see good gross adds and we're pretty happy with what we're seeing and as we had talked about last quarter as well a bit the momentum seemed to improve through the quarter. So our customers by just nature tend to be resilient and tend to be a creative group. So and we serve them like I talked about as well all, but it does seem to be showing up in the numbers to a good extent as well. So we remain optimistic about the rest of the year. And of course we'll keep you updated on it with Mark on ARPU. Mark McCaffrey : Yeah. And I'll start with we don't guide towards ARPU, but looking at the outlook for the year when we think about our goal to attract customers with a higher intent to spend with us our goal is to raise that ARPU number. What we're seeing around the commerce is obviously giving us that momentum that we believe we'll be able to continue to drive that. Q4 to Q1 is a normal pattern for us. I know we haven't gone into quarterly disclosures of ARPU in a while, but based on our billing cycles and bookings happening earlier in the process and in the year that revenue from the bookings will flow through to our ARPU as it rolls out in our subscription business. So it will be a natural benefit that we will start to see. So we're excited about attracting more customers with higher intent. We're seeing that especially in the commerce area, which showed up in Q1. The momentum there has been really, really good and we continue to be driving towards adding that ARPU as we go throughout the year. Aman Bhutani : And we can \u2013 those two thoughts together with bookings growing faster than revenue both those pieces basically come together. Aaron Kessler : Great. Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Porter from Morgan Stanley. Elizabeth, please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Great. [indiscernible] on the line from Elizabeth's team. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask on the regional banking crisis. We've seen in some of the senior loan officer surveys that are pointing to tougher requirements to get loans. How important is this financing channel for your target customer base? Are you seeing any impact today? And what is incorporated into your outlook? Aman Bhutani : I think from two views, one from our customer's view I think the challenges in the financial banking crisis have not had a significant impact for our customers. I would remind you that many of our customers are micro businesses and they don't even access to banking services or capital and they really are a very creative group. And for our business as a whole obviously, we're not dependent on SVB or sort of risks that come close to the regional banking places. I don't know Mark if \u2013 what you would add? Mark McCaffrey : Yes, it's a good inquiry. When you think about our ARPU at $197 and the cost of that to our customers and the value that we provide to them in new business, not a real impact there. Even when you talk about the FDIC limits and all that and the micro businesses and entrepreneurs, we think our customers are optimistic and we're seeing them eager to sell in the marketplace but we're not seeing any limitations based on the banking prices. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you for the question. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Zgutowicz from The Benchmark Company. Mark, please go ahead. Mark Zgutowicz : Thank you. Good evening. Just a couple of quick ones. Your A&C revenue guide for this year ,it looks like potentially a modest sequential decline if you look on a two-year stack basis throughout the year. So I'm just curious with new products coming to \u2013 does the market an infancy there, what that might be attributed to? And related if you can maybe speak to the attachment rates you're seeing early on with your OmniCommerce rollout and whether there are any initial demand signals that you'd like to share? And then last on the 2Q and annual revenue growth guides, if there's any material contribution from payables \u2013 payable domains and then and also from Worldpay? Thank you. Mark McCaffrey : Okay. So I'm going to hand \u2013 there was a few things in there Mark. So I'm going to try to go through them sequentially. If I miss anything, please point it out. A&C revenue guide, we are really excited about the 12% in Q1, showing great momentum coming into the year. We talked about it. This is the first quarter in which we had all four pillars in market. And that we've been engaging our customers converting our existing customer base in the US and just unbelievable traction. And we're also seeing play out is that the stickiness of going from the one to the two to the three products is playing out and improving \u2013 I want to say improving our refunds but lowering our refunds to our customers. So we saw a benefit of that in Q1. We are early stage though. So we \u2013 it's one quarter in and we like the momentum. We'll see how it rolls out throughout the year but we feel excited about the ability to continue that momentum throughout the year and into 2024. I think on the attach of the OmniCommerce, Aman, do you want to talk about it? Aman Bhutani : Maybe, I'll just talk about attach more broadly real quick and then get into OmniCommerce as well. We talked about bundling a little bit. And as Mark said bundling is a great option for us to bring two-plus products to our customers and it helps obviously not just the average order size but it helps with the retention, because customers that engage with more than one product tend to retain at higher rate. And that's an area of focus for us and we're pretty excited about where we're going. On the OmniCommerce issue, we've had great success selling into our base but it's still very, very early days. Very similar to your question about payable domain. I'm super excited about payable domains. We have some early results that I indicated and there's more to do. But all of these things we're very early in the process. We're very excited about the opportunity in the future. And overall the attach of these products to our existing customers continues to be good. I think in terms of sharing specific numbers on that, we'd want to have it reach certain milestones so we can share more with you. Mark McCaffrey : And on the Worldpay, we had talked about that last quarter. We're really excited about the Worldpay agreement in the -- they're selling our product in the market. We have a -- I would say a hard launch in the second half of the year. Minimal impact this year we're planning on. But going into next year, it should have some great momentum. Mark Zgutowicz : Great. Thanks guys. Appreciate it. Mark McCaffrey : Thank you. Aman Bhutani : Thanks. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Ygal Arounian from Citi. Ygal, please go ahead. Ygal Arounian : Hey, good afternoon, everyone. So I want to ask about AI. Apologies, if it has been asked. But I know you mentioned some of the generative AI, prompt library and some things you're doing on that front. But certainly recently but really over the past couple of months there's been a greater dialogue about generative AI disrupting the web builder business. And I want to get your thoughts on that, how you're approaching it and how you think about AI maybe not just in the near-term but over the long-term as well? Aman Bhutani : Well, Ygal thanks for that question. And no it hasn't been asked yet. So let me just take a moment and just take a step back to talk about the long-term and then give you a couple of examples of how we're thinking about it in the immediate term. Obviously like many other folks we want a future where AI is a positive contributor to humanity and society as a whole. And we're absolutely aligned with that view of the world. Where we see opportunities and some of them are a little ways away, some of them are sooner, is that AI creates moments of delight and surprise for customers. It allows us to create a new set of tools that allow customers to get more value faster easier, so they can focus on the things that they need to do growing their business and they have to worry less about the mechanics of things that technology can take care of. And that is the history of tools. Tools make -- allow people to do things that they otherwise would have had a hard time doing. And AI for us and in our business, in our industry I think is going to provide another set of new tools for our customers. In terms of how our customers think about this I happen to sit on, like, yesterday for two hours in the seat next to one of our customers that customer actually uses our entire solution from GoDaddy Studio to the website to the hardware device in their store and we had a great conversation for two hours. And I asked him about AI and what he feels as a micro business owner. And his point was very, very simple, which actually aligns with our company's view of it. He said, of course I want AI to help me message a customer or prompt me and tell me what the customer is asking about so I can help my customer. But my business relies on the personal relationship I have. And this him I'm talking, I have with our customer. And I don't want a machine talking to our customers. The difference happens in our business because of the owner himself his wife, who's the creative person behind that business. They are the ones that make the difference. So they want to hold that interaction. And for them AI is a tool. And frankly, if GoDaddy can make it easier by using AI tools to make it easier for them to engage with their customers, they're all for that. But at the end of the day it is about tools and not about replacing what they actually do for them. If you translate that into our business, we -- well, one a large part of our business domains hosting and other is sort of not related to AI in the same way. But when it comes to content creation, when it comes to websites, what we see for the foreseeable future is great opportunities to create new set of capabilities for customers that allow micro businesses to compete with larger businesses in a manner that has not been seen before. And that's what we're focused on and we're very excited about achieving that. Ygal Arounian : Okay. That's really helpful. I think some of the ways -- it's been depicted about how AI disrupts your business model. So, a little bit too simplistic. So it's good to hear that from you. I think you also mentioned taking share within the website builder space. And you guys give your overall customer count but not the specific customer count on Websites + Marketing and Managed WordPress. So I wanted to maybe see if you can elaborate on that point a little bit more and get a little bit more color. Thanks. Aman Bhutani : Sure. As you know, Websites + Marketing allows, customers the best way the simplest way to build a high-performing website. And given the domains funnel that we have a lot of customers that we see are sort of folks with new ideas. It's their dream they want to take it to market and Website + Marketing provides them just a great, great way to start there. We do look at share numbers internally and we -- as you know, there's no sort of public way to look at website share, but we do spend time and energy understanding the counter websites and what our share in it and it is across all our presence products. And that's what we try to share with you to say, look, we see us taking share. And out of the product -- presence products we have actually Websites + Marketing continues to be doing the best. And we continue to keep it very focused on the customer serves well. We are not distracted about that product serving everybody. It has a target customer segment. It's doing a fantastic job. And of course, there's more to be done and we can talk about that separately. But I'm very happy that Websites + Marketing is continuing to take share. Ygal Arounian : Okay. Great. Just to be clear, your -- when you're talking about taking share, are you including WordPress on that or not? Aman Bhutani : We have overall taken share as well in the website space, but I didn't break it down by each of the Presence products we have. But amongst -- across the products the product that took the most share was Websites + Marketing. Ygal Arounian : Great. Thank you. Aman Bhutani : Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Ella Smith from Morningstar. Ella, please go ahead. Ella Smith : Hi. This is Ella from JPMorgan. First question is, I was wondering if you could speak more about your partnerships -- recently announced partnerships, specifically with Apple and Microsoft teams. Especially, I would appreciate if you could talk more about the Tap to Pay partnership, because that seems like a pretty unique opportunity. Thank you. Aman Bhutani : Yes. Super excited about the Tap to Pay opportunity. And obviously, I think all of you know well what the functionality offers. I think what GoDaddy has to bring that's a bit special is that we work with Apple directly to create a truly seamless experience. I would love to in a different setting showcase that for our analysts and customers on a bus tour or something. So you can actually, see how much easier it is when GoDaddy creates that what we call the seamless and intuitive experience. And our goal there really is to have a set of services or experiences for our customers that are also easy to use that the customer doesn't hesitate to use it. As you know, our customer is the micro business owner. And there is a cost for them to take on something new, right? Because they need to put energy into growing their business and not trying to learn new technology. So when we lower the friction bar when we make it easy for them the adoption is much faster. And that's the early signal with Tap to Pay as well that GoDaddy merchants are just very, very quickly adopting Tap to Pay. And there's actually much more we're going to give them with Tap to Pay. With Microsoft Teams, the idea there is that, we want to be able to serve our customers to any of the sort of services that they used to engage their customers. This is a new opportunity. It's something that we're exploring and are curious about, where as you well know Microsoft Teams has grown and sort of has very large user base. And what we're really offering is the payments capability within Teams. And it extends our existing sort of beautiful relationship with Microsoft through the productivity products already. Ella Smith : Great. That's super helpful. Thank you. And as a quick follow-up I know on the last question we spoke at length about the impacts of AI to the web tool side of the business. And you did say that you don't see much impact to the core platform side of the business but I just want to confirm that. Do you think that there's even on the back end any opportunity for AI destruction to domains and hosting, or is that just not as relevant at this juncture? Aman Bhutani : Actually, over the last couple of years, I've talked about it a little bit, but let me update some of my comments. At GoDaddy, we've been using AI to provide customers with better domain names and we've put more energy into that over the last two or three years. It was actually one of the things we had mentioned where when we had first seen the acceleration of the aftermarket that we were actually using machine learning models to find better names for customers that were available where they were available in the primary market or the secondary market., So there is an impact of AI into our core business. But that impact so far has been a positive one and one that creates tools that allows customers to find better things. And at least so far we have not found any reason for those technologies to be negative on a negative impact to us. Ella Smith : Perfect. Thank you, so much. Aman Bhutani : Thank you. Christie Masoner : This concludes our Q&A. I'll turn it back to Aman. Aman Bhutani : Thanks Christie. Just a quick shout out to all GoDaddy employees for another solid quarter. We are super excited about the execution of the company. We're clear in our strategy and it takes all of us to get it there. And we appreciate you taking the time today to join this call and ask us a few questions. Thank you.",

I'm Christie Masone, Head of Investor Relations; and with me today are Aman Bhutani, Chief Executive Officer; and Mark McCaffrey, Chief Financial Officer. Following prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions. If you'd like to ask a question on today's call, please use the raise hand feature in the webinar to be added to the queue. On today's call, we will be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures and other operating in-business metrics. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents may be found in the presentation posted to our Investor Relations site at investors.godaddy.net or in today's earnings release on our Form 8-K furnished with the SEC. Growth rates presented represent year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise noted. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements, such as those related to future financial results and our strategies or objectives with respect to future operations.  These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed in detail in our periodic SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statement that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, August 3, 2023. And except to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligations to update these statements because of new information or future events. With that, I'm pleased to introduce Aman. Aman Bhutani : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. At GoDaddy, our mission is to empower everyday entrepreneurs and make opportunity more inclusive for all. In Q2, we continued to make good progress on our mission, providing a breadth of solutions to a growing number of customers globally. The fundamental health of our business remains strong with new high-quality customers robust retention rates and improved attach. We continue to be on track for stronger growth and profitability in our business, exiting the year at approximately 7% revenue growth and 28% normalized EBITDA margin. For Q2, in our highly competitive Applications & Commerce segment, our revenue of $352 million outperformed our guide with 11% growth. We remain the leader in domains with a 3% growth in private registrations as domains under management grew in the quarter, offset by underperformance in the domain aftermarket. Hosting continues to stabilize from product improvements and the previously announced integration and divestitures of noncore hosting assets. Gross adds remain strong on efficient marketing while maintaining our customer retention for GoDaddy brand at 85%. And Customers are now bundling new solutions at a faster rate than we have ever seen before. Innovation, resulting in higher monetization through attach and pricing with strong retention underpins our confidence in the positive trajectory of our business and our ability to drive shareholder value for years to come. At GoDaddy, we are focused on creating value for customers through innovation strengthening product market fit, and driving towards a one-stop shop. We move quickly to understand and take advantage of the step function changes, generative AI buffers to our industry. In just a few months, we have already launched multiple new generative AI-based features that our customers are actively using to reduce their workload and there is more to come. As you know, our care organization has guided customers to success for over 25 years. And now for the first time, we can bundle each GoDaddy domain purchase with an AI-powered GoDaddy digital guide. The digital guide will automatically build a free personalized basic website, including a checkout path, they take payments. It proposes brand colors creates a free logo and embeds it in the basic website. It also creates marketing messages with our customers' logo and post to social media to generate traffic to their sites. The digital guide built on years of our experience, knows the journey of our customers from identity to presence to commerce and can automatically present solutions in a unique way so they can experience a new product in context. For example, the digital guy can configure e-mail or a new phone number and bring messages from SMS and social sites to our conversation\u2019s app, giving our customers one simple inbox that aggregates their customers' messages. And at the same time, the digital guide writes proposed responses practically removing the effort and time taken to respond to inbound messages. Bundling this with the domain purchase is different from anything else available across the industry. and GoDaddy is in a unique position to pursue this disruptive approach at scale. These new capabilities can improve loyalty and retention and bring differentiated offerings to our existing base of 21 million customers driving an increase in lifetime value. We are excited about bringing these new features to our customers and our teams have been energized to build new experiences powered by generative AI.  In November at our investor dinner in Tempe, we look forward to showing you demos of these new capabilities. As always, I also wanted to briefly touch on our three priorities : driving commerce through presence, delivering for Pros, and innovating in domains. -- on commerce, we continue to drive strong growth in our OmniCommerce solutions. Customers in our base continue to convert to GoDaddy payments at an impressive rate and attaching to our base was again the strongest component of our year-over-year GPV growth, which is on pace to more than double our last year's exit rate. We'll add to this momentum through our anticipated Q3 launch of GoDaddy payments in Canada as we deploy our successful U.S. playbook. Website plus marketing continues to perform well, and we are driving greater engagement with customers with new product launches. We know that higher engagement is correlated with higher retention rates, and we expect engagement to be a driver of website and commerce performance metrics.  On delivering for PROS, improvements in our Managed WordPress solutions have reached an important milestone, driving improvement in retention rates as customers begin to recognize and enhance solution. We now offer one of the industry's fastest, most secure and easiest managed word breast platforms. in a recent third-party performance benchmarking study, sites hosted on GoDaddy's WordPress loaded an impressive 2x faster, which results in improved search engine rankings for our customers, and domain customers are not the only ones with a digital gun. We have launched similar capabilities in the Pro hub and are measuring the time saved for Pros, including generating site content and client communications on innovation in domains, while bundling the GoDaddy digital guide and its enhanced offerings is the most exciting change we are bringing to domains. I wanted to quickly share an update on payable domains as well. payable domains made a meaningful contribution to GPV growth this quarter with healthy double-digit month-over-month growth. This is a unique product that only GoDaddy offers. And with GoDaddy's digital guide, we expect to continue to make it simpler for customers to understand and adopt it. In closing, we feel good about our continued progress and how our organization is positioned to take us into the next phase of our growth with strong applications and commerce momentum? We have also continued to be efficient with our marketing spend, especially with the improvements we have made in search engine marketing, and we are eager to duplicate those results in other channels. we expect growth to accelerate as we exit the year and remain committed to our growth algorithm with increasing margins and expanding free cash flow per share, and we remain eager to continue to deliver value for all GoDaddy stakeholders. With that, here's Mark. Mark McCaffrey : Thanks, Aman. In just the last few years, GoDaddy, successfully built a growing competitive and robust set of tools and services, including our websites plus marketing product and OmniCommerce solution at a one-stop shop, empowering entrepreneurs to build and manage their ventures and accept payments with a dedicated partner by their side. The product innovation and targeted investment over this period has led to a better suite of products. And with our soon-to-be launched GoDaddy digital guide, we will provide an even further differentiated experience for our customers. propelling long-term growth for GoDaddy through faster product attachment and stronger retention.  As we consider the many headwinds we faced in the first half of the year, we are thrilled with the continued momentum of our applications in commerce revenue and the acceleration in our Create & Grow solutions. Our durable model continues to generate free cash flow, and we expect to reaccelerate our growth and improve our profitability as we exit the year while delivering on our cash flow targets. Moving to our financial results. Our applications and commerce revenue grew to $352 million, up 11%, surpassing our guide of 8% to 10% and delivering a segment EBITDA margin of 41%. The strength in our Applications & Commerce segment is fueled by our create gross solutions, which accelerated to $465 billion in ARR, up 11%. Additionally, we drove rapid growth in GPV comparable to last quarter, and we are on pace to more than double the 2022 exit rate by the end of the year. as we continue to attract and convert customers within our 21 million base to GoDaddy payments. ARR for applications and commerce grew 10% to more than $1.3 billion. with a 20% growth in annualized GMV to over $33 billion. Core platform revenue totaled $696 million, flat year-over-year with a segment EBITDA margin of 27%. ARR for our core platform segment was $2.3 billion. Core platform revenue was supported by 3% growth in domains on stronger customer additions from higher demand and price increases. This was primarily offset by greater-than-expected declines in our aftermarket on aftermarket. Revenue decreased 5% to $101 million on a tough compare from last year. Over the last five years, we've built upwards of a $400 million revenue two-sided marketplace. As a reminder, this business allows a buyer and seller to transact on our platform at their agreed upon valuation. This business rapidly grew as we scaled the operations, participants, and partnerships. What we see now is a post-COVID normalization of this business as valuation of larger transactions have decreased and volume growth has slowed. With that, we expect steady low to mid-single-digit top-line growth for the business on a go-forward basis. On our core platform restructuring initiative, we completed the migration of Media Temple and Main Street Hub customers to the GoDaddy technology stack. And the 123 Reg migration is planned to be completed by the end of the year. As expected, these migrations produce a slightly elevated churn on these brands this quarter, but will deliver further cost efficiencies in the future. The retention rate of customers for the GoDaddy branded products remains above 85%.  Total revenue grew to $1.05 billion up 3% on a reported basis and 4% excluding aftermarket. Constant currency revenue increased 4%. Within total revenue, international revenue grew 3% on a reported basis. and 6% on a constant currency basis. Our ARPU grew 3% to $199 from $193 last year, and we added 100,000 net new high-quality customers despite the headwinds from our migration efforts.  Normalized EBITDA grew 2% set to $265 million, while delivering a margin of 25%. Bookings totaled $1.1 billion, growing 2% on a reported basis. and 4%, excluding aftermarket and the impact of the integration of non-core assets. Bookings grew 3% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the impact of aftermarket, the drivers of growth in bookings were strong customer additions and price increases in domains as well as strong attach in applications and commerce. We expect these factors to contribute to accelerated revenue growth next year.  Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter totaled $284 million, growing 3%. While free cash flow was relatively flat at $240 million despite increased interest-related payments. Free cash flow per share rose to $6.44 on a trailing 12-month basis. versus the prior year's cash flow per share of $5.67, a 14% increase driven by execution, operating leverage, and share repurchases.  Through July 31, we repurchased 10.2 million shares year-to-date, totaling $746 million, of which $632 million was repurchased since the end of Q1. This brings the cumulative share repurchase under the current authorization to $2 billion and 27.1 million shares, reducing shares outstanding since the inception of this authorization by 16% and we remain on part for our commitment to reduce our fully diluted shares outstanding by 15% to 20% over the three-year period.  Additionally, today, we announced an incremental $1 billion share buyback authorization to bring the total authorization to $4 billion and extending the program out to 2025. On the balance sheet, we finished Q2 with $583 million in cash and total liquidity of $1.6 billion. Net debt stands at $3.3 billion with a 2.9 times net leverage within our targeted range of 2 times to 4 times. Lastly, we secured a 75-basis point interest rate reduction on $1.8 billion of outstanding principal through a refinance issued at par. This refinance is expected to save $13 million annually in interest payments for each of the next seven years. Moving on to our outlook. We are targeting Q3 total revenue in the range of $1.055 billion to $1.075 billion, representing growth of 3% at the midpoint. With the current momentum, we expect to exit the year at approximately 7% top-line growth with a normalized EBITDA of 28%, an increase of 300 basis points from our 2021 exit rate of 25%. We are increasing our growth expectations for applications and commerce to be between 9% and 11% for Q3 and the full year. In our core platform segment, we expect revenue to be flat in Q3 and reaccelerate in the fourth quarter to deliver 1% growth for the full year.  Q3 Normalized EBITDA margin is expected to improve to approximately 26% with continued acceleration over the fourth quarter, resulting in a full-year normalized EBITDA margin of approximately 26%. This is a 300-basis point increase from our 2021 rate of 23% on better operating leverage from improved marketing performance, restructuring efforts benefits from our continued move of loads to cloud and the incorporation of AI into our operating model. On the growth bridge we spoke about last quarter, we remain confident in the path to accelerated revenue growth. While expanding margins and improving cash flows.  As a reminder, this year's revenue growth rate includes approximately two points of FX pressure from last year's bookings. Difficult compares in our aftermarket business and the migration and divested certain non-core assets. We expect momentum in bookings in the second half of the year to drive the reacceleration of revenue growth as we exit the year while we remain committed to delivering our margin expansion and free cash flow targets. We will be posting our annual investor dinner with product demonstrations in November at our Planning and Investor Day in Q1 '2024, we consider both a great opportunity to share more about our exciting initiatives in AI and our outlook for the next three years. In closing, we remain confident in our ability to execute in the areas of our business within our control and deliver the full-year targets. As always, we remain focused on executing against our strategic priorities, committed to being responsible stewards of capital, and strive every day to provide a one-stop shop to micro businesses, along their entrepreneurial journey with an eye towards balanced long-term growth and profitability. With that, we will have Christie Masoner from our Investor Relations team to open the call all for questions. A - Christie Masoner : Thanks, Mark. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Matt Pfau from William Blair. Please go ahead. Matt Pfau : Great. Thanks, for taking my questions. Two of them. First, I wanted to ask on the acceleration of the core business in the fourth quarter in Pleasant healthy sequential increase. Maybe you can just discuss what are the factors that are driving that increase. Mark McCaffrey : Yes. Thanks, Matt. When we look at Q2 and bookings and kind of trade off in the second half of the year, a couple of things to consider : one, -- we have FX that will be abating. We have pricing increases that we did towards the end of the quarter, which should help with our bookings and somewhat revenue into this year. Obviously, the aftermarket compares get better going into Q4. And now that we've completed some of our migrations to the core GoDaddy stack, we should see start -- some of those start to abate as we get through the half year.  So that gives us the confidence that we will have that accelerating growth rate as we get through the remainder of this year. That, coupled with some of the demand we're seeing at the front of the funnel with customers coming in, attaching new products faster. Our retention rates remaining strong and the momentum we have in application commerce, we feel good about that momentum coming out of Q4 and going into 2024. Matt Pfau : Great. And on the digital guide, maybe you can just help us understand what that rollout is going to look like? Is it just going to be for new customers? Or do you plan to roll that out to your existing base as well? Aman Bhutani : Thanks, Matt. Yes, we plan to roll it out to the existing base as well. The digital is about literally a guide that works for a customer, even when the customer is sleeping. So even with the base, the guy will be able to offer or create new offerings for them. So, it will start with new, just like a lot of other products do, but you'll see us quickly take it to the base as well. Matt Pfau : Great. Thanks, for taking my questions. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Kesavabhotla from Baird. Vikram please go ahead. Vikram Kesavabhotla : I wanted to ask about the applications and commerce segment. It looks like you raised the expectation there for fiscal '23. Maybe if you could talk some more about the primary drivers behind that revision. And then separately, I also wanted to ask about the EBITDA margins. It looks like you posted about 25% in the second quarter. You're guiding to 26% in 3Q and exiting the year at 28%. Could you just talk through some of the main drivers of the expansion there throughout the balance of the year? Thanks. Mark McCaffrey : I'll start with the application commerce. We can continue to -- sorry, we continue to see strong momentum in the front of the tunnel and customer bundling payments and choosing payments are coming through with websites really happy and excited about that attach and that bundling that's happening at the front of the funnel. Again, I alluded to, we have really strong net gross customer adds coming in and they're getting to that bundled product quicker with that, that gets us to higher retention rates. That, coupled with some pricing increases we're doing at the back half of Q2, where we did at the back half of Q2 should start to show up in applications and comments as we go.  Also seeing great momentum on the conversion. We've talked about it previously, but our existing customers converting over to the GoDaddy payments. That motion is well in work, and we're seeing that AGV grow as we go out throughout the year. On the margin expansion, we had about 25%. We're forecasting to get up 28%. We have a couple of things going on there. We're seeing greater marketing efficiency, which is helping us. We are really starting to see the benefits of moving into the cloud. We're seeing the cost efficiencies that are coming with more workloads and that are really starting to take hold as we hit certain milestones throughout the year.  We also had the restructuring in Q2. And some of that will gain steam as we go into the back half of the year and overall momentum as we go through there. So, we have a lot of, I would say, moving parts that are all pointing in the same direction that make us feel good about expanding our margins while expanding our growth rate as well through applications of coverage. Vikram Kesavabhotla : Great. Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Trevor Young from Barclays. Trevor please go ahead. Trevor Young : Great. First, on core platform now expecting around 1% growth for the full year within the main lines there, aftermarket domains ex aftermarket and security and hosting, which linear line are kind of underperforming relative to your prior expectations. And then second one on that AI-powered digital guide, do you view that as kind of complementary to the higher-touch customer care organization? Or do you see that functionality eventually kind of helping alleviate some of the cost or headcount within the care organization? Mark McCaffrey : Thanks, Trevor. I'll start with the aftermarket and the core platform. We really saw underperformed this quarter. We've grown a $400 million business there over a number of years. We saw a lot of growth back half of '21 coming into '22. So, no doubt we have compares. But as we've talked previously, the larger transactions and the valuations on them have abated. We're seeing the volumes slowing growth as well coming on Q2. And to put it in perspective, we're seeing great demand and gross ads within our funnel, but it seems the valuations on the aftermarket still are connecting with the buyers. So, we're seeing them lean towards the domain growth. And we think this is a normalization for now. I think we -- we've taken it out of our back half of the year expectations, and we think this is going to be a low to mid-single-digit growth business going forward. So, I would really point to the aftermarket on this as being part. Aman Bhutani : And Trevor, on the digital guide, we couldn't be more excited about bearing a guide with every domain purchase and letting that digital guide the customer just like we do in care. We've done a phenomenal job in care over the last few years by sort of creating leverage on the Care line item as revenue grew, we get costs pretty flat. And it's a little early to be talking about the impacts of AI. But overall, we do see leading to efficiencies in our business overall. And frankly, we've already showed that in Marketing, where by implementing machine learning, we're able to make our spend more and more efficient. And we've been seeing the results of that over the last year already. Trevor Young : Great. Thank you, both. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Naved Khan from B. Riley. Naved please go ahead. Naved Khan : Thanks. Just a question on the outlook. So, 28% EBITDA margin by Q4. If I have to think about next year, 2024, and I know you're not guiding to that, but is there any reason why 28% shouldn't be the base? To start with, I mean, the cost savings will still be layering in because this is not a full year for cost savings, right? So, am I thinking about it the right way? Just any comment there would be helpful. And then I have a follow-up. Mark McCaffrey : Yes. Naved, thanks. We're excited on our Investor Day coming up in the first quarter, and we'll get more into the details of what we'll look like. We're really excited about our margin expansion going into Q4, the 28%, if we look back to the Q4 in 2021, we've increased our margins by 300 basis points. Even year-over-year, we get to the same 300 basis points. So, it's something we continue to work on. We continue to find efficiencies in our operation, and we'll continue to push margin growth going into 2024. At the same time, we're accelerating revenue and hitting our cash flow objectives well.  So, I don't want to give you too much of a leading what 2024 is going to look like, but we're really excited about our progress, the work we've done in the first half of the year and how that's going to benefit us in the back half of the year and then ultimately into 2024. Naved Khan : Got it. And then the -- you kind of alluded to the bridge to sort of resumption of growth or healthy growth, right? So -- and the one that you shared last call was, I think, getting you back into the double digits. So, if I have to think about when you start to see like the full -- the effect of full anniversary-ing and kind of getting to that, how should I think about timing? Is it Q1? Is it early next year? At what point would be kind of this would be in the real war for you? Mark McCaffrey : Yes. Thanks. And try not to peg a specific timetable here as we're getting into the back half of the year. We'll talk more about it later. But when we look at the full-year guide this year and we kind of look at the impact of FX, the difficult aftermarket compares and migrations and divestitures we're doing -- they will start to abate into the fourth quarter and continue to abate and turn into tailwinds as we go through 2024. Not trying to pick a quarter on anything right now. We'll talk more about that later in the year. But the momentum has us accelerating revenue as we go through units. Aman Bhutani : And if I could just add, Long term, we're excited about the path to accelerating growth because it's based on the simple idea that create products that can lead the customer through the entrepreneur\u2019s wheel, which you remember is about leading them through identity to presence to commerce really creates a flywheel for the company. our technology has improved in a very significant way. That leads to greater attach, not just for new customers for our base as well. That involves identifying a customer that is most connecting and reaching out and engaging the customer and then closing the customer.  Of course, you've seen us do it successfully with e-mail over the last three years, four years where that business has product business has performed very well for us. And now you're seeing it us do it with the OmniCommerce solution as well where a GPV has grown nicely, and we can clearly see that we have a ton of customers in our base that would love that product from us. So, at the core, our path to long-term path to accelerating growth is about innovation in the product. It's creating value for the customer that leads to monetization opportunities like attach like pricing and strong retention that come together to sort of give us the confidence we're sharing with you about the positive momentum in our business, and that's what we believe will drive long-term shareholder value for years and years to come. Mark McCaffrey : And if I could just add to that and to clarify, we -- while we look out in '24, we are reaffirming our guidance for 2023 in the range for revenue just FYI [ph]. Naved Khan : Thank you, guys. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Brent please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : This is John Ben for Brent Thill. First question GMV had pretty good growth accelerate 20% year-over-year and also up 18% sequentially. Just wondering what might have be some of the drivers? I mean, are you seeing any sort of improvement in macro and GMV per customer? Or is it just better attached, if you could parse that, that would be great. Aman Bhutani : Yes. GMV growing as a function of sort of the macro to start with. We are seeing more of our existing customers transact more with the solutions they have. To remind you, a lot of our GMV is a function of the relationship we have through the bank. So, it's a different financial model for us, but it gives us a great barometer. It gets our product out there. We get to see sort of what's happening in the world. So, we are very happy with the growth and it basically signifies more and more people using the GoDaddy solutions for their businesses, both off-line and in store Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks. And maybe any update on the FIS Worldpay partnership? Aman Bhutani : Partnership is doing great. We have launched the product with them. We have a set of customers that are using our new solutions, still very early since we're only about a month in, I think, from the launch. So, it's still pretty early, but very happy with the progress. I dare say that our partners are pretty excited about the progress too. And I think they can't wait to get out there and sell it more and we can't wait to see those customers. Mark McCaffrey : And we'd always said the impact on 2024 was -- sorry, 2023 is going to be minimal, and we would start to see the momentum of that going into 2024, which again adds very excitement about that momentum. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Godoi from Benchmark. Mark please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, guys. This is Alex on for Mark. Just a question on payable domains. So last quarter, you characterized contribution is modest, and it sounds like there was meaningful performance in 2Q from payable domains. Just curious if you could perhaps discuss what was the most meaningful driver for that -- for the outperformance in applications in commerce or whether or not payable domains as a material driver of that. Aman Bhutani : Yes. I'll maybe let Mark talk at on commerce and sort of payable domain, I'd probably say it's still very early and OmniCommerce is pretty big. But let me sort of step back and answer your question around what's driving the growth of payable domains. Obviously, you're very aware, we have 21 million customers. We have 84 million domains under management. We have a ton of opportunity to attach this new and unique product. That's why you hear the excitement from me on it on a continuous basis. And of course, the math adds up very quickly, the more customers we can get on it. The biggest drivers over the last quarter for payable domains is we started to really surface payroll domain in the journey and engagement that happy with us because it's still a new concept for people. Our customers don't automatically understand that they've brought the domain and with a couple of clicks, they can start taking payments. So, we found better ways to guide the customer through that path, get them live with the capability. And what we find is once we get them live with that capability, sure enough, they start to transact, right? And you know our overall math in terms of retention rate. We have -- if we have one product with a customer, they tend to retain sort of mid-80s. If we have two, it jumps. If we have three products with a customer, we pretty much have a customer for life.  And the LTV also goes to 80x, 83x once they have commenced with us. So, all of that math is working, but it's dependent on us getting more people to adopt this product, and that's what you started to see in Q2, when more people saw the product go, I didn't know this was there. Let me add it. Let me start using it, and that's what sort of created the quick, if you will, double-digit month-over-month growth in the GPV. Hopefully, that makes sense. Mark McCaffrey : Yes. And I'll add on applications comments in general, where we're really excited is strong gross customer adds are coming in and coming stronger than we've seen in a long time. Not only are they coming into the funnel, they are getting to that second product -- and whether it's payable domains, whether it's payments, whether it's commerce, whether it's wet like marketing, they're bundling those together at the initial stages. We think the digital guide will also accelerate that as that starts to at faster rate.  But when that happens, when like man said, when we get to that second product, that third product, we get to a third product attached, generally, we find we have a customer for life, and that really drives the all this because the decisions around it are being made faster on the top of the funnel, help us get there faster and drive that LTV equation. Obviously, it helps to -- with our cash flow, and it helps us be more efficient because we're getting greater revenue prices or getting better revenue and a better efficient operating margin as well.  So, we feel really good about all that happening in the applications and commerce. It's really driving a lot of momentum. We have that on top of the hardware sales that we are seeing that are driving that momentum as well, a lot of positivity coming right? And it all starts with the domain and innovating in the demand. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Ygal Arounian from Citi. Ygal please go ahead. Ygal Arounian : I'm not re-asking this, but I want to start on domains. We continue to kind of see some, let's say, challenging growth from [indiscernible]. I know you guys are involved in, and other TLDs two, which if there's interesting things to point out about that, we'd love to hear. But just maybe just some of what you're seeing around that expectations for when that can start to normalize, how that's impacting the aftermarket? And then a really interesting comment about channel partners who are pushing more on ARPU than they were on new users. And I don't know if there's something to comment around that? Do you think that, that's having an impact? You guys have a big hand in both sides. So, would love to hear your view on that. Aman Bhutani : Yes. Happy to give a bit of color on domains. Obviously, I think you probably saw already domains under management for GoDaddy grew. So definitely, we're doing well on units as well. And to sort of explain a little bit where -- as Mark said, we're seeing better traffic and demand coming to our site. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, some of that is because of our focus in search engine marketing and us significantly improving our abilities to spend money and search and convert those customers.  So, we're very happy with that as well. And one other maybe mentions to mention to you is that we've continued to grow well internationally. As Mark shared, we grew 6% internationally on a reported basis, 3% constant currency, 6%. And the product we lead with internationally is domains, right? Domains is the number one thing we sell in small markets around the world, we have customers in over 100 markets.  So, it's the combination of those things that I would say that are leading to the best results for us. And our Domains business is broader than any other one particular registry business. You mentioned that yourself, and that's absolutely true. We're the market leader. We have a diverse set of assets within the domains business. We've continued to innovate in many of those areas. And the key pieces where we see good returns this we'll be very efficient in marketing and search, grow the dumps, grow the customers, get customers to the stick, can work them while attach products to them, which obviously isn't what you're asking about, but attach rate products to them and do it around the world really well. Hopefully, that's a bit helpful. Ygal Arounian : Yes. That's really helpful. And so maybe to segue, I think it's similar. I don't know. A lot of the answers might actually be an overlap. But if there's anything incremental to add. So, just on the gross top of the funnel, gross adds commentary, which feels really strong. And I know you have some noise in your in the new customer number, I believe, still ongoing with some of the sunsetting of the brands. Is there any way to parse out that?  And then what -- is it -- to your point, when you talk about with the SEM work that you're doing that's driving that strength in the top of funnel with domains. Even if your domains under management grew, demand is kind of like, let's say, collectively still soft your commentary around the really strong top of the funnel, I think, stands out. So, I wanted to maybe understand that a little bit better. Thank you. Aman Bhutani : Yes. Yes. So, gross ads were strong for us, and it was on efficient marketing spend. And I did highlight in the prepared remarks, and I think you repeated that which is that search was a strong contributor to that. And what I added to that is that it's not just search in the U.S., it's search globally. That did a really good job sort of delivering for us.  But it's not a search alone. We have been focused on improving our marketing, the targeting of our migraine, and the measurement of our marketing over the last couple of years. I think we've talked about it multiple different times has been an important priority for us. And what we're seeing as a result is more people show up to the website, right? More people going through the funnel better.  I think one of the things I've talked about, and I don't know if this is what you're asking about. But One of the things in the past that I've talked about is that we have shifted as a company, and we are very much an experimentation-based culture now. teams go out and they try different things and then measure closely whether there's a conversion improvement or not. And that, of course, helps as well, right, where when we land better traffic and conversion is up on the site, that delivers better for us. Whereas in the past, maybe years ago, we may have relied on a combination of the site and care more, what we find now is that the site performs really well. And that's a great way for us to attract gross ads, and we're pretty happy with that result. Mark McCaffrey : Yes. And I'll just add to that. What we really like about the gross ads coming in is they are customers that have a higher propensity to want to do business and therefore, are attaching a lot faster. And on the churn on the other hand, we are losing the migration and lifting of some of these products. But that relates to what we refer to as [indiscernible] customers that weren't growing the business for necessarily using the functionality. And therefore, we're trading in a good direction as we get to those net ads. Ygal Arounian : Right. I have a follow-up, but I don't want to I'll jump back in the queue and then... Aman Bhutani : It's okay, go ahead. Ygal Arounian : Yes. Okay. So, then this is all super helpful. I love this color. So, you and your peers on the kind of closed-end platforms seem to be all driving efficient marketing spend that's bringing more share were really across the board. And then going back and tying that back into the kind of, let's just say, flattish domains globally, right? It feels like your space is taking a lot of the share of the web-building ecosystem. Is that a fair characterization? And where do you see the share coming from? I think we talked about World Press in the past and maybe you could just help on that. Thanks. Aman Bhutani : Yes. And we'll provide more color on this at Investor Day for sure, to talk about how website share is shifting. And overall, I think there was -- if we look at the last few quarters, there's more pressure on world press at least from what we saw then, if you go back many years. But taking a longer-term view, the share is still coming from custom HTML sites. That is what is reducing. And there is sort of growing demand and obviously, the new demand goes more towards the newer tools that exist, right, you find that's easier and easier for customers to build sites themselves and get started.  Like our two websites for marketing does a fantastic job of that. You see us at GoDaddy with the digital guy taking the next step. We we're telling you today, and we'll show it to you live with testing with customers. We'll show you live in November in Tempe. How -- when a customer buys a domain, how they behave differently instead of just a domain, you give them a website and get them started. Because the friction for a customer to make another decision and then create content and then do another thing is pretty difficult.  But of course, technology has made this easier and easier over time and now generative AI allows our industry to take the next step in terms of reducing the effort that customers have to do to get started. So, I think you're going to continue to see the momentum. Of course, there are secular trends underneath of entrepreneurship, population, people coming to the Internet. But what how quickly they're able to adopt the tools on the Internet and get a presence up and running, I think you'll continue to see good momentum in that because technology and generative AI now are going to make a real difference. Ygal Arounian : Thank you so much. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from Chris Kentaro from Morgan Stanley. Chris, please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : This is Christian Kentaro on for the listed quarter. I wanted to ask around the macro and kind of how it's changed Q2 versus Q1. And then the second question would be around the digital guide. Are these capabilities kind of like table six for the industry? Or how do you think about your ability to drive your differentiation in AI against your web-building competitors? Thank you. Aman Bhutani : No, I can't believe you said table stakes for a digital guide, but let me take your first question first. You surprise me with that. Let's start with the macro. There are a few items that sort of we look at on our dashboard or the leaders in our organization look at when we look at macro and I'll try to touch on a couple of them to give you a bit of color. One of them that we look at is sort of nonbrand demand that's coming to Google as a representation of demand. And are people going out and searching for things? And they're not searching for a particular company, they're just searching for a website, they're just searching for a domain and how is that trending? And what we saw in that data is that there are a few markets in the world and actually the English-speaking markets where we are strong, the U.K. being one of them, we see a good lift in nonbrand demand for the terms that we track. And that's a positive sign for those markets. That means we expect better demand. We expect to spend more money there. And generally, the customer, the everyday entrepreneur is feeling better and wants to engage and buy a domain, start a business or build their business, or so on. The second group geographically I'll talk about is the markets that are not big English-speaking markets, but what we call the rest of the world. And there, what we see is sort of more similar or flattish behavior in terms of nonbrand searches, those -- as you can see, the international market does really well for us. So, that's been phenomenal. GoDaddy has done a lot to take share globally on those. But in terms of raw demand or macro, what we see is much, much more time sort of behavior. And the U.S. is somewhere a little bit in the middle. I won't comment sort of broad macro on the U.S. of you understand it better than I probably do. But Rod, if I talk about demand on the terms that we track to, there's some good news, but not as good as a couple of the other markets. And the second data point to look at is customer -- consumer confidence, and we track that for all of our main markets. And what we see there, again, is sort of an expectation for many of that confidence would go down, and it was probably trending down in some of those markets, but over the last two months, three months, a little bit of a reversal. So, maybe instead of going down towards, we see more flat. But in some markets, and again, I'll mention the U.K., you actually see it coming off, which I think you didn't expect if you're just sort of a macro person. And there are other markets that are sort of showing different behavior as well. But hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color on a couple of the core metrics that we look at and a couple of sort of a little bit of a geographic lens on it. In terms of the digital guide, which I think was a second question, I just want to reiterate the digital guide is a technology built using AI that uses generative AI to generate content that uses AI for a lot of other purposes. And our goal is to couple that with every domain in purchase. So, when you buy a domain, a digital guy is automatically enabled for that customer. And what it's trying to do is find that best experience and path for that particular customer and get them through that path, whether it's adding new products, whether it's posting something, whether it's reminding them or something. And it's not trying to do it in a way that says, \"Hey, come buy this from me. What it's doing is it's actually doing the work for the customer in advance and then say, take a look. If you like this, we can keep that, right? So, I don't think of that as stable stakes at all.  If I look at -- and I'm not even talking about our industry, if I look at sort of across the technology landscape. Of course, there are technologies out there and a lot of people want to do similar things. But I don't see anyone starting at the point of a domain name. And we have AI or generative AI-ready capabilities. We're already testing many of these things. And I think in the past, I've talked about them. or last quarter, I mentioned one or two of them. But we have capabilities that are live today that are being tested with customers. And there isn't anyone else that's going to bring it to millions of the main names and set people off the way we want to start right. So, that's the big thing. And I guess, for folks that may have joined just a minute or two late. There was a great little video that we started with today, and I assume we've posted somewhere I'm pointing to one. I assume we post it, it's that two-minute video is a great way for you to understand what our -- what we want to our customers to experience. And how much effort we are taking away from the customer that one customer would have to do and letting the digital guy do that. And believe it or not, that happens today in care right now. Customers call us and what they want is that they want us to give them confidence, and they want us to encourage them. And at the same time, they want us to solve their problems and give them access to more tools. And we do all of that -- and we're trying to take the learning that we have in care and enable every customer with it so that we can scale to literally every customer that buys with us. Mark McCaffrey : I'll add one of the distinctions we have is from identity to presence, to commerce, we have the entire technology set. So, when we use generative AI, we could take it across their entire journey, and we start with the domain, and that makes that journey faster gets us the bundling faster, gets us to customers for life for us, and driving LTV into our financials. So, we're really excited about it. But one of the great distinctions is we have the entire technology stack around it to use they are around. Unidentified Analyst : Maybe one other quick thing I'll add is that I think we learned last year that having people see and demo working functionality to them that customers can see is very powerful. So, I would invite all of you, and I know many of you joined. So, I would invite all of you to Tempe in November. So, you can do it yourself with us, demoing it without showing you what that experience is for our customers. And then I think it will sort of illuminate the idea in a much better way. Aman Bhutani : And the temperature is much cooler in November. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Navid Khan from B. Riley. Please go ahead. Navid Khan : Okay good. Yes, a quick follow-up. So, one is we saw a transaction, Google domains being sold to Square space. And I wanted to get your thoughts on what it means for the other participants such as yourself in terms of competition. And then the other question I had was on the price increase on the A&C segment. What was the magnitude of the increase? Aman Bhutani : Yes. Let me take the domains piece first. And then, Mark, if you want to touch on the pricing or I can touch on that to Peter. On the Google domain space, the way we look at it, Navid, is that anytime there's a transition like this, there's a disruption in the customer experience or flow. Customers tend to put their heads up and they'll look at what other options might exist for them.  And given our brand awareness and leadership position in the world of domains, given the care we provide given our high transactional NPS, and just sort of broad understanding from a very large number of people what GoDaddy brings to the table. And the more we attach to that bundle with that domain, I think we're positioned very well to see if some disruption happens that we're there and it's advantageous to us, right? In terms of beyond. But I think our goal is to just do a fantastic job delivering, providing customer\u2019s great products. And we think we're doing a good job at attracting customers, we're growing down. And I mean, maybe the way to say it is we were the leader in the mains when Google came into the business and we're a leader in domains when Google is leading the business. So, we're okay with that. And then on the AMC pricing, I assume the question is to website plus marketing pricing? I think. Mark McCaffrey : Yes. I don't think we've gotten into the magnitude of breaking down pricing by each of the different components of it. I'll give it a little color. I think last year, we focused mostly on pricing increases around renewals. This year, we're doing it on new as well as renewals. So, I would say than we did last year. Obviously, our priority is always retention rates in sticking with -- but we took those pricing increases at the end of Q2, and we should start to see them materialize as we go throughout the year. Navid Khan : Thank you. Mark McCaffrey : Thanks, Navid. Christie Masoner : I will now turn the call over to Aman for some closing remarks. Aman Bhutani : Thank you, Christie, and I'll just end by thanking all the GoDaddy employees for another good quarter. And just to remind all of our Anderson shareholders where -- we're super excited about the products we're bringing to market. We're super excited about attaching into our base that we've demonstrated with e-mail and are demonstrating with commerce now. We're super excited about the trajectory we have going into Q3 and Q4. Ending the year at accelerating growth and strong margin, setting up next year really well. I look forward to the next call. Thank you very much.",

    "content": "\ufeff Christie Masoner : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for GoDaddy's Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. I'm Christie Masoner, VP of Investor Relations. And with me today are Aman Bhutani, Chief Executive Officer; and Mark McCaffrey, Chief Financial Officer. Following prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions]. On today's call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures and other operating and business metrics. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents may be found in the presentation posted to our Investor Relations site at investors.goddady.net or in today's earnings release on our Form 8-K furnished at the SEC. Growth rates presented represent year-over-year comparisons, unless otherwise noted. The matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements such as those related to future financial results and our strategies or objectives with respect to future operations. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed in detail in our periodic SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, November 2, 2023. And except to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to update these statements because of new information or future events. With that, I'm pleased to introduce Aman. Aman Bhutani : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. At GoDaddy, our mission is to empower everyday entrepreneurs and make opportunity more inclusive for all. Our strategy centers on driving profitable growth, resulting in compounding free cash flow per share and long-term shareholder value. In recent years, we have proven our commitment through decisive actions and margin expansion even in slower growth conditions. Q3 was an important quarter for us. I am pleased with the results and the continued trajectory into Q4 and 2024. Third quarter normalized EBITDA margins jumped 250 basis points sequentially, primarily driven by a reduction in tech and dev spend, some of which was expected and some realized a quarter early. While margin improvement is increasingly evident in our financial performance, this stems from our earlier restructuring, brand integration and diligent efforts for over a year to drive cloud adoption, which unlock additional savings. As shared earlier this year, we are executing these changes in a deliberate and strategic manner with a commitment to ongoing cost structure management. The work we have done and our ongoing initiatives position us for sustained margin expansion in future quarters and years to come. Q4 will also benefit from margin improvement primarily from a reduction in tech and dev spend. Additionally, we are eager to see our high-margin segment applications and commerce grow faster since in time, that becomes an additional tailwind to our overall margin. Applications and commerce bookings grew 12% in Q3, and we are encouraged by that momentum. October has continued that trajectory with mid-teens bookings growth in applications and commerce. One of the key messages that I hope you take away from our results and my comments today is that the third quarter marked the turning point of our tech and dev spend as a few significant platform improvements and brand integrations start to be in the rearview mirror, and our product investments get past their peak. As a result of these dynamics, we are well positioned to exit 2024 with normalized EBITDA margin of approximately 31%, another significant step forward for our business. As we look at the next few years, we see leverage opportunities across the P&L. In care, leverage will be driven by consumer behavior, enhanced automation and the incorporation of generative AI. Within tech and dev, as already mentioned, we are actively pursuing opportunities for leverage with multiple initiatives. Furthermore, we remain committed to our disciplined approach in marketing and G&A. These strategies collectively chart a course for our continued margin expansion through 2025 and 2026, and we look forward to providing additional insights at our Investor Day early next year. As always, I want to take a few minutes and talk about our highest priority initiatives. We have added productivity explicitly to our priorities and changed the order. This was driven by the fast adoption of generative AI and new capabilities in bundling with domains and productivity, opening up new exciting opportunities. Elevating to our first priority, we have evolved innovation in domains to innovation in domains and productivity. We have enhanced the bundling capabilities for our productivity solutions which is already contributing to the faster growth in our applications and commerce segment, and we are taking it further. As you know, the integration of machine learning and use of AI is not new to GoDaddy. We have harnessed these technologies for several years, primarily in our care and marketing functions. Building upon this foundational expertise, we quickly became a leader in the generative AI space for our industry, with customer-facing capabilities in market since April. I am excited to showcase the first iteration of GoDaddy's digital guide now named GoDaddy Airo to you at our Investor Day later this month. As I had shared last quarter, this innovative experience empowers customers to access the full suite of GoDaddy products and additional partner products seamlessly just by acquiring a domain. In this experience, domain purchasers received an automatically generated basic website using generative AI and automatically generated logo, ready-to-use social post, personalized e-mail address and more, all delivered in an automated, low-friction manner. All of this is in service to making a significant improvement in the number of customers that have more than two products with us. As you are aware, customers with two plus products retain at much higher rates and have much higher lifetime value all the way to ADX for customers enabled. On driving commerce through presence, over the years, we have added elegant, functional, performant and fully featured capabilities at a fast pace to address the needs of our customers in a rapidly evolving and competitive environment. As a result, Google core web vitals recognizes GoDaddy's website builder built sites at the highest performing websites. This quarter, we have taken strides towards our vision in empowering our customers with even broader capabilities to help them grow their businesses with confidence. Our conversations feature has elevated the way our customers connect with their own customers, making it simpler and more effective than ever before. We are proud to announce that we are the first to integrate Google's business messages in the U.S. Furthermore, we have seamlessly integrated M365 e-mail and social direct messages, mentions and comments into our conversation platform, creating a unified all-in-one solution that is second to none. With these advancements, GoDaddy's website plus marketing can continue to serve larger and larger customers that have more complex needs. We also continued to drive strong growth in our omni-commerce solution. Our partnership with Worldpay has launched, and these customers are already transacting using our hardware and software. Customers in our base continue to convert to GoDaddy Payments at an impressive rate and attaching to our base was, again, the strongest component of our year-over-year GPV growth, which remains on pace to more than double our last year's exit rate. On delivering for Pros, we mentioned last quarter that improvements in our Managed WordPress solution have reached an important milestone, driving improvement in retention rates as customers begin to recognize an enhanced solution. We now offer one of the industry's fastest, most secure and easiest to use Managed WordPress platforms. In a recent third-party performance benchmarking study sites hosted on GoDaddy's WordPress loaded an impressive 2x faster, which results in improved search engine rankings for our customers. Now one quarter later, we are proud to share that these efforts drove impressive double-digit growth in Managed WordPress bookings, which is included in our applications and commerce segment. Additionally, these features are now enhanced with generative AI features to help deliver simplified experiences that expand on the enhancements we have made around performance and security, giving GoDaddy a clear value-based advantage. In just minutes, our customers can now create beautiful, secure and high-performing WordPress sites. In closing, we are committed to driving a strong combination of revenue growth plus profitability. As Mark will detail, based on the margin expansion efforts in 2022 and 2023 and our confidence in our ability for continued margin expansion in 2024, we see the path to further enhance profitability in 2025 and 2026, above the 31% normalized EBITDA margins that we have laid out today. Our hallways radiate with the energy of tenure and new talent, and we have retrofitted many platforms and products at the company with new and exciting technologies. I am confident that our work has materially improved the fundamentals of the company, and the entire management team is determined to drive shareholder value. With that, here's Mark. Mark McCaffrey : Thanks, Aman. The product enhancements over the last few years have put GoDaddy at the forefront of one of our most exciting eras yet. And we are poised to deliver a complete integrated software solution to our customers spanning every facet of their needs. We have seen the positive traction from these efforts in terms of faster product attach, stable retention rates as well as the strong sustained double-digit growth of our applications and commerce revenue, which has also contributed to us expanding our normalized EBITDA margin ahead of schedule. Moving to our financial results for the quarter. Applications and commerce grew 11% to $363 million, delivering at the high end of our guided range. Additionally, we delivered an expanded segment EBITDA margin of 42% from 41% last quarter. The related ARR for applications and commerce grew 11% to more than $1.4 billion. Create and grow ARR grew 9% to $478 million as bookings trended ahead of revenue growth. Like last quarter, GPV continues to grow at an impressive rate as our customers within our 21 million base convert to GoDaddy Payments. Core platform revenue totaled $706 million, flat year-over-year and in line with our guide. The segment's EBITDA margin accelerated to 30% from 27% last quarter. ARR for our core platform segment was $2.3 billion, flat year-over-year. Core platform revenue was supported by 4% growth in domains on stronger customer additions from higher demand and price increases. Additionally, domains bookings growth accelerated to 8%, showing a strong recovery for future revenue growth. This was partially offset by aftermarket, down slightly 2% to $107 million as it begins to reverse prior quarter trends, and the 150 basis points of headwind from migration and divestitures of certain assets previously mentioned. Total revenue grew to $1.07 billion, up 4% on a reported and constant currency basis and above the midpoint of our guide. Within total revenue, international revenue grew to $346 million, up 4% on a reported basis and 5% on a constant currency basis. ARPU grew 2% to $200 on a trailing 12-month basis, and we added 100,000 net new high-quality customers despite the headwinds from our migration efforts. We are happy to share that the number of customers with two or more products now sits above 50%, and retention rates for the GoDaddy products remained at approximately 85%. Bookings totaled $1.1 billion, growing 5% on a reported basis and 4% on a constant currency basis. Excluding the impact of aftermarket, the drivers of growth in bookings were strong customer additions and price increases in domains as well as strong attachment applications in commerce. We expect these factors to contribute to accelerated revenue and normalized EBITDA growth next year. Normalized EBITDA grew 13% to $296 million while delivering an expanded margin of 28%. These margin gains were driven in part by the two points of leverage achieved this quarter from a reduction in normalized tech and dev spend, decreasing 140 basis points sequentially as a percent of revenue. With that, we want to shed some further light on the components of tech and dev to give you an appreciation of the nature of the spend categories. There are two distinct categories of spending, one that drives product innovation and the other that supports our operations. First, we invest in driving innovation that enables our customers' success by providing competitive tools and interactions to enhance customer lifetime value through improved attach, retention and pricing. In the second category, we invest in our infrastructure to support our operations by maintaining, unifying and securing our technology platform, delivering a seamless experience for our 21 million customer. In addition, these investments facilitate a better cash profile by reducing data center-related capital expenditures, which improves our overall free cash flow and free cash flow per share. We also benefit from technologies we build in-house that are driving efficiencies in care and marketing spend. As a percentage of revenue, product innovation represents 7% to 8%, and infrastructure to run a secured company of our size represents 8% to 9%. Overall, during the third quarter, we reduced our tech and dev and capital spending by 5% from our restructuring efforts, the migration of noncore hosting assets and reduced data center capital expenditures. And to be clear, we know there is room to do more. We believe the strength of our product portfolio today has brought us to an inflection point, and we expect reduced tech and dev spending to meaningfully contribute to our EBITDA margin trajectory going forward without sacrificing GoDaddy's ability to innovate and compete. Moving on to our cash generation. Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter grew 8% to $320 million, and free cash flow grew to 6% to $280 million despite increased interest expense and the timing of working capital spend, which is expected to flip in Q4 of this year. Although our net debt has remained the same at $3.6 billion, our net cash interest expense for the quarter increased by 28% to $40 million, primarily from the refinance of our Term B loan. We finished Q3 with $329 million in cash, total liquidity of $1.3 billion, and we remain at the midpoint of our targeted leverage range of 2x to 4x. Free cash flow per share rose to $6.82 on a trailing 12-month basis versus the prior year's cash flow per share of $5.96, a 14% increase driven by improved operating leverage and share repurchases. Through October 31, we repurchased 17.3 million shares year-to-date, totaling $1.3 billion, of which $118 million was repurchased since the end of Q3. This brings the cumulative shares repurchased under our current authorization to $2.6 billion and 34.2 million shares, achieving 20% reduced fully diluted shares outstanding since the inception of these authorizations. Moving on to our outlook. We are targeting Q4 total revenue in the range of $1.095 billion to $1.115 billion, representing growth of 6% at the midpoint of our range. We expect our high-margin applications in commerce segment to deliver approximately 13% growth for Q4. In core platform segment, we expect revenue to deliver in the range of 2% to 3% growth in the fourth quarter. Bookings growth is expected to outperform revenue growth by approximately 200 basis points in Q4. As Aman mentioned, all of us on the GoDaddy team have the same determination and resolve around the opportunities we see ahead. And we are poised to drive additional normalized EBITDA margin leverage through the end of this year and beyond. As a result, we are increasing our targets for Q4 normalized EBITDA margin to approximately 29%. Additionally, the full year normalized EBITDA margin is expected to improve, delivering slightly above the 26% previously noted. As a reminder, from 2022, we delivered approximately three points of normalized EBITDA margin expansion. As evidenced by the incremental restructuring charge recognized this quarter, we remain committed to seeking out additional opportunities to drive efficiency throughout our operating model to achieve higher margins. We also remain on track to deliver our unlevered free cash flow, free cash flow and free cash flow per share target of $1.2 billion plus, $1 billion plus and $7.25 plus, respectively. In addition to our typical fourth quarter guidance, given the degree of focus on our ability to deliver margin expansion as we reaccelerate growth, we think it is important to update investors on our margin expectations for 2024. In 2024, we expect our tech and dev expenses to fall in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue year-over-year. We also expect to continue to drive improvements through the next year, resulting in a normalized EBITDA margin in Q4 of 2024 of approximately 31%. Based on our confidence in GoDaddy's ability to accelerate the pace of margin expansion in 2024, we also plan to enhance profitability further in 2025 and 2026 as we continue the path above 31% normalized EBITDA margins that we have laid out today. We will provide more detail about our expectations for this at our Investor Day in the first quarter of next year. As always, we remain focused on executing on what is within our control. So while we continue to be excited about our product portfolio, our ability to drive durable revenue growth and our levers to drive margin expansion, we realized that we are still in a dynamic macro environment, and we want to be responsive to the feedback from investors. I want to be clear that as we've been doing for the last several years, we are committed to actively managing the business with the goal of delivering a strong combination of revenue growth plus profitability. We take a dynamic approach to managing the business, and we will be proactive in driving margin expansion over time and compounding free cash flow per share. Please note that we plan to provide complete 2024 financial guidance when we report our fourth quarter results in keeping with our normal practice. We believe enhancing profitability and durable top line growth will drive even stronger free cash flow generation. We will continue to deploy cash in line with our capital allocation framework, creating significant value for our shareholders. We are excited about our path ahead, and we are acting with urgency to drive results every day. With that, we will have Christie Masoner from our Investor Relations team, open the call for questions. A - Christie Masoner : Thanks, Mark. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Vikram Kesavabhotla from Baird. Vikram, please go ahead. Vikram Kesavabhotla : Can you hear me okay? Christie Masoner : We can. Aman Bhutani : Hey, Vikram. Vikram Kesavabhotla : Thanks for taking the questions. My first one is on the guidance. I think you previously talked about exiting the year at a 7% revenue growth rate. It looks like the fourth quarter guidance here points to about 6% at the midpoint. And I think you also lowered the top end of the full year revenue range by a little bit. And so curious if you can just talk about some of the factors that are driving those adjustments? And then as a follow-up to that, I think you previously talked about an accelerating growth rate into fiscal '24. I'm curious just given all the updates here. Is that still your expectation? And I know you don't want to formally guide to '24 at this point, but maybe if you can talk about some of the puts and takes we should be taking into consideration. And I'll leave it there. Mark McCaffrey : Yes. Thanks, Vikram. I'll start with, as we've done in prior quarters, we use a range, and that range takes into account the unpredictability of our aftermarket business. And we try to build that into our thought process as we go quarter-to-quarter. 7% is still part of the guided range. It allows for the upside or downside to our transactional business. When we're talking about the difference between these numbers, we are talking about a few million dollars either direction. And overall, on a $4 billion business, we feel good about the momentum it is driving. So hopefully, that gives a little bit of help on the first part of that question. On the second part of the question, we love our momentum going into 2024. If you look at our bookings growth and applications and commerce outpacing our revenue within the quarter. If you look at domains, 8% bookings growth versus 4% revenue coming out of the quarter and going into Q4. You look at the pricing actions, we take the overall growth of applications and commerce just as a bigger part of the picture. It really shows a lot of that momentum going forward. We have a lot of confidence in that, I would say, momentum going into 2024 and our ability to grow upon that. But we're feeling good about where we're headed. Vikram Kesavabhotla : Okay, thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Trevor Young from Barclays. Trevor, please go ahead. Trevor Young : Great. Thanks. First, Mark, just sticking with that commentary around the domains booking growing 8%, nice acceleration there. Can you break down what the contribution there is from price versus actual growth in domains? And then, Aman, you mentioned getting some leverage in care over time from changing consumer behavior. What did you mean by that specifically? And then as part of the automation process that you see there, do you see opportunity to further reduce headcount either with -- in terms of in-house headcount or your contractor partners within care specifically? Mark McCaffrey : All right. Thanks, Robert. And I'll start with the domains. And I would say both, right? We took pricing actions in Q3 that started to show up, especially in our bookings, but is accelerating our revenue, but we are seeing strong demand within domain. Now the strong demand also has a compounding effect because we're seeing them attached to that second product faster than we ever did, and that is showing up in our growth in bookings and applications and commerce right now. So I'd say it's a combination of all those working in the same direction, giving that momentum and giving us that confidence going into 2024. Aman Bhutani : And on care, Trevor, over the last couple of years, we've done a good job of leveraging our care line item as revenue has grown. We've kept care pretty flat to down. When we look forward, I continue to see opportunities for automation, and the consumer behavior piece that's really important is that more and more consumers want to engage with care using chat or messaging. And that just is a lower cost interaction for us versus voice calls. We've also optimized how we connect with customers around the world, and that is continuing to be a tailwind for us because in our case, chat or messaging is running well ahead of voice. And that slowly starts to tip in favor of a lower and lower cost on the care side. Trevor Young : Great. Thank you both. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from Evercore ISI. Mark, please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, there. This is actually Jian [ph] for Mark. Thanks for taking the question. So a couple of ones. First, on the margin guidance again for '24. You mentioned kind of kind of greater leverage from tech and dev. How should we -- I guess -- maybe first, like where is the additional leverage coming from? Like what are you cutting? And how should we think about maybe a steady-state tech and dev level? And then the second question is on -- I think you mentioned very quickly on accelerating revenue in '24 as well. If you kind of talk through the puts and takes on that. What should we think about -- like how much of that is from easy comps versus your confidence in organic growth? [Indiscernible]. Mark McCaffrey : Great. Thanks, Jian, and good talking to you. On the normalized EBITDA puts and takes. We're coming -- we started talking about this in the first half of the year, and we were taking actions around integrating some of our core GoDaddy platforms into one technology stack. We took some restructuring actions. We talked about how the benefit of those would start to show up in the second half of the year. We saw some of that accelerate into Q3 based on our, I would say, hitting the timetables and milestones around getting workloads into the cloud. So we can see that momentum continuing going the year, allowing us to drive a lot of efficiencies within our tech and dev. The other part of it is application of commerce. From a segment margin perspective, as that continues to grow at an accelerated pace, that provides us even more leverage into our normalized EBITDA margin. So we'll get to a little bit more of the puts and takes and run rate and what we think is normalized when we get into next year and talk in more detail around 2024. But that's a high-level good way to think about where we're going to continue to see them and our ability to drive that leverage in our normalized EBITDA margin. Aman Bhutani : And then I think the second part of the question was around growth in 2024. And of course, there are some comps at play here, Jian. But the key piece that we're highlighting today is the growth in applications and commerce. And a couple of the data points, and I know our investors are interested in our path to growth in A&C. So we shared a couple of data points today in terms of the 12% bookings growth in Application & Commerce in Q3 and actually shared the data point for October as well with applications and commerce to mid-teens. And all of the components of applications and commerce -- and as you're probably aware, we have three core components, productivity, presence and commerce, and all of those are growing at healthy rates, which is what is pushing us into the teens there. And we expect that to continue into next year as well. Hello? Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau from William Blair. Matt, please go ahead. Matthew Pfau : Hey, great. Thanks. Just wanted to follow-up on the acceleration that you're seeing in your applications and commerce bookings. Maybe just some more details on what exactly is driving that because there are other businesses that serve SMBs that are seeing pressure with SMB spending, but it seems like you're seeing improvements. So trying to figure out what the disconnect is there? Thanks. Aman Bhutani : Yes. So when we look at our customers and we survey our customers sort of every six months or so, what we noticed is that they're resilient group. And even though they may have sort of greater negativity about the overall economy, they are much more positive about their business and bringing everything to the table. And the way they look at our products, whether it's domains or websites or the productivity solutions, specifically e-mail, as sort of low-cost offerings that create a lot of value for them. So there's a lot of consumer surplus for them in the offerings that we bring to them. And the thing that's driving our sort of faster growth in applications is commerce. Number one, as I talked about in my prepared remarks, we've unlocked some new bundling capabilities for both domains and productivity, and that's creating some new bundles, which are being accepted really well by customers. So we're super excited about that. And then in the presence bucket, I talked a little bit about our investments in Managed WordPress over the last couple of years, and that product has really come a long way and is now competitive with the best in the world. And we're seeing fast bookings growth on that double-digit bookings growth. And once we have the bookings in that, we know it's going to transition to revenue, and that's going to help accelerate Q4 and 2024 as well. And the third piece of application and commerce is commerce. And as Mark noted and I noted, GPV is still on track to double year-over-year. Our customers in our base are adopting that, and commerce continues to grow quite well. So you've got kind of all three parts of the segment really firing, and that's leading to the accelerating growth. Mark McCaffrey : And I'll just add, the strong demand we're seeing really has been at a higher level than we've seen and consistent level. We've talked about it in prior quarters. We're continuing to see that same demand. And the customers are coming in with higher intent. So they're getting to that second product to get into their third product a lot quicker. So from a micro business perspective, we're seeing a lot of demand and attachment that is really pushing our model that we've talked about in the past. Matthew Pfau : Great, thank you. Appreciate for taking my questions. Mark McCaffrey : No problem, thanks Matt. Christie Masoner : Our next question is from the line of Chris Kuntarich from UBS. Chris, please go ahead. Christopher Kuntarich : Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Maybe two, if I can. Just going back to that comment on 50% of customers now have two-plus products. I guess how should we be thinking about that versus last year and maybe versus kind of pre-COVID and really kind of how we should be thinking about where that goes in '24 and '25. Should we be thinking about more like that number jumping to 75%? Or is it more the idea that 50% of customers are going to three products? Just curious on kind of how that attach scales over time. Mark McCaffrey : Yes. And thanks, Chris. Good question, right? We've never talked about that in the past. So it's the first time we're bringing that number out, and I don't want to go back because again, it's something we're tracking a little bit more closely now. But for us, when we get to that second product it really drives not only more efficiency within our operating model and drive our margins to a higher place. It really gets into strengthening our retention rates. It really gets into driving our ARPU. So there's a lot of metrics that are driven off that second attach, and even more, they get driven off those third attached. I always say, our average is around 85% retention. But when that customer gets to that second product, it goes up significantly higher from there. And if it gets to a third product, it's almost a customer for life, right? So it's really all about driving an LTV. We'll continue to provide guidance on that as we go forward as to how we're tracking towards them in a general basis, but it comes back to the what we're seeing now is not only strong demand but strong attach and more intent to do something with the domain name to the second product than we've seen before. And I know, Aman, you're excited about some of the bundling capabilities here, too. Aman Bhutani : Yes, a couple of things I'd love to mention quickly is the first the bundling capabilities I talked about today. They're really going to help move the two-plus products number. And I think we've shared this number with you, and I think you're going to see it grow nicely. But the second thing, that's not the only thing we have in play. One of the great opportunities for GoDaddy is that we have a lot of customers coming through the domains funnel. And a lot of them aren't fully aware of the full suite of products that GoDaddy has. And that's where we're launching GoDaddy Airo, which is when a customer buys a domain name, they get a basic website created for them using gen AI and automation. They get a set of social posts that they can use right away. They get an AI-generated logo that they can use right away and actually a few other things that just come to them with the domain name. And one of the things we're most excited about launching this capability is that it will explore our domain customers to the full suite of offering that we have for them, and it will really propel two-plus products, which then leads to the numbers Mark is talking about, the higher LTV that comes with it. And that's obviously a path that we're pressing on pretty hard. Christopher Kuntarich : Got it. Very helpful. And maybe just one quick follow-up. I didn't see a GMV number in the release. Just curious. I think that's been growing two for the last two quarters. Just curious what that GMV number was and just kind of how you guys are seeing strength of overall consumer and SMB. Aman Bhutani : Yes. The GMV number continues to grow and is about 36 billion right now. So I think it will be in our 10-K. It should be there. Christopher Kuntarich : Okay, got it. Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Brent, please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : This is John for Brent Thill. Thanks. Just wanted to go back at a higher level in terms of macro. Obviously, someone else has asked as well in terms of the small business and the consumer health. But just wanted to see what you're seeing there. I don't know if there's any notable trend throughout the quarter by month and what you're seeing so far this quarter? And then second, in the ARR growth numbers that you mentioned, create and grow was 9% [indiscernible] I'm wondering. Does that mean productivity or commerce maybe is growing noticeably faster? Just want to see what those components are? Thank you. Aman Bhutani : Yes, John, let me take the first part. Mark can take the second. Based on our surveys, what we see for the micro businesses -- and I can give you two data points, one for the U.S. and one for the U.K. So you can get some idea of how it's different in different parts of the world. Generally, the question of how positive are they about growing their own business is this year a little bit up to flattish, right? They feel optimistic -- I think part of it is they have to feel optimistic. They have to show up every day and make it happen. So they have that positivity about themselves and their businesses. But if we look year-over-year on how they feel about the broader economy, that has gone down. So just to summarize in the U.S., positive on the overall economy, but almost equally positive, if not a bit higher on their own business. And it's a little bit different in the U.K. where the overall number for positivity is a bit lower. And even though they continue to be positive about their business, their view of the economy has declined much faster. So there's some consistency across the markets, but the numbers are different with the U.S. micro business owners feeling generally more positive about their business than the U.K., for example. Hopefully, that make it a bit of color, John and it's helpful. And I'll turn it to Mark. Mark McCaffrey : Yes, thanks. And I think when you look at the difference between the create and grow ARR and the overall ARR, the subscription business is productivity. So it doesn't take much of a, I would say, a lead to say, yes, it is growing at a good pace on an ARR basis and adding to our subscription. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Naved Khan from B. Riley. Naved, please go ahead. Naved Khan : Hi, thanks. Can you hear me okay? Aman Bhutani : Yes, hi Naved. Naved Khan : So just on your last answer, Mark, on the sort of the 9% growth in create and grow. I'm wondering how fast website plus marketing is growing in terms of ARR. Any color or commentary there? And then, Aman, maybe you can give us some color on payable domains, how that grew in the quarter and your thoughts there? Mark McCaffrey : We don't break it down by product specifically, but I will add color to say we're seeing strength across the board in not only create and grow but applications and commerce. So I would say we're really happy with the attach, the momentum in the market. The A&C bookings are really outpacing revenue at this point. So I would say strength across the board. Aman Bhutani : Yes. And on payable domain, we continued to perform and contribute to the GPV growth that we're seeing, but in line sort of with what we've seen in the past. Q3 overall was a stronger quarter for GPV. And as we look forward to Q4, we're excited to see what's to come. Naved Khan : Thank you guys. Aman Bhutani : Thank you, Naved. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Ella Smith from JPMorgan. Ella, please go ahead. Ella Smith : Hi, team. Thanks for taking my question. Aman and Mark, could you please update us on the hosting business? If domains were up 4% in the quarter, does that imply that hosting was down high single digits in the quarter? Mark McCaffrey : We're seeing about 150 basis points of headwind related to the hosting business and the divestitures and the migration. Aftermarket is also included in the core platform number, just to keep in mind. While we're going to have some headwinds related to some of those actions we took in the first half of the year, we're seeing the core GoDaddy hosting platform stable, right? We're seeing high retention rates. We're seeing a lot of cash flow generation. We're even seeing that the few little churn that we have within the core GoDaddy hosting stack is going to other areas of our platform right now and attaching products. So I would say we're continuing to work through the integration, divestitures, the compares around it. We'll have some headwinds moving into next year related to that part of it, but we're happy with GoDaddy's core hosting strength right now being stable and primarily close to flat. Ella Smith : Got it. Makes sense. And for my follow-up, I think Aman just said that GMV was 38 billion in the quarter. What about GPV? And I was hoping you can remind us around your strategy to refer customers to GoDaddy Payments. Aman Bhutani : Yes. I had said 36 billion. And GPV is on track, very similar to last quarter to double year-over-year. There's no change in sort of the trajectory there. Like I just noted, it was actually a strong quarter for GPV, and we're looking forward to Q4. In terms of attaching GoDaddy Payments to our base, new -- or let me handle both new customers coming in, for example, the websites plus marketing attaching GoDaddy Payments at very, very high rates and us attaching to the base has continued to grow. And the biggest contributor to the GPV growth continues to be us converting existing GoDaddy customers to GoDaddy Omnicommerce solution. Ella Smith : Great. Thank you so much. Aman Bhutani : Thanks, Ella. Mark McCaffrey : Thanks, Ella. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Ygal Arounian from Citi. Ygal, please go ahead. Ygal Arounian : Hey, good afternoon guys. First question, so you've had an activist investor get a little bit more active and vocal about their views and just want to maybe get -- give you an opportunity to respond or make any comments on that or anything you'd like to share. And then second, you mentioned strength in domains, including pricing. So is that on the pricing front? Is it raising the annual price for domain registrations? And with the strength you're seeing in domains, relative to what we're seeing in terms of dot-com and dot-net growth, which has been challenged and kind of flat, what are you seeing? What are the differences? Is it growth in different TLDs? Is it more -- especially the ones that you hold at your registry business, too? Maybe just a little bit of insight on what you're seeing in the domain world. Aman Bhutani : Thanks, Ygal. We talk to our investors regularly, and what we learned is that they're looking for more information from us in a couple of areas. They're looking for our plan to drive further margin expansion, and they're looking for our path to faster growth in A&C. And what you saw in our prepared comments today is that we shared more details on both of those areas. We as a team are focused on the results we're delivering, and all of our forward commentary is everything that we're doing to drive value for shareholders. So our broader view is that we listen to a lot of -- we're engaged with our investors all the time. We're listening to them, and we're sharing back information on the things that we feel they're asking us for. And then on the domain side, I'll turn it to Mark, but just to quickly remind you, although we don't break out dot-com, dot-net or any specific TLD, our registry business continues to do well. It's continued to sort of perform at a great rate. And we do offer, as you know, a very large number, TLDs over 400. So our business, our base is different. And also our reach internationally is significantly different than many other players. But I'll turn it to Mark to see what he'd add. Mark McCaffrey : I think that covered a lot of it, Aman. I would say we're seeing strength in the demand end of it. We're seeing -- we took pricing action. No doubt that's contributing to the overall 8% bookings growth that we're seeing in domains coming out of the quarter. So a lot of strength there. We're a little different than some of the other players. So we have a little bit more breadth of what we offer, and we're seeing strength in some TLDs. And probably our geographic regions, as others have pointed out, there are weaknesses in certain areas that we're just not as exposed to. Ygal Arounian : Great, thanks. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Wong from Oppenheimer. Ken, please go ahead. Ken Wong : Hi, can you guys hear me? Christie Masoner : We can. Mark McCaffrey : We can. Ken Wong : Great. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to maybe check in if you guys can give an update on what you're seeing in the aftermarket. What are the dynamics that played out in the quarter? And how we're thinking about that trend in Q4? Mark McCaffrey : Yes. So we tried to add a little more color around the aftermarket and our stated comments this time. We continue to be the global leader in the aftermarket, and it's driving part of a healthy domain business overall. It's a $400 million-plus business, and we're seeing it grow at a lesser rate than we've seen before. Now Q3 was still a relatively tough compare to last year for us in that. So we've seen less of a dip. We see that trend starting to turn like we talked about. We expect Q4 to be an easier compare. And obviously, we expect going into 2024, those comparisons get broadly more easy. But from a volume perspective, overall, we're still seeing a healthy $400 million-plus business on an annual basis. We continue to see the momentum. Like we stated earlier, in the year, we're not seeing the large transactions like we used to, but we continue to see on a volume basis aftermarket being healthy. Ken Wong : Got it. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on the kind of spend management, I think definitely positive development, see some focus there. I guess what's the -- what areas are you looking to potentially peel back on from R&D? Any concerns that, that might potentially hurt product innovation? Aman Bhutani : Yes. Thanks for that question. When we look at our tech and debt spend, the way we have it allocated is the -- it's divided between the platform investments and our product innovation. On the platform side, there is a set of investment made, which Mark shared with some slides around cyber, around core data platform improvements, and those have tended to help all our products. And what we found there is as we integrate more and more platforms, as we've integrated the brands that we talked about this year, some of those costs peak and it started to come down. So we're seeing leverage on the platform side, and that's great. On the product innovation side, our approach has very much been about attacking a few areas and driving improvement in them. And as those areas improve, shifting our spend into other areas -- or our investment, I should say, into other areas and improving them. And we're very careful about how those investments. And as an example, we invested -- and I talked about the investment in Managed WordPress over a couple of years. And I'm very happy to have a great product today that is now showing great growth as well. But that does mean that we have team and a size of investment there that we no longer need to continue to invest in it. So hopefully, that gives you a bit of color on how we go about sort of getting leverage on the whole on the platform side but also on the core product side, where we are able to move people around and get to things and sort of drive growth without necessarily always adding more. Ken Wong : Got it. Appreciate the insights. Thank you very much. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Deepak Mathivanan from Wolfe. Deepak, please go ahead. Deepak Mathivanan : Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just wanted to ask about the headwinds from the hosting business, from all the divestitures and some of the other moving pieces. When should we expect some of this to normalize? And what do you generally think kind of the long-term growth outlook for these businesses? And then sort of I wanted to follow-up on the answer for the question below. How much is the margin expansion targets for potentially '24 and then '25 and '26 and beyond? Sort of dependent on the top line growth. Are there any specific ranges that you can kind of give us to expect on the top line side to achieve this margin targets? Thanks so much. Mark McCaffrey : Yes. Thanks, Deepak. I'll start with the divestitures and the headwinds related to it. A lot of those activities we've completed in the first half of the year. So it will be a little bit of time before the comparables around them start to normalize. They will take to the second half of next year. So it will create a little bit of a headwind going into the year for us. We do have some of those activities still happening in the second half of the year. So it will continue to be something we will point out, call out and talk about the impact. That's why we called out the 150 basis point headwinds related to that going forward. From a stabilization point of view, once we get through the actions that we've taken when you look at the core GoDaddy platform in and of itself, we think this is going to be a low single digit to flat growing business over time. It's got huge high retention rates compared to our normal business, generates a lot of cash flow. And we're seeing them convert over to other areas of the GoDaddy platform when they leave. So they're staying within the technology stack, which is great for us. But we're not looking at that as driving any significant growth in our core platform going forward. So hopefully, that's helpful. On the margin expansion, our model doesn't require double-digit growth going forward. We acknowledge we're living in a dynamic environment and the headwinds in their sales wins are continuing to present themselves. But if you look at the momentum around our A&C business in and of itself, its ability to generate higher normalized EBITDA becoming a bigger part of the picture as we move forward. If you look at our demand, our retention rates, our APRU all of those are pointing to more efficient and our ability to drive that operating margin. That's why we're comfortable and confident about the 31% exit rate and being approximately there when we exit next year. That's why we're confident in saying we're going to grow from there going into '25 and '26 as well. So again, takeaway, not premised on double-digit growth and is looking to continue to expand as we get away from the actions we've taken. We grow A&C. We're on the same technology stack now. And we're seeing the momentum in the business that we think is really going to drive profitable growth moving forward. Aman Bhutani : Yes. And just very quickly, I did mention in my prepared remarks some of the areas where we have initiatives to continue to drive more efficiency in the line items, and I want to repeat them again, but we did share some items there. And ultimately, it drives a better combination of growth and profitability. Christie Masoner : Great. Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session. I'll turn it back over to Aman for some closing remarks. Aman Bhutani : Thank you, Christie, and thank you for joining us. As always, just a quick mention to all the GoDaddy employees who have been working super hard and a great quarter for us. And I'm excited looking forward into Q4 and 2024. Thank you.",

And except to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to update these statements because of new information or future events. With that, I'm pleased to introduce Aman. Aman Bhutani : Good afternoon, and thank you all for joining us today. At GoDaddy, our mission is to empower entrepreneurs and make opportunity more inclusive for all. Our strategy centers on creating customer value, driving profitable growth resulting in compounding free cash flow per share and long-term shareholder value. Our focus remains on margin expansion and growth in our Applications and Commerce segment. 2023 was a pivotal year for us and I am pleased with our financial and operational results. Innovation accelerated as we brought together our technology capabilities into a unified technology stack, enabling us to launch our compelling GoDaddy Airo experience. We also drove 2023 normalized EBITDA margin ahead of our guidance as we balanced investment in growth and cost structure management. Full year normalized EBITDA margin increased approximately 200 basis points, resulting in a 12% increase in free cash flow and a 21% increase in free cash flow per share. In Q4, we drove 16% bookings growth for our high margin segment, Applications and Commerce segment and this momentum continued into January. Our focus on the combination of optimizing costs and driving growth in Applications and Commerce, has positioned our business well to exit 2024 with a normalized EBITDA margin of approximately 31%. At the Investor Day in November, we showcased how GoDaddy Airo delivers a seamless experience for identity and presence and our teams have launched even more capabilities since then. At our upcoming Investor Day on March 6, we will showcase these new capabilities as well as provide a sneak peek into what is coming soon. Airo enablement of Commerce features will also be showcased, which now expands the Airo experience across the entire entrepreneur\u2019s wheel, fully unlocking the full power of GoDaddy\u2019s software platform for our customers in a seamless and intuitive manner. Over the last few quarters, we covered our continued efforts to optimize our marketing spend and G&A expenses. We have had similar efforts in technology and development and care as well. In technology and development, the simplification and unification of our technology stack led to a material reduction in our server footprint and multiple areas of costs associated with it. We also expanded our access to talent globally and together, these items benefited both our capital and operating expenses. In care, we are harvesting the benefits of our investments in technology and global scale as customer preferences shifted towards asynchronous chat, and with continued room for leverage through the automation of tasks and the rollout of GoDaddy Airo for our care guides. Additionally, the power of data from our GoDaddy software platform bolsters our ability to drive faster decision-making and is expected to benefit both our margin and revenue opportunities. We are excited to share more about continued leverage opportunities driven by innovation in technology and care at our Investor Day in Tempe. As always, I would like to cover our high priority initiatives, but I will keep my comments here brief since we plan to share an expanded set of demos in March. To start, bundling has been a key focus for us as a part of our innovation in domains and productivity to drive attach. This initiative primarily benefits our high margin Applications and Commerce segment, and we expect our Airo experience to drive this higher over time. Airo has also created new engagement surfaces allowing us to deliver automated customer experiences that we will continue to improve over time. On GoDaddy Airo, I have an update on its performance since launch. I am happy to share that in a controlled experiment, customers that were part of the first test cohort for the Airo experience monetized at rates higher than those customers in the control group that were not exposed to the Airo experience. The increased monetization was due to attach and shifting the mix towards higher price and higher margin products. This is particularly encouraging because significant customer experience changes like Airo typically take many months of iterative improvement to outperform the control group. With this initial promising result, we have rolled out GoDaddy Airo to more customers in the U.S. We have also launched tests in international markets a few days ago. Our goal for Airo is to help more customers discover more products and engage with them at higher rates, leading to even greater monetization opportunities. As a result, we are closely monitoring cohort performance across discovery, engagement and monetization. Components of the GoDaddy Airo experience are also currently being tested in our Managed WordPress and hub experiences, creating opportunities to save our designers and developers time and effort. We are also testing the Airo experience in care so guides can support our customers better and faster. Our platform approach to GoDaddy Airo means that new capabilities are quickly coming to market. For example, we will test Airo Commerce functionality in the first half of this year, and these capabilities will extend to our partnerships as well. On Commerce, over the last year we proved that we can sell our payments solutions into our customer base, and it was the largest driver of GPV growth last year. In fact, annualized GPV for 2023 exceeded our expectations and grew a 125% year-over-year. As we enter 2024, we are looking forward to surfacing our Commerce capabilities more seamlessly with our Airo experience and doubling down on selling the full omni-commerce solution, driving higher margin subscription revenue. This is the last of a series of proof points that set up the Commerce business for the long term, which is aligned with our overall strategy of creating customer value that ultimately drives profitable growth. As Commerce subscription revenue takes center stage and GPV growth takes lower priority, we still expect to continue to scale our base of Commerce customers by growing GPV at healthy double-digits. In closing, as I look ahead at the rest of 2024, I am excited by our ability to drive margin improvement and growth in Applications and Commerce, which we expect together will result in impressive improvements in free cash flow per share. Behind these improving metrics is a talented workforce that is committed to ongoing innovation. For example, every week we launch new tests, methodically track results, and share results broadly across the organization, making us better every day. The operational discipline of compounding improvements and doubling down on proof points continues to crystallize our path forward and raise our confidence to achieve our targets. With that, here's Mark. Mark McCaffrey : Thanks Aman. Hello everyone and thank you all for joining us. In 2023, we made significant strides in our ability to deliver a unified GoDaddy software platform for our customers. These efforts are reflected in our results that drove sustained double-digit growth of our Applications and Commerce revenue of 13% in the quarter, expansion of our Q4 normalized EBITDA margin above our target, delivering 29.5% and free cash flow per share above our target delivering $7.50 for the full year. Beginning with Q4 results, our high margin Applications and Commerce revenue grew 13% to $377 million and we delivered an expanded segment EBITDA margin of 44%, increasing 100 basis points since last quarter and 300 basis points since last year. ARR for Applications and Commerce grew 10% to $1.4 billion and our Create + Grow ARR was up 8% to $481 million. In Commerce, we drove significant growth in annualized GPV to $1.7 billion, more than doubling last year\u2019s performance as conversion of our existing customers to the GoDaddy software platform remains strong. Core Platform revenue grew 2% to $723 million in the fourth quarter and segment EBITDA margin grew to 32%, increasing 200 basis points since last quarter and 250 basis points since last year. ARR for Core Platform was $2.3 billion consistent with prior year. Growth in Core Platform during the fourth quarter was supported by domain's growth of 4%, a continued strong demand and price increases. Bookings growth in domains was 7%, providing a positive leading indicator for future domain revenue. In addition, aftermarket grew 14% to $118 million on increasing volume and easier comps. As a reminder, while aftermarket is stable on an annual basis, it is more difficult to predict quarter-to-quarter compared to our other businesses due to its transactional nature and that it relies on third-party sellers and buyers to determine a mutually acceptable price. Our gains in Core Platform were partially offset by an 11% decrease in hosting, as we continue our efforts to integrate GoDaddy\u2019s software platform. Bifurcating the hosting business, the continuing GoDaddy hosting revenue remains a stable, strong cash generator with high retention. The remainder of the portfolio decreased over the past several years and we have taken deliberate steps throughout 2023 to rationalize the business. We will continue to evaluate the components of this business, integrating platforms that are strategic and rationalizing platforms that are not accretive to our long-term financial model. Total revenue in Q4 topped $1.1 billion, growing 6% on a reported and constant currency basis. International revenue grew 4% on a reported and constant currency basis to $354 million. As a reminder, our migrations and our divestitures are primarily impacting international regions. Q4 bookings grew to $1.1 billion, up 7% or 6% on a constant currency basis. Applications and Commerce bookings grew 16% on strong attach of productivity solutions and continued strength in our Create + Grow products. Core Platform bookings increased 3% due to the strong fourth quarter performance in domains, offset by migration and divestiture headwinds in hosting. Subscription bookings grew 200 basis points ahead of subscription revenue. Normalized EBITDA in Q4 grew 22% to $324 million, representing a 29.5% margin, and an expansion of nearly 400 basis points compared to Q4, 2022. The continued margin expansion was driven by the leverage gains we achieved in the second half of 2023 across all spend categories. As we shared last quarter, we continue to expect Q4, 2024 normalized EBITDA margin of approximately 31% with continued margin expansion in the out years, while also driving innovation, like you saw with our GoDaddy Airo experience. As we think about this seamless experience for customers, Airo is possible, thanks to the work we have done to unify our technology stack into one software platform that include ownership of the data from domain through to transactions. And this serves as an accelerant to our model as we bundle and bring more products to market faster on the platform. With that, during the fourth quarter, we reduced our combined technology and development and capital spending by 7% from our migrations, divestitures and restructuring efforts throughout 2023, as well as from reduced data center capital expenditures. We expect that our technology and development spend will continue to decline in absolute dollars in 2024 compared to 2023, as most of this work was completed in 2023. Moving onto cash generation. Unlevered free cash flow grew 46% to $347 million, while free cash flow grew 51% to $305 million, despite a 13% increase in cash interest expense year-over-year. Free cash flow per share increased 21% to $7.50 per share, driven by growth in Applications and Commerce, operating leverage improvements and share repurchases throughout 2023, which is partially offset by an increase in cash interest expense. Turning to the balance sheet. We exited the year with $0.5 billion in cash and short-term investments and total liquidity of $1.5 billion. Net debt landed at $3.4 billion, below three times net leverage on a trailing 12-month basis, and near the midpoint of our targeted range of 2 to 4 times. In January 2024, we refinanced $1.8 billion of outstanding principal to secure a 50 basis point interest rate reduction. This strategic adjustment along with the repricing completed in July 2023 are together expected to reduce annualized cash interest expense by approximately $22 million. Additionally, the cumulative shares repurchased under our current authorizations totaled $2.6 billion, representing 34.2 million shares retired. This reduced our fully diluted shares outstanding since the inception of these authorizations by over 20%, achieving our three-year targeted reduction ahead of schedule. Our buybacks over the last two years have driven impressive ROI for this capital outlay, demonstrating our disciplined capital allocation framework and dedication to driving long-term shareholder value. Moving onto our annual financial results. Total revenue grew 4% or 5% on a constant currency basis to $4.3 billion. ARPU grew 3% to $203 as we added 100,000 net new customers, despite the elevated churn from our ongoing platform migrations and divestitures. Customer retention remains 85% as we drove improvements in 2+ product attach, with greater than 50% of our customers paying for at least two products. These high-quality customers are stickier and give us greater pricing flexibility. Applications and Commerce revenue grew 12% to $1.4 billion and Core Platform revenue was flat, totaling $2.8 billion. International revenue grew 4% to $1.4 billion. Total bookings grew 4% or 5% on a constant currency basis to $4.6 billion. Full year normalized EBITDA grew 12% to $1.1 billion, representing a 27% margin for the year, an expansion of nearly 200 basis points over the prior year. Lastly, full year unlevered free cash flow grew 14% to $1.3 billion and free cash flow grew 12% to $1.1 billion, both exceeding our guide for the year and showing impressive normalized EBITDA to cash conversion of nearly one to one. Moving onto our outlook. For the full year, we expect total revenue to be within a range of $4.48 billion to $4.56 billion, representing growth of over 6% at the midpoint of the range. When excluding the approximate 100 basis point impact of divestitures and migrations, that we will lap in the year, our growth would be 7% at the midpoint of the range. In Application and Commerce, we are projecting revenue growth of low to mid-teens for Q1 and the full year. In Core Platform, we are projecting revenue growth of low single-digits for Q1 and the full year. As we have shared previously, the entire GoDaddy team is committed to maintaining operational discipline and deploying opportunities to gain further leverage within our model. We delivered on this commitment in 2023 and expect to continue this trend in 2024, resulting in an expected normalized EBITDA margin of approximately 29% for the full year. We are targeting unlevered free cash flow of at least $1.4 billion, free cash flow of at least $1.2 billion, and free cash flow per share of approximately $9, representing a growth rate of 20% for the full year of 2024. In 2024, we expect capital expenditures of $35 million and cash interest payments of $155 million, representing reduced spend of 11% over 2023. In addition, we expect income tax payments of approximately $30 million. On share repurchases, we expect to buy back shares under our remaining $1.4 billion authorization using our disciplined capital allocation framework that we've applied in past quarters. Capital return has been and will continue to be a priority for GoDaddy, along with prudently managing our balance sheet, as we look to drive compounding returns for our shareholders. For Q1 2024, we are targeting total revenue of $1.085 billion to $1.105 billion, representing nearly 6% growth at the midpoint of the range. As a reminder, because of the timing of certain marketing spend, such as the spend that support our heavy renewal cycle in Q1 and the spend related to our launch of GoDaddy Airo, our normalized EBITDA margin will build over the course of 2024. As a result, we expect Q1 normalized EBITDA to be 27%, representing a nearly 300 basis point expansion over Q1, 2023. Over the course of the year, normalized EBITDA margin is expected to increase to approximately 31% as we exit the year, which averages to approximately 29% for the full year. We are proud of our record of accomplishment of increasing margins on an absolute basis and compared to our own initial guidance over the last three years. Investors should continue to see this discipline moving forward. In summary, we remain dedicated to actively managing our business through a combination of durable top line growth and improving profitability. We are focused on balancing the two to drive our strong free cash flow, which, when coupled with our disciplined capital allocation framework, creates significant value for our shareholders. We see an exciting path and have strong confidence in our ability to execute against our strategic priorities. At our Investor Day on March 6th, we will demo the expanded capabilities of GoDaddy Airo and Commerce. We will also discuss long-term growth and profitability expectations and levers we will provide a clear view of our opportunities. We will share our capital allocation framework and the shareholder value it will create. We are committed to providing the information you need to understand our long-term strategy and initiatives, model the business confidently, value the business effectively, and hold us accountable for executing against our stated objectives. We'll end the day with Q&A, hosted by our management team. With that, I'll hand the call over to Christie Masoner, VP of Investor Relations, to open the call for Q&A. A - Christie Masoner : Thanks Mark. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Naved Khan from B. Riley. Naved, please go ahead. Naved Khan : Yeah. Hi. Can you hear me? Christie Masoner : We can. Aman Bhutani : We can. Naved Khan : Okay, great. So, two questions from me. One, maybe just on the big picture macro environment, just your views on where we are currently in terms of demand. And then in relation to that, where do you see or what would cause you to come in at the high-end of the range if you just gave versus at the low-end? So just kind of encapsulate that for us. And then the other question I had is around the billion-dollar in valuation allowance. I think you had a sort of a release in the valuation allowance. You already have a tax shield, which I think kind of protects you from paying taxes or meaningful amount of taxes until 2030 or 2031. Is this in addition to that? How should I think about the release? Aman Bhutani : Thanks Naved. Why don't I kick that off with a quick comment on the macro and I'll turn it to Mark for sort of the range and the valuation allowance. On the big picture, our customers continue to be the micro businesses and they're resilient crew and definitely we see strong demand continuing to come in through the front door. Of course, we continue to optimize our spend, marketing spend and be very, very judicious about finding new customers and bringing them to the site. But gross ads continue to be strong. And generally, I would say, our customers feel a little bit better about their prospects. Mark, I'll turn it to you. Mark McCaffrey : Yeah, absolutely. And thanks Naved. On the high end of the range, I mean, you're really looking at the market around, aftermarket. We have -- we've looked at it as a flat business to slightly growing single digits, but it's always subject to larger transactions, easier comps in Q4 this year. But it seems to be a flat business, but can vary in the range. Also, we have to look at the bundling efforts we're making. Airo is early stage. We're seeing customers come in the funnel. Aman said that, talked about the demand, but they're coming in and attaching that 2+ product. We're seeing a lot of momentum there. Obviously, continued momentum would be helpful. Commerce, we're seeing continued conversion of our existing customer base to our payment platform. There's always upside from pricing as we get into more value delivering in there. So, there's many different things that can put us to the high-end of the range. We like the momentum. Obviously, we call things as we see them today, and we feel really good about where we are and how that momentum is carrying forward. On the price -- on that \u2013 sorry -- on the tax, as a reminder, we paid a one-time $850 million fee in 2020 to buy the tax savings from our shareholders back in that time, right? And that was the NOLs and the credits that had built up over a period of time. For accounting reasons, that was reserved on our books and what you're seeing now because of our increased profitability and our ability to utilize that asset over what I would say a foreseeable period of time coming forward. Accounting rules require you release that when it's more likely than not you're going to get the benefit. So you saw that there. It's not cash. It doesn't affect cash, doesn't affect normalized EBITDA or anything along those lines, but it is a benefit the company will receive from taxes in the foreseeable future. So hopefully that answered your question there. Naved Khan : It does. Thanks guys. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Zach Morrissey at Wolfe Research. Zach, please go ahead. Zach Morrissey : Great. Thank you. I guess just starting with Airo, obviously, it seems -- early results are pretty encouraging, expanding the rollout. I guess, how do we think about like what are the gating factors to a more broad rollout, at least in the U.S., just based on the early results that you're seeing today. And kind of how is this embedded in the kind of 2024 outlook in terms of any kind of growth on the Application/Commerce side of things? And then on the legacy hosting, obviously, that came in a little bit weaker just based on some of the strategic decisions you guys are making. How do we think about the trajectory kind of embedded in the 2024 growth outlook for core platforms? I think comps get easier as we kind of progress through the year, but any kind of color and context would be helpful there. Aman Bhutani : Thanks Zach. On Airo, we're super excited about the Airo launch. It's not often new launch, a completely new experience and customers, who are used to a certain experience adopt it and it actually does better in the first test. So super encouraging results. We are actually rolling out Airo very, very quickly to more and more cohort of customers that starts with new customers. For example, when we first started in November, we were doing it for customers that bought a domain. Very quickly after that, we enabled it for customers that bought a domain and a website. And so, more and more Airo capabilities are showing up to more customers. We launched it in international too. Of course, the full swing is getting it to all of our new customers across the globe and then starting to penetrate the base as well, which where a ton of opportunity lies for us to be able to go to our basic customers and offer them these capabilities. So, I would say every week more customers are seeing Airo. We're actually moving as quickly as we can. I'm super happy with the team's progress. And in terms of the guidance, I'll turn it to Mark. Mark McCaffrey : Yeah. As Aman mentioned, you can hear the excitement. We're very encouraged about the momentum and the engagement metrics, but it is still early days. When we consolidated the core software platform for GoDaddy, we saw bundling and customers move into 2+ products a lot faster. And obviously Airo, we look at as an enabler of that down the road and we think it'll allow for greater bundling, greater catch, better retention. But right now it's early days and we're calling everything we see in front of us based on the momentum we see coming into the year. On the -- move on to the legacy hosting, a couple of things there, right? We have about 100 basis points of headwind coming into the year related to our divestitures and migrations that we've done. So that's built into the guide that we've given. In addition, we've seen aftermarket. We think it's going to be a flat to single digit grower, it's a $400 million plus business. We're really encouraged by the volume that's coming through the platform and the fact that it allows people to get names and in a secondary market, they couldn't get in the primary market. But we think it's going to be -- it's -- how do you say, moderated in its growth and it's leveled out. So, we've built that into the forecast. And we've talked about domains openly. We saw 4% revenue growth coming out of the quarter, but 7% bookings growth. So, we think there's a lot of momentum in the domains. And a lot of that has to do with the core GoDaddy platform now that we've launched and getting people the demand in, getting them to attach quicker, getting them to those retention rates we talk about in our model. Zach Morrissey : Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from a line of Vikram Kesavabhotla from Baird. Vik, please go ahead. Vikram Kesavabhotla : Hey, can you hear me? Christie Masoner : Yes, we can. Aman Bhutani : Hey, Vikram. Vikram Kesavabhotla : Yeah. I just wanted to follow-up first on the Applications and Commerce segment. Appreciate the color, Mark, you just provided on Airo. But I guess outside of that, curious if you could talk about what the primary drivers of growth in that segment are going to be to support the low to mid-teens range in fiscal '24. And then separately, I also wanted to ask about the share repurchases. You mentioned the plan around the remaining $1.4 billion. I guess any color you could offer in terms of the cadence of repurchases going forward. And maybe if you could also just remind us of your broader capital allocation priorities and framework going forward and leave it there. Thanks. Mark McCaffrey : Yeah. Thanks Vikram. On A&C, the growth drivers, and we talk about this a lot, is we're seeing the demand move to that second product much faster than we had ever seen. And then now we're seeing it to the third product much faster than we've ever seen. So that shows up in our A&C growth. That's our higher profitability segment as well. So, it's driving a lot of our increased profitability and leverage within our model. But those are the drivers. Outside of Airo, it is the bundling. It's the customers, customers coming in with intent, customers moving to that second product. We've talked about once we get to the second product, our average retention is 85%, but it goes up from there. If we get customers to a third product, it goes up significantly. It's almost a customer for life. So, those are the things that are driving the momentum in A&C right now, and we're seeing that compounding. So, I would say between price, demand, attach, everything is driving that nice growth in there. On the share of purchases, there's been no change. We'll talk about it a little more on Investor Day, a little more broadly, but it's still a big part of our portfolio to return capital to our shareholders. We have 1.4 left on our authorization. We'll look at it in our discipline framework, quarter to quarter, based on what we see out there, and we'll make decisions as we go. We will talk about it a little bit more when we get to the Investor Day in March. Aman Bhutani : And then maybe, Vik, just looking at it from a different lens, you asked about A&C. If you look at it as the components of the products that we sell in A&C, every part of A&C, or every significant part of A&C, is growing booking double-digits right now. Right? So that's really propelling that business and getting to that 16% bookings growth we talked about. Vikram Kesavabhotla : Okay, great. Thank you. Aman Bhutani : Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Matt Pfau from William Blair. Matt, please go ahead. Matthew Pfau : Hey, great. Thanks. Wanted to start off asking on payments, and perhaps you could just give us an idea about where you are at in terms of penetrating your existing customer base, or at least the addressable customer base. As we go into 2024, do you expect converting existing customers to be the biggest driver of growth again? Aman Bhutani : Yes, thanks, Matt. We are still in very, very early stages of penetrating our customer base. We feel very comfortable that we have access to a lot of commerce intent customers within the base already. We do expect it to continue to be the largest driver of our growth in payments in 2024 as well. So, we expect very healthy growth. As I said in my prepared comments, we are going to expand what we're selling to these customers. We're going to go after more of the omni commerce solution. We're ready. We've got some great products, some great offerings. You'll see much of it in March as well. So, we're going to go broader with our offering to these customers, but the core payments functionality, we feel really good that will keep growing well. Matthew Pfau : Great. And just to follow-up on the guidance for A&C, the bookings growth of 16% in Q4 and then guiding for low to mid-teens in Q1, what's the discrepancy there? Is there payments or something else that drives that difference? Mark McCaffrey : Thanks Matt. I would look at the overall business and the momentum we have going in. Remember, it's not just a subscription business. We have transactional and we have hardware shipments as well. So, we take that into account and we take into account the timing of those orders and when we think they're going out. So, there'll always be a little bit of a discrepancy between bookings and revenue related to that. Aman Bhutani : Yeah. Just to make sure, what we talked about is 16% is bookings, right? Revenue is always going to lag a little bit, like Mark said, and you'll see it show up, of course. Matthew Pfau : Perfect. Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Mahaney from Evercore ISI. Mark, please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. This is Jennie from Mark Mahaney. Just -- first a question on Airo again. Can you just give us more color, which international markets are you testing right now? And maybe also apart from driving product attach, what are the other potential monetization opportunities that you may be exploring for Airo? And then the second question is, you kind of mentioned greater attach gives you greater pricing flexibility. So, can you talk about ARPU? How should we think about ARPU growth drivers this year between just growing attach versus potentially taking up pricing? Like is price action baked into your full year out? Thank you. Aman Bhutani : Yeah. On the international markets, our typical rollout plan is always English, large English markets first. So those are the markets we're testing now. But our absolute view is that Airo is a capability that should go across to all our markets. And there's a long tail of great tickets for us to approach there. So super excited about that. In terms of product attach and other monetization means, of course, product attach is the first level we're looking for. But as we'll share a little bit at our Investor Day, we're also looking for new monetization methods. And I'll just give you an example. One of the things that we want to test is a premium offering for logo building. Where -- as you see in Airo, you buy a domain and Airo builds you a logo and it builds you or gives you the ability to be able to edit that logo. But there are more services that we can offer around it. And we're going to test a new paywall for it and a new monetization method that GoDaddy has never done before. So that's one example of one of the types of things our teams are testing. And then I think in terms of the second part, I'll turn it to Mark. Mark McCaffrey : Yeah. So, anything we plan on doing pricing wise, just so you know, is built into our guide as we sit here today. We're excited about the bundling and the attach that's happening within Airo, within our software platform all together. And with 21 million customers, 14 million interactions with them, we get a lot of data about how they're getting value out of our products, which creates a lot of opportunity going forward around pricing bundles, elasticity around that, seeing the value they're driving. So, we think there's a lot of opportunity out there as we go forward. But right now, we've built in pricing actions as we usually do within our guide for the rest of the year. And we'll continue to evaluate and update as we go forward. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes to the line of Clarke Jeffries at Piper Sandler. Clarke, please go ahead. Clarke Jeffries : Hello. Thank you for taking the question. Two questions for Mark. One is, you mentioned 100 basis point revenue headwind from some of those divestitures. Based off of the 7% or 8% domain bookings, it seems like there's strength there. I just wanted to ask clarification on when we'll see the revenue headwind sort of peak or trough during calendar 2024. It's 100 bps for the full year, but just any more color on intra quarter trends and then follow up. Mark McCaffrey : Yeah. Clarke, I would say it will be primarily the first half with some in the second half, but primarily in the first half. Clarke Jeffries : All right, perfect. And then for that 200 bps of EBITDA margin expansion for next year, reflecting on what happened in 2023, marketing and advertising dollars did fall. But we've had a good discussion around the intent to reduce tech and dev spend. So, when you think about the driver of that 200 bps, any way you could frame mix shift of A&C reduction in tech and dev and anything incremental around marketing advertising dollar growth or percent of revenue for calendar '24 would be great. Thank you. Mark McCaffrey : Yeah. Thanks Clarke. And the way I look at it is if you take where we're exiting at Q4 of 2023 and where we're going for Q4 of 2024, the things that you have to look at are, reduced T&D spend, right? We're leveraging more of the AWS cloud. We're reducing dependency on data centers. There'll be a natural leverage we'll get in our P&L related to that. We're getting leverage in our care organization through the use of AI and automation, also access to global workforces that'll help us as we go forward. And then some of it is just the natural growing A&C picture, right? It's a more profitable segment. It's software based. Therefore, as that grows and becomes a bigger part of the picture, it helps expand our margins just naturally again, that leverage we get from the 2+ products starts to kick in the bigger A&C gets all together. So those are kind of the levers I'm looking at. Hopefully that's helpful. Clarke Jeffries : Absolutely. Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes to the line of Ygal Arounian from Citigroup. Ygal, please go ahead. Hey, Ygal. Ygal Arounian : Hey. Good afternoon, guys. I want to focus maybe on customer growth for a second. Is there any way to help us understand the impact of customers from the hosting divestitures? And I guess even if we normalize for that, we look at what customer growth has been historically versus what it's been over the past couple of years. You talk about a continued strong top line or top of the funnel, sorry, a customer growth that around 1%, let's call it. Historically, it's been anywhere from 2% to 4%. How are you guys thinking about customer growth right now? Or are you focused on a smaller subset of customers that might convert more easily? And you're looking to ARPU to fill in the gap. Do you think we can get back to that lower single-digit versus single digit or flattish customer growth number the next year or two? Mark McCaffrey : Yeah. So I'll give some color for you, Ygal. When we look at our customers, we've always said we are targeting customers with a higher intent to do something when they come into the funnel, add that second product, start that business, generate value for themselves, and therefore generate value for us. What we've seen coming out of '23 and continuing into 2024 at the gross ads level is that consistent, strong demand that we've talked about all year and that continuing. And to put it in perspective, '23 gross customer ads was higher than 2022, right? And so not only are we seeing an increase there, we're seeing it more consistent from quarter to quarter and more stable.  With that, we're seeing that also that intentful customer come in with those gross ads, which is the momentum we're seeing in the bundling, the growth you see materialize in A&C. And we're seeing through the divestitures, we are losing customers, but they are generally customers that were low intent customers. So they were on a single product, maybe weren't doing things, hadn't done things for years. So that trade off is in there and continues to be something that we are working through on a net customer ad basis. Obviously, as we continue our divestitures and look at our portfolios, we've done a lot of that work in '23. So that will begin to abate for the work we've done in '23 and we'll continue to review our portfolio going forward. But it is bringing in the demand that has that higher intent customer and that stable demand we're seeing at the front of the funnel now. Ygal Arounian : Okay, great. That's really helpful. And then on -- understand the driver of GPV and bring more customers onto your paying platform. GMV is also continues to be really strong. Is there any way to qualify the growth drivers of GMV, whether it's by, I don't know, segment or business type or product, just to help to give a little bit more color around that? Thanks. Aman Bhutani : Yes, Ygal. A lot of what we talk about is GMV is often through our partnerships that we have. They tend to sell in the big categories, in the big verticals that you know about. Nothing significant to call out there, right? It follows to some extent the macro and sort of how customers are doing. Our focus very much is to provide them with a very competitive product so that they've got a system that works really well for them and it shows up in the results. Mark McCaffrey : Yeah. And I'll just add, the GPV is what we focus on because that's what we monetize within our customer base and that's what we're targeting to help grow payments. Ygal Arounian : Thanks, guys. Aman Bhutani : Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Wong from Oppenheimer. Ken, please go ahead. Ken Wong : Perfect. I just want to maybe kind of circle up on that 31% exit margin. You mentioned, a heavier spend in Q1 for renewals and launch costs. As we track to 31, would you expect that to be fairly linear or more back-end loaded, just given that there are some product investments up front? Mark McCaffrey : Yeah. So, giving you color around, I'll say how we expect it to rollout. We talked about 27 in Q1 because of the spending related to our renewals and certain other timing and expenses. And then, 31 is our exit strategy with 29 being the average. So we do think -- we do, like we saw last year, believe it'll ladder up. We haven't gotten to the exact numbers yet. We'll provide more color around that as we get further into the year. But I think you can put a trajectory around there. Now, there might be some timing of marketing expenses that we'll talk you through if that were to happen. But other than that, I would expect it to be similar to what we saw this year in laddering up through the year. Ken Wong : Got it. And then just a quick follow-up on the optimization side. Obviously, those are efforts that you guys will continue to push forward on and perhaps some new ones that you guys will talk about at Investor Day. As we look at the outlook, I guess, how much incremental optimization is already baked in there or are those plans yet to launch post-Investor Day? Aman Bhutani : Yeah. When we think about optimization and guiding to it, everything we have line of sight to is in the guidance already. But the fact is we're constantly evaluating new opportunities. Our teams have a very disciplined approach to looking at those opportunities and they bring forward proof points and what they need to do to be able to achieve those targets. And every quarter we're evaluating them and moving forward with new ideas. And if anything were to evolve, we would absolutely tell you more. We have a great track record of doing that over the last couple of years. And our goal is to just continue that momentum, continue that discipline. And it just compounds and that's a great thing. Ken Wong : Great. Fantastic. Thanks, guys. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Porter from Morgan Stanley. Elizabeth, please go ahead. Elizabeth Porter : Hi. Thanks for the question. I was hoping to get a little bit more clarity and just the walk for the fiscal '24 guide of 6% versus the exit rate in Q4 around 6%. I appreciate the disclosure on about one point from divestitures and migrations, but it feels like there's a couple of benefits as well, whether it's the aftermarket easing or pricing. And so, I'd love to just get a better sense on the view that you're taking on the underlying growth of the business and how that changes relative to Q4, just given some of the momentum bookings -- momentum that we've seen in bookings exiting the year. Thanks. Mark McCaffrey : Yeah. Thanks Elizabeth. Just a little further color, we're seeing the momentum in A&C and we've talked about the bookings. We've talked about the headwinds related to some of the divestiture activity. There are other things we built in there for the acquired or non-strategic hosting assets that still exist that haven't been integrated. We're assuming they're flat to down for the year as we continue to evaluate their long-term prospects. Things like aftermarket, we're assuming will be flat for the year, maybe slightly up, but again, no momentum being grown there -- coming there from continued growth in that market. That could change. There's some volatility in that market quarter to quarter, but we think on a long-term basis, that'll be the way to measure it. Still good growth in domains. It's still something that we're big in growing at percentage point wise is always difficult on a big base, but we think it'll be a steady increase as we see that demand coming in. So, when you put that all up and you put the headwinds into there at the first part of the year, we think 6% is a good point for the middle of the range. We know there's opportunities for the high-end of the range and we'll continue to monitor those. Elizabeth Porter : Great. Then just as a follow-up, when we think more holistically about the business, when you tend to have revenue upside, is that more likely to flow through on the margin side, just given you guys have already made a lot of improvements on the margin thus far? Or would you look to take any of that upside and potentially aggress more aggressively into the business, just given the opportunities ahead? Aman Bhutani : I think it's hard to project sort of multiple scenarios there, Elizabeth. It also kind of depends on the product mix in terms of which products exceed targets, but generally we're looking to, on a regular basis, balance growth and profitability. Again, our teams have a pretty disciplined process of bringing proof points in on where we invest and how we double down. On investments, something changes, our goal is to be very transparent with you guys on the call as well, so you'll be able to be on that journey with us. Mark McCaffrey : I think Aman put it perfect. We balance the growth and the profitability. Our goal is to drive free cash flow and ultimately free cash flow per share. We're constantly looking at the ways to do that and the ways to be creative to the long-term model. And we'll constantly evaluate what creates that opportunity for us that we can go into the future. Elizabeth Porter : Great. Thank you very much. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of John Byun on for Brent Thill at Jefferies. John, please go ahead. John Byun : Hi, thank you. I just had two questions. One, going back to Airo. I wonder if there's a way for you to quantify how broadly it might be rolled out in the U.S. I mean, is it 5% of your users using it? Or if there's any way to quantify in what you might think it might be by the end of the year or in sort of phase? And then the second question, kind of going back to the guidance and some of the headwinds, I think you had about 100 basis points in '23, guiding for about 124 with, I guess, abating in the second half. But wondering, will it be pretty much done at this point? Or do you still have maybe, I guess, more to reorganize, given some of the -- I guess, some of the still legacy hosting grantees who have left? Thank you. Aman Bhutani : Yeah. Let me start with Airo, John. We don't have sort of a number to disclose today, but we are looking forward to talking about this at our Investor Day. It's one of the things we are going to share with you. But just to give you order of magnitude, in the first six, eight weeks, hundreds of thousands of customers had already seen the Airo experience. So, this was not a small rollout by any stretch of the imagination. And that's just new customers, purchasing customers that I'm talking about. And you talked about sort of where we expect to get by the end of the year. Our timelines for Airo are much more aggressive than that. We expect a very large percentage of our new customers to be seeing Airo within the next few months. And by the end of the year, looking much more at how our existing customers are starting to engage with Airo and how can we make a real difference there. And I'll turn it to Mark for the headwind, 100 bps. Mark McCaffrey : Yeah. So, we did a lot of work in 2023, and that caused 100 basis points headwinds, both in '23 and '24. We're still continuing to evaluate our portfolio and we'll take any actions that we need to related to things that may not be strategic or things that aren't going to be accretive long-term to our model. So I wouldn't say we're done. I would say we'll continue to optimize, evaluate and make the decisions for the long-term business best we can. John Byun : Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Kuntarich from UBS. Chris, please go ahead. Chris Kuntarich : Hi, great. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe the first one would just be a clarification. When you're talking about the current Airo flow versus the Commerce Airo flow that we're going to be learning more about at the Analyst Day, can you just talk about maybe what products are not being included today as we're thinking about the existing flow? Is it really just payments or is there something else, kind of key products that we should be thinking about existing flow versus an Airo Commerce flow? Aman Bhutani : Yeah. What you saw us launch in November was Airo capabilities, mostly on our identity and presence products. And if you look at the entrepreneur's wheel, right, we lay out identity, presence and commerce and the customer needs that surround them. What we're going to show you at Investor Day is a sneak peek into all of the commerce capability layered with Airo, which includes not just payments capability, but core commerce functionality like inventory management and catalogs and how Airo will work on hardware, for example, versus on the web where today when we talk about identity and presence, you're seeing Airo capabilities mostly on the web. But how does that translate to a piece of hardware that a customer is holding and taking a transaction on? Chris Kuntarich : Got it. Very helpful. And just one follow up on the divestitures, any color to help us think about the margin benefit that they deliver from divestiture versus the full year guide? Mark McCaffrey : Yeah. I haven't quantified it out to the exact numbers, but keep in mind it benefits us in two areas. One, obviously it helps on normalized EBITDA on a go forward basis, but also reduces our CapEx spend because a lot of these divestitures related to also data centers that we no longer need and will go with the acquiring entity. So, there are two benefits we see. Both triangulate around helping our free cash flow and generating our free cash flow growth going forward. Chris Kuntarich : Got it. Thanks Mark. Thanks Aman. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes to the line of Ella Smith on for Alexei Gogolev at JP Morgan. Ella, please go ahead. Aman Bhutani : Hey, Ella. Ella Smith : Hi, team. Thank you for taking my question. It seems like price had the most to do with the margin expansion in the A&C segment. Is the spread of margin profiles of A&C products wide? If so, can you remind us what are the highest margin A&C products that drove the expansion? Mark McCaffrey : Yeah. I don't know, Ella, if we've gotten into that detail before, so I'll give you some high level and then hopefully that's helpful for you. A&C in and of itself is a higher margin business for us. There are certain areas that are from a gross margin perspective a little lower, for example, payments where we have the transaction fee, but they're coupled with software and subscriptions that drive it up. So when we look at it from a bundling perspective, they are very accretive to the margin as well as the normalized EBITDA line. I would say when I look at what's driving the growth in A&C, you have to look at it from -- there is a pricing aspect of it, no doubt, as we increase prices across certain products, but there also is a demand element of it, which when we see that customer go to that second product, we get the increase on that as well. So I would say it's a good mix. We haven't gotten into breaking down X times Y, but all that's contributing to the growth in A&C right now. Aman Bhutani : Yeah. And maybe to add some of the data we have shared, our website products, so Websites + Marketing, Managed WordPress are our highest margin products and they're growing double-digits. So obviously that's driving goodness in the A&C segment. Ella Smith : Great. Thank you, Aman and Mark. And for my second question, can you please speak about GoDaddy Payments and your latest strategies there? Also, how would you describe the customer profile of those who are adopting GoDaddy Payments? Aman Bhutani : The customer profile for GoDaddy Payments very much sort of squarely within the overall GoDaddy customer. We started with the micro seller, people selling $50,000, $100,000 a year, and we built up the million dollars, a customer who sells million dollars a year are now over a million dollars. That's the target market. That's what the product is targeted towards. So, we're very happy with the products we're growing. We're adding more capabilities in 2024. We're just going to keep broadening the omni commerce solution and tuning our go-to market. And that's what we're most excited about is just selling that broader view to our customers, like Mark said, getting to that really that third product that locks in retention for the long-term. Ella Smith : Great. Thank you so much. Aman Bhutani : Thank you. Christie Masoner : [Operator Instructions] It doesn't look like we have any more questions. We are at the top of the hour, so I'm going to hand it back over to Aman. End of Q&A: Aman Bhutani : Thank you, Christie. And thank you all for joining us. We're looking forward to seeing you at our Investor Day. We're excited about it. We have a lot of cool stuff to show and hopefully you're able to make it. Thank you.",

I'm Christie Masoner, Vice President of Investor Relations -- and with me today are Aman Bhutani, Chief Executive Officer; and Mark McCaffrey, Chief Financial Officer. Following prepared remarks, we will open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] On today's call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures and other operating and business metrics. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents may be found in the presentation posted on our Investor Relations site at investors.godaddy.net or in today's earnings release on our Form 8-K furnished with the SEC. Growth rates represent year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise noted. The matters we will be discussing today include forward-looking statements such as those related to future financial results and our strategies or objectives with respect to future operations. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed in detail in our periodic SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, May 2, 2024. And except to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to update these statements because of new information or future events.  With that, I'm pleased to introduce Aman. Amanpal Bhutani : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. At GoDaddy, our mission is to empower everyday entrepreneurs and make opportunity more inclusive for all. Our strategy relentlessly focuses on creating customer value and successfully transitions it to shareholder value. This is the driving force behind our profitable growth model, that maximizes free cash flow. I'm excited by the innovative experiences we are delivering for our customers, the dedication and velocity of execution of our teams and the trajectory those have created for our company. At our Investor Day, we shared our updated 3-year strategic framework and financial targets. As our Q1 results showcase, we are off to a strong start in 2024. In service of our North Star, we continue to expand our free cash flow meaningfully delivering 26% free cash flow growth year-over-year. The pillars behind our North Star are accelerating growth in our applications and commerce segment and disciplined margin expansion. In Q1, applications and commerce bookings accelerated to 22% and normalized EBITDA margin expanded 400 basis points. At our Investor Day, we also shared our progress on the GoDaddy software platform. The GoDaddy software platform helped create game-changing customer experiences like GoDaddy Airo. It combines the power of our infrastructure, large-scale data, AI and machine learning, experimentation and monetization to power our growth and margin drivers. Today, I wanted to provide an update on 4 of the key initiatives we shared previously. First, enhancing our pricing and bundling capabilities remains an important lever for GoDaddy. This quarter, we focused our pricing and bundling efforts on our productivity solutions which was a key contributor to the 22% bookings growth in applications and commerce segment. Our software platform has a vast amount of data and we leverage that data in more and more pricing and bundling experimentations. This gives us powerful insights on how and where to push forward as we continue to roll these learnings into additional products and bundles over time.  Second, creating seamless experiences for our customers continues to be a key priority. We are removing friction out of every piece of the entrepreneurs' wheel, saving our customers' time and money. We continuously work on simplification and performance improvements that deliver value for our customers. Examples from this quarter include simplifying the editor in Websites + Marketing, making it easier for customers to discover new capabilities, reducing provisioning time for the online store to a few seconds and using AI to streamline manage WordPress website creation to just a few clicks. Simplified, smart, fast experiences come across as magical to our customers and customer delight creates customer value, increasing willingness to pay.  Third, on commerce, I am pleased to share that annualized GPV continued to grow at a fast pace, surpassing the $2 billion milestone. The primary driver continues to be conversion within our existing base of customers. In addition, this quarter, we launched GoDaddy Smart Terminal Flex, a hand held device that allows our customers to accept payments anywhere on the fly.  Our commerce offering is growing and sets us up well for our 2024 focus on driving higher-margin subscription revenue through the sale of tailored omnicommerce  solutions to our customers. The significant value we are driving with our commerce offerings also introduces an opportunity for us to evolve our pricing structure within payments. Last week, we began rolling out phased transaction fee increases across our customer population, while still maintaining our status as the best value in payments.  Fourth, we continue to be tremendously excited about the range of possibilities with GoDaddy Airo. As planned, we started rolling out GoDaddy Airo to our base in late March. Go Daddy Airo opens the door to many opportunities across discovery, engagement and monetization and represents an incremental opportunity as a powerful growth driver over the next couple of years. We have continued to rapidly iterate this experience, and I wanted to share a couple of examples. More customers are discovering GoDaddy Airo, and we have more for them. We launched a new payment  card to test engagement with payments. A card is a visual representation of a product that is automatically set up and configured by GoDaddy Airo on just a domain purchase. We see early indication that GoDaddy Airo does a better job of discovery and engagement with pay links than our normal methods. Another significant change in monetization is that we introduced a pay wall for websites built by GoDaddy Airo. We are actively testing different points at which this pay wall can be triggered and this is a new flow that we are excited to optimize. While all this data is early, we are also excited to see that websites built by GoDaddy Airo are performing well. More domain customers are opting in for a website when we offer them GoDaddy Airo. And key product metrics are either ahead or within our expectations. These metrics give us confidence that we are achieving our goal of a seamless, intuitive, magical experience for our customers. I also wanted to quickly share that GoDaddy Airo domain search is now on the home page for all desktop users globally. And we are starting to test opportunities to optimize the traditional search experience using these new capabilities. Last but not least, GABI our guide assist bot, is now rolled out across our entire care footprint and is handling escalations and questions from our guides. GABI also helps with providing call summaries and case notes, helping our guides be more efficient. Every month that goes by GABI becomes smarter. And over time, we can add use cases and drive further adoption.  In closing, we continue to deliver on our key initiatives and unlock new avenues of growth and value creation for the long term. The GoDaddy team is a driven group and shares an unwavering determination to fearlessly push boundaries and prioritize, continuously experiment, meticulously track results and strive for improvement each day. I am thrilled with the speed of execution as we continue to strive to exceed customer expectations, propel profitable growth and create enduring shareholder value. With that, here's Mark. Mark McCaffrey : Thanks, Aman. We are pleased to announce our strong Q1 results and continued track record of durable growth. We've demonstrated attractive progress toward our North Star, delivering strong free cash flow of $327 million, alongside continued execution of our capital allocation strategy, which reduced our fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of the quarter to 146 million.  The key pillars underlying our North Star are the double-digit growth in our application and commerce segment revenue of 13%, coupled with disciplined normalized EBITDA margin expansion to 28%, which converts to free cash flow and an impressive 1 :1 ratio. Through our seamless technology and comprehensive one-stop shop approach, we are building improved customer value. Our strategic focus is delivering results that drive better attach and conversion while maintaining impressive retention rates. Together, these efforts are building a foundation for enduring shareholder value. Moving to our financial results for the quarter. Total revenue grew to $1.1 billion, up 7% on a reported and constant currency basis, and exceeding the high end of our guided range on the strength of the pricing and bundling initiative as well as strong demand in our aftermarket. ARPU grew 5% to $206 on a trailing 12-month basis and our customer count remains stable despite the headwinds from our divestiture and migration efforts, also impacting revenue by approximately 100 basis points. Additionally, customers with 2 or more products remained above 50% and our customer retention rate remained at 85%. Double-clicking into the segments, our higher-margin Applications & Commerce segment delivered $383 million in revenue, growing 13%, in line with our guided range. The drivers of this performance included strength in our bundling and pricing initiative across all major product offering, including productivity solutions, website building products and commerce.  Additionally, annualized GPV for GoDaddy payments grew to $2 billion for the first time. Segment EBITDA margin was 42%, up over 300 basis points. Lastly, ARR for Applications & Commerce grew 13% to $1.5 billion. Core platform revenue totaled $725 million, growing 4% which exceeded our guide on strength in domains, up 7% and aftermarket, up 12%. Our growth was driven by strong demand for domains in the primary and secondary market, increased pricing in the primary market and a higher average transaction value in the secondary market. This was partially offset by a decrease in hosting our divestitures. Segment EBITDA margin for core platform grew to 30%, up nearly 300 basis points. Lastly, ARR for our core platform segment was $2.3 billion, up 3%. Consolidated normalized EBITDA grew 25% to $313 million, while delivering an expanded margin of 28%, up 400 basis points, exceeding our guide. Margin expansion was driven by continued leverage gains within all expense line items on the P&L. Moving on to bookings. In Q1, we achieved 9% growth on our reported and constant currency basis, reaching $1.3 billion. As a reminder, bookings primarily represent the cash collected during the period. Applications in commerce bookings grew 22% from improvements in pricing and bundling for productivity solutions, website building products and commerce. Core platform bookings increased 3% on the performance of domains in aftermarket on strong demand for domains in the primary and secondary market, offset by headwinds in hosting.  Subscription bookings grew 2 points ahead of subscription revenue. The impressive momentum in our bookings, coupled with our commitment to profitable growth and ability to convert normalized EBITDA to free cash flow at a ratio of 1 :1 powers our substantial cash generation. Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter grew 18% to $359 million and free cash flow grew 26% to $327 million. We are committed to effectively managing our balance sheet and the proactive measures we took to reprice our long-term debt resulted in a 30% favorable change in cash interest payments compared to last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter were also down 81% from data center divestitures. Through April 30, we repurchased 2.8 million shares year-to-date, totaling $346 million. This brings the cumulative shares repurchased under our current authorizations to $2.9 billion and 37 million shares, reducing gross shares outstanding since the inception of these authorizations by 22%, ahead of our 3-year targeted reduction of 20%. Fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of the quarter were 146 million shares. Our successful share repurchase program continues to drive impressive ROI for our free cash flow deployment. We have $1.1 billion remaining under our current authorization, and we plan to be in the market every quarter, subject to market conditions and other factors, with a minimum offset to share-based compensation dilution. Moving to the balance sheet. We finished Q1 with $664 million in cash and total liquidity of $1.7 billion. Net debt was $3.2 billion, representing net leverage of 2.4x on a trailing 12-month basis. Shifting to our outlook. Given our strong start to the year, we are raising the lower end of the range for our full year revenue guidance. We now expect full year revenue to be between $4.5 billion and $4.56 billion, representing growth of 6.5% at the midpoint. Additionally, we are targeting Q2 total revenue in the range of $1.1 million to $1.12 billion, representing growth of 6% at the midpoint of our range. We expect applications in commerce to deliver low to mid-teens growth for Q2 and the full year. In our core platform segment, we expect revenue to deliver low single-digit growth in the second quarter and the full year. We are proud of our track record of margin expansion, and we will continue to maintain operational discipline to drive further leverage in our model. We expect normalized EBITDA for Q2 to be approximately 28%. Additionally, we remain on track to meet 31% normalized EBITDA margin in Q4. Full year normalized EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 29%. We are on track for our full year unlevered free cash flow and free cash flow targets of $1.4 billion plus and $1.2 billion plus, respectively. On capital allocation, we will continue to evaluate opportunities for shareholder return, subjecting them to our published rigorous returns-based framework to ensure we achieve the optimal mix for cash flow deployment. The entire GoDaddy team remains committed to delivering against the 3-year framework we shared at Investor Day with 6% to 8% annual top-line growth fueled by our Applications & Commerce segment, accelerating normalized EBITDA margin expansion to 33% by 2026 and generation of $4.5 billion plus in cumulative free cash flow. Our profitable growth and 1 :1 normalized EBITDA to free cash flow ratio, coupled with our disciplined capital allocation framework, creates significant value for our shareholders. While I am pleased with our progress towards our North Star, we are far from done, and I continue to have strong confidence in our strategy and execution. With that, we will have Christie Masoner from our Investor Relations team, open the call for questions. Christie Masoner : Thanks, Mark. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ygal Arounian from Citi. Ygal Arounian : Maybe I'm just going to start on the strong bookings growth. And I know you talked about pricing particularly in A&C. But 22% booking growth there, 1Q. Almost 10% overall coming off of the strong booking number in 4Q as well. Typically, we think of that type of acceleration as really meaningful in driving revenue growth acceleration in the back half, but we didn't see that in your guidance. So how should we be thinking about how that translates and what all that means as we kind of look through to the whole year here? Mark McCaffrey : Ygal, thanks for the question. We couldn't be more excited about the bookings growth in A&C and the momentum we have coming out of Q1 and the impact on the rest of the year, no doubt about it. As we get into the bundling, just a reminder, revenue is recognized from the bookings and it can be on different periods of time. So that momentum will continue. But given the size of our business, obviously, it takes a while to show up into the revenue growth numbers as we go on, couldn't be more excited about it, though. Just a reminder too, we do have a few headwinds out there relating to the dispositions. Those will peak in Q2. We expect them to abate throughout the year. But again, we still have a few of those headwinds out there. So again, we have great momentum, but we're trying to balance some of the actions that we took. So when you put that all together, I would say we're comfortable that lowering the low end of the guide was the appropriate thing to do, and we'll continue to keep everyone updated as we go throughout the rest of the year. But yes, we are pretty excited about some of the pricing and bundling initiatives and the impact they had on Q1 bookings. Ygal Arounian : Okay. Great. Really helpful. And maybe on Airo, I know you gave some qualitative comments here, but any more you could share? You're rolling out internationally, where we've got a couple of months under our belt here. You mentioned you're seeing kind of domain customers move to Airo, when they're offered it. Anything you're seeing, incremental uplift in conversion, ARPU growth on the -- whether it's applications account collectively or just Website + Marketing, anything else investors can kind of hang their hats on how well Airo is doing? Or what is sort of going to drive the conversion you've been expecting? Amanpal Bhutani : Thanks, Ygal. Super excited about Airo. It's the best vehicle we have built to carry products to our customers. We know it's doing very well with new customers. And as I've shared, we've started to roll it out to our base as well. Airo just does a fantastic job of getting our customers engaged. And the metrics that we shared around it, they continue to be about discovery, which means our customers finding that GoDaddy has all these products about engagement, where they start using those products or you can say, attach them and then monetization where they start to pay for those products.  And we're very methodically moving through those 3 phases. What I can share today is that on discovery, we're seeing fantastic results there. Customers buy a domain, they see their cards, they engage with the cards, customers are starting to learn that GoDaddy has way more products for me, way more offerings for me. And I shared a little comment about pay links in the prepared remarks but I'll also share coming soon site, which is a one-page website that gets created with a domain, gets a great amount of engagement. Just regular website is getting more engagement with Airo than when we didn't have Airo. So these cards are really starting to take off in terms of discovery and engagement, which give us confidence that as we move towards monetization, we're going to have multiple levers at play. And we've started to build the pay walls and do stuff. And over the next couple of years, we think this will roll out very well and deliver results for years to come. Christie Masoner : Next question comes from the line of Mark Zgutowicz from Benchmark. Mark Zgutowicz : Maybe just a follow-up on that impressive A&C bookings number. Curious how much you'd attribute to product attach versus pricing in terms of that acceleration? And on the pricing side, just curious how pervasive your AI or value-based pricing initiative is across your A&C base. Does it touch all A&C customers at this point? That's the first question. Amanpal Bhutani : Thanks, Mark. Our sort of value-based pricing, AI-based pricing and bundling initiatives have not gone across all A&C. It's starting to roll out across a lot. What you're seeing in the 22% application and then bookings growth is the combination of pricing and bundling, really touching our productivity and starting to hit our website business, too. So super excited about that. There is more to go there. So we're going to continue to invest in that area and go across not just AMC, but over time, go to every customers of GoDaddy and bringing them on to these new sort of pricing and bundling approach that we have. Mark Zgutowicz : Okay. Got it. And then I think you had mentioned that Airo is leading to some increasing website attach rate for your domain customers. I was just hoping you might be able to expand on that a bit, maybe just some KPIs that you're seeing, maybe conversion rate, but that seems to be maybe awakening a sleeping giant there for some time. Just kind of trying to get a sense of how significant that could be. Amanpal Bhutani : Yes, it's still early days, Mark, with our new customers. Obviously, that's a smaller stream of customers. With our new customers, we do see significant take rates for like a coming-soon website or actual website attach. We see that engagement -- sort of discovery and engagement and are doing really well. But the large, large opportunity, of course, is in our base. And we're literally not even 5, 6 weeks from putting Airo into our base. So it's going to take a little time, given the large customer base and our approach of going into it in a systematic manner. We have lots of learnings from taking productivity into our base, taking commerce into our base. We're taking that same methodical approach in going into the base. It's going to take a little bit more time for us to gather data to be able to sort of share it publicly to say this is what we see. But I can tell you, we're super excited about it. And if the new customer engagement is any indicator of the base, there will be years, many, many years, we'll be talking about this. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Wong from Oppenheimer. Kenneth Wong : Great. I wanted to maybe kind of pick your brain in terms of the rationale behind kind of changing payment pricing structure and then how you think about how that could impact the near-term dynamics and if you're sensing any kind of customer pushback there. Amanpal Bhutani : Yes. We're very methodical, Ken, on our approach to pricing. And like we've talked about, everything is tested. So we have tests out there, as we said, it's on a phased basis. And we're really trying to create multiple offerings for our customers. And while we maintain our position in the industry for being the best value for money. It allows us to have differentiated products within our portfolio and reach more customers. So this is something you'll see more of, and we'll talk about it over the next few quarters. But, really, what it opens up -- us up for a broader commerce solution with differentiated pricing across different bundles. And we're trying to set things up for the same sort of mindset of pricing and bundling activity together for commerce as we are bringing [ available ] of products. Kenneth Wong : Got it. And then maybe, Mark, just in terms of -- just remind us kind of what we should be thinking in terms of the lag between kind of revenue and bookings. And specifically, on A&C, where there's obviously a much larger delta from kind of the teens to the 20s, like how -- what -- just help us kind of think through what that convergence looks like. Mark McCaffrey : Yes. And I'll take it up a level, too. When we think about the bookings to revenue, we have multiple different products, multiple different terms, the revenue can be -- come out in many different ways. The way we look at it is we think bookings is going to be 1 to 2 points ahead of revenue for 2024. And that'll give us a lot of momentum as we continue to see the results of the bundling and pricing initiative as well as the momentum we're seeing in things like aftermarket. Amanpal Bhutani : Just a quick add, Ken, that our general term in just around 12 months, a little over. So that can give you sort of the idea of how bookings will take about 12 months, get distributed about over 12 months for revenue. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Beck from Raymond James. Josh Beck : Yes, I just wanted to ask about some of the success with the pay links. It sounds like it's driven an uplift on discovery and engagement maybe versus what you had in place prior. So are there certain channels, whether it's tech or social where it's doing a better job of driving engagement. Just, would like to understand a little bit, just some more context behind that comment, if possible. Amanpal Bhutani : Yes. The biggest sort of encouragement for our customers, the best vehicle we've put in place for pay link attach is being in Airo, right? And the way it happens is that when the customer buys the domain name, all these cards, all these capabilities get set up automatically. And we introduced pay link in a very similar way as we introduced the other capabilities. And what we found is we obviously had existing ways of helping our customers discover pay links, helping them engage with them and start to transact using pay links. But Airo sort of brought it together in a very simple manner. It was right there in front of customers and we saw the customers engage with it at significantly higher rates than without Airo. So that's what's driving sort of the engagement with pay links. Overall, for GPV, we did hit the $2 billion annualized GPV milestone this last quarter. And the biggest part of that continues to be going into our base of customers and converting them to GoDaddy payments. Josh Beck : Okay. That's super helpful. And maybe just kind of a follow-on to that last point. When you look at the existing base and you think about the conversion opportunities, should we be looking at, really, when these customers come up for renewal with their existing payment provider, that's an opportunity for you. Is there maybe a chance to kind of put some type of firmer pressure on them to really kind of incentivize them to move over? Just help us kind of understand how you're helping promote that conversion. Amanpal Bhutani : Yes. There are some customer events -- customer-side events, for example, like you said, a customer coming up on a renewal. That may create an opportunity. But what we really lead with is that we have a relationship with these customers, right? GoDaddy has 65-plus transactions in NPS and in Care. Our customers are used to having a great relationship with us. So when we engage them, number one, they're open to the idea of GoDaddy offering them GoDaddy Payments.  The second pillar of what we approached them with is that we offer them the one-stop shop. They have other relationships with GoDaddy. We can introduce one bill, one partner to work with. We can make it easier, and that's attractive to our customers because a lot of them start by saying, \"Oh, I didn't even realize that you had payments.\" \"Oh, it's pretty great.\" \"Oh, I like the way this works.\" \"Oh, this works seamlessly with all my other stuff I do with GoDaddy.\" So that's a win for us too.  And then you've got pricing that's the best value in the market today, which sort of comes in as a third pillar of that sales pitch. And what we continuously are finding is that, that works. That encourages our customers who have great relationships with us, who run micro businesses adopt GoDaddy Payments, and that's what's been driving our GPV growth. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Kesavabhotla from Baird. Vikram Kesavabhotla : Hey, can you hear me? Mark McCaffrey : Yes. Hey, Vik. Vikram Kesavabhotla : My first question is for Aman. I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that GABI has now been rolled out to the entire care team. Just curious what the early data points have been there in terms of the impact that's having on efficiency. I know at the Investor Day, you talked about the potential for that to reduce time and interactions for the team. Just curious what you're seeing so far there and what the early reception has been from the care team.  And then my second question is for Mark. It looks like you exceeded the first quarter guidance on EBITDA margin. Just wondering if you could talk more about some of the drivers of the outperformance there. And how much of that was specific to the quarter versus factors that could ultimately benefit the balance of the year? And I'll leave it there. Amanpal Bhutani : Vikram, a quick word on GABI. I'm super excited for what Gabby offers us over the long term, right? Being able to bring the massive amount of data that only GoDaddy has, working with 21 million paying customers and many more over the years, using AI to bring it together and putting it on the fingertips of every guide in the company, that's a powerful combination, right? And where we are is the tool is rolled out. The guys are starting to use it. There is, of course, always a little bit of time for adoption and training for people learning how to use even a new tool that's GenAI powered.  But super excited about it. I mentioned a couple of use cases that are already live with GABI, where GABI's able to do the summaries or just start to take on tasks that otherwise guides would have had to do sort of start to move up from guides doing that -- to automation and GABI taking care of that. So there's lots of use cases we have in mind. We have a fantastic roadmap over the next couple of years in front of us. And yes, pretty excited about it. Mark McCaffrey : And Vik, on the normalized EBITDA margin, I would say, quarter-to-quarter, you may see some fluctuations depending on the timing of spend. Overall, if you look at Q1, we've always said accelerated A&C will be a tailwind to our ability to expand our margins over time. And with the pacing you saw in Q1, we saw some of the benefit of that. For the year, we're on track for the 31% to exit, and we feel good about that, and we're on track for the 29% for the entire year. And obviously, we've talked about our ability to expand that going out. And all those -- all that framework remains in place, and we continue to see the benefit of the ANC tailwind related to that. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Aaron Kessler from Seaport. Aaron Kessler : Maybe just first on any update just on macro, just what trends are you seeing there? And I know customers are flat kind of year-over-year. I assume there was maybe some disposition impact on that? If you can just talk on that? And then also the -- if you may, to that point, trends in gross adds that you're seeing along with that? Amanpal Bhutani : Thanks, Aaron. On the macro, I think the word we internally feel represents it best is a steadiness to the macro. And I think that's been a positive for us, right? We had and we talked about it in 2023, strong gross adds and customers coming -- continuing to come in at the top of the funnel. And of course, some divestitures and integrations as an offset to that for the company, which I look at that as a short-term gain. But good strong gross adds coming in.  The steadiness in the macro, we believe, will continue to power that. And again, continuing to have a lot of firepower in terms of really efficient marketing at our disposal. Our marketing is getting better and better. It's driven with data and lots of opportunities for us to continue to explore to put more dollars at play and get really efficient returns on them. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Jian Li from Evercore. Jian Li : So I want to kind of go back to Airo. First, maybe just to -- it sounds like Airo's still in the early days of monetization. Are you baking in any kind of contribution to revenue and/or any contribution to bookings for this quarter for that matter? So if you can kind of talk about the contribution here. And also, I think in the Investor Day, you sort of alluded to Airo being applicable broadly across DIY and Pro users. So I'm just wondering if there is any product features for Airo that you're building specifically for the pros or agency community? Mark McCaffrey : Yes. Thanks, Jian. And I'll start with the first part, and Aman will probably answer the second part there. The way we're looking at Airo right now, we are in the discovery and the engagement phase. We haven't hit the monetization phase. We're very early on. We're looking at all the statistics. We're looking at the level of engagement around it, but nothing has been built into our bookings or revenue for that matter in our model today. Amanpal Bhutani : Yes. And I think the way you might think about it, a lot of value is being created for customers with Airo because they're getting a bundling -- bundled experience that's seamless, that's connected. And some of that monetization opportunity we have talked about like Airo Premium and pay walls, but there's also a monetization opportunity that would happen at renewals, but that would be a year out from the time the customer bought the domain. So just, Jian, keep that in mind as well. On your question on Airo features for Pro, the feature that I'm personally very excited about is Airo Insights, which is the capability where Airo assess an existing website and give super actionable advice to Pros and how to improve that website. We have a version of that, that's going to be able to work for customers, too. But that product, from the first day, from the ground up, it was built for Pros. Its first implementation is with WordPress and it's a fantastic product. Like, we get great engagement from pros on it. Again, as with all Airo products, that is still at the discovery and engagement phase. We have not added monetization yet. But this year, we expect to test a number of monetized methods for Airo Insights as well. Jian Li : Great. Wonderful. And then just a quick follow-up on the GPV strengths that you're seeing. If you can parse it out a little bit, is that more customer attached growing? Is it more just the growing GPV per customer? And it's coming from WordPress marketing? Or more on the managed WordPress side? If you can just talk about also the growth of these 2 segments separately as well. Amanpal Bhutani : Thanks, Jian. The biggest piece of the driver for the GPV growth is actually converting our customers in the base. And a lot of that has to do with a broader solution than just the online solution, right? We have our hardware. We own the full stack from the hardware to the operating system on it to the applications on top of it. And what we're taking, really, is sort of this omnicommerce solution that we're trying to bundle in different ways and target to the customers that we have. So that's actually the biggest driver of the GPV. And it's a fantastic driver for GPV, right? We want to be in-store with the customer and online. We don't want to be just online with the customer. We want to sort of have access to all of their business. And that's what we're doing with the base of our customers. And very often, it starts with a sale of a piece of a hardware, and that's a great start. Mark McCaffrey : And like we've always said, the biggest opportunity in front of us for commerce is converting our existing customer base. That's where we're seeing the growth in the GPV today. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Porter from Morgan Stanley. Elizabeth Elliott : I wanted to ask again on Airo. We're clearly seeing the benefit with more attach and ARPU, but I wanted to better understand how Airo might be changing any sort of top-of-funnel demand. You noted some stronger gross customer adds. And then second, what is the potential implication on improving customer growth after some muted growth over the last couple of years? Amanpal Bhutani : Yes. On Airo changing the top of the funnel, we're excited about being able to market the GoDaddy brand as a provider of not just this expansive set of products and capabilities, but the provider that can bring you those capabilities in a seamless, intuitive almost magical manner. So Airo is not just an experience for our customers, not just a platform that GoDaddy has, it's something we're taking into our marketing and looking at ways to really dive into customer perception. And if the customer thinks about GoDaddy and thinks about domains, Airo is going to help the customer think about GoDaddy and think about a lot of things together. So that is the largest piece of shifting the top of the funnel with Airo, Elizabeth, if that makes sense, is really taking the go-to-market plan for Airo into every bit of our marketing into every channel that we have and making that really, really successful.  In terms of customer growth, yes, we absolutely see, in the medium and long term, a growing customer base or GoDaddy. We see that as a key sort of point of growth. We have the brand awareness globally that is fantastic. Like, it's unparalleled. We have amazing products to bring to them. We have plenty of firepower in our P&L to be able to reach those customers, right? So we absolutely believe there are a lot more customers for GoDaddy to reach and add to that $21 million every year. Mark McCaffrey : Yes. And we continue to be impacted by the divestitures and migrations that we've talked about. A lot of that's peaking in Q2 as some of these are starting to lap, but will abate over time. And as I always say in these scenarios, while we're attracting more of the customers with a higher intent that are attaching to that second product and they're engaging on the bundles and is very, very happy with, on the back end, we're losing what I call low-calorie customers that weren't really in there with any intent. So we're happy with the model. It should start to abate over time, and then we'll keep everybody posted on a quarterly basis. Elizabeth Elliott : Great. That makes a lot of sense. And then a follow-up on the margin side of the equation. There's the kind of mix shift to ANC, also leverage as revenue growth reaccelerates and you guys are taking also some specific kind of cost actions to manage expenses. So just wondering if there's any way to, like, stack rank some of these drivers as it relates to the margin expansion that you guys have in the outlook. Mark McCaffrey : Yes. Elizabeth, I look at it in 3 buckets. We have the, what I would say, the tailwind related to AMC growing at a higher profit point, which continues to be, I would say, a big driver. The other big driver is our access to global talent pools now is our international base grows, our ability to move into markets that are more cost effective is helping us. And then I would say the third, probably not as big as the other 2, but the third continues to be our infrastructure simplification. And that is just getting more efficient, reducing the amount of locations we have, getting out of leases, that type of environment. So those 3 buckets are the big contributors to how we continue to expand our margin, and that will continue as we go into the outer years. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Trevor Young at Barclays. Trevor Young : On aftermarket, second consecutive quarter here of double-digit growth, but meanwhile, it looks like your full year expectations there are still kind of in low single-digit territory. What's driving that outsized growth right now? It looks like ATVs are up almost 20% on the year plus the benefit of easier compares. Just trying to understand if something has structurally changed in demand for that business. What's causing that resurgence? And relatedly, what would cause it to slow from here? Mark McCaffrey : Thanks, Trevor. And we definitely have seen a pick up, what I would say, in the average transaction value. And in Q1, we saw the return of the larger transactions that have been missing in the prior periods. Again, we don't build that into the model because they come in on the short term, and they can create some volatility. But we were -- we did see the benefit of that and the 12% growth in aftermarket this quarter.  From a steady-state point of view, we still think this is a business that is going to be low single-digit growth. We're continuing to see the volume at the lower end grow. We're continuing to see good average transaction value with the lower end grow. But we definitely saw the benefit in Q1 of some of those larger transactions. But like we've said, we don't build that into the model and we only build in what we can see right in front of us. Trevor Young : That makes sense. And just a quick follow-up on the Heart Internet sale. How much of a drag will that be on hosting revs? And was that previously contemplated in the '24 guide? Mark McCaffrey : Yes. I think the best way to say that, we previously contemplated that when we were talking about our guide for this year. We hadn't closed it and announced it, but we're far enough along we built it into the model. Trevor Young : Okay. And anything on sizing the drag? Mark McCaffrey : We look at it as overall. The divestitures are about 100 basis points for the year with that peaking in the second quarter and abating through the rest of the year. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of John Byun from Jefferies. Sang- Jin Byun : John Byun for Brent Thill. You pushed through the price increases on productivity and now on payments. I'm just wondering how much pricing power is left, especially given it seems a lot of SMBs is still somewhat struggling. And then on that last point, I know there was a question earlier on macro, but anything you could share on the health of the SMBs? Anything different this Q1 versus last quarter? I don't know if there's any change, whether better or worse in terms of the SMB health and sentiment. Amanpal Bhutani : John, on the pricing and bundling, I just want to clarify a little bit. These are not push pricing changes. It really is an approach to create new and differentiated bundles, to have pricing that's value-based. It's differentiated. It's not sort of a simple price increase that one might see. All of the pricing and bundling capabilities are based on sort of large-scale data and machine learning. We see -- we have a very large customer base the more we apply this thinking. We do see some runway in front of us to do that. And so we think it's a great lever.  I'll maybe point back to our growth and margin drivers slide during the Investor Day and sort of pricing and bundling was the biggest pillar. Because, again, it's not just about price increase. It's about creating the right bundle and pricing it in a dynamic manner to get the best return, both for bookings growth and for renewal at the same time. So that's just a little bit of context for how you might think about our pricing and bundling initiative.  In terms of the macro, I think the best word we've used is sort of we see a steadiness to the macro, and we think that's a positive. We think, for our customers, they always tend to be an optimistic group. We never do a survey with our customers and they never come back with sort of, \"Oh, I think the world -- the sky's falling.\" They're always optimistic about their business. And the steady macro, I think, just helps them have a little bit more optimism. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Kuntarich from UBS. Christopher Kuntarich : Great. Maybe just first one would be around pay walls. Can you just unpack a little bit what you mean by that in the use of that around Airo? Second question would be just back to marketing. Aman, you were calling out, really, just kind of the strength of GoDaddy's brand overall at this point. We saw some really nice leverage in the first quarter. Just, how should we be thinking about kind of leverage for the remainder of the year? And what's kind of predicated in that guide from a marketing perspective? And maybe kind of how you think about using -- continuing to -- or needing to continue to push on Airo awareness versus maybe more lower funnel tactics? Amanpal Bhutani : Yes. Let me start by talking about the Airo pay wall. The type of thing we're talking about is you buy a domain name and suddenly, you've got a logo, you've got a coming soon website created. You've got 8 versions of websites created that you can choose one from. You've got an e-mail address that's been created for you. You've got a pay link that's ready to go. You can take payments on it, 60 seconds later, right? You've got a marketing campaigns that are set up for you already. We're looking for engagement and we're gathering data about how customers engage with these different capabilities of products, the cards, as we call them, right? The pay wall is a technology which basically looks at that usage, and at a certain point of value created for the customer, it will interrupt the customer and say, hey, if you want, let's say, a better logo or if you want to improve this website in a certain way or you want to edit this website here, you actually have to start to have a paid plan. Like it was great that you had -- that Airo did all this work for you and we love it that you love it, but at this point now, you have to pay for it, right? And that's pay wall and sort of being having the ability to dynamically become part of the customer journey and introduce friction where you want to get paid is a sophisticated sort of capability that SaaS companies have. And I'm very excited to have it at GoDaddy too, right? And Airo, given its breadth of products, really offers us the capability to have lots of different pay walls that were tests. So I shared an example, I think, in the past about a pay wall for websites. But slowly, what you're going to see is us sort of understanding the customer journey, the flow and then interrupting that and looking to sort of sign up with a subscription with that customer. And in terms of marketing, as I said, we're -- I'm going to say this, and Mark will probably say something related to it, and we laugh about it sometimes internally. I'd, of course, like to spend a lot on marketing with Airo and tell the whole world about the capability we have. But we're very disciplined in our approach of looking at the return on marketing. And that has to do with my history, going back many, many years, relying on gathering a lot of data, how is our market, how our marketing channels are working, how are we really getting value from them. So we'll continue to stay super-disciplined and look to spend whatever we can within our guidelines. But I think in terms of leverage for the year, Mark, do you want to\u2026 Mark McCaffrey : Yes, and this applies to marketing and all investments, really, at the end of the day. We like to use the data in order to understand what's going to get us the best return. And when we feel we understand that, we're willing to invest in. Marketing is the same thing for us, right? We want to get to the point where we understand the monetization formula and then we can start to optimize for that. So we feel good about our ability to make those decisions across the board and to leverage across all of our P&L. And obviously, our ability to continue to expand the margins, especially as we see the uptick in AMC and the tailwind that, that gives us go on to the future. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Naved Khan from B. Riley. Naved Khan : So just a quick question on the booking growth for AMC. It's pretty impressive. And in your commentary, you kind of attributed that to pricing and bundling. I just want to develop, like, on that. Is it more bundling versus pricing that's kind of driving this? How should we understand it from the outside looking in? And then at the Investor Day, Aman, I think you talked about value-based pricing and leveraging dynamic pricing and things like that. How much of that is happening currently? And how much scope of that is there to kind of do it further and more broadly? Amanpal Bhutani : Yes, Naved, thanks for that question. So the approach we've taken with value-based pricing is that the pricing and bundling initiatives sort of works together on it, if you will. They go hand in hand. Because it's really looking at what the engagement is for that customer, what value that customer has, what bundles and services that we can create for them and then how should we price that.  And where we -- and Mark talked a little bit about the areas where we've already invested in that. We actually want to take that thing across our whole portfolio. So sitting here, we do believe, as we said at Investor Day, there's sort of at least 3 years of goodness for us that we see with the pricing and bundling initiative. And we're excited about going after that opportunity because we do have a huge base, 21 million customers, that we can approach with that type of thinking. Naved Khan : No, that's what I wanted to kind of get a better handle on. It seems like you're leveraging both kind of ultimately get the sale done or renewal happen. Maybe just a quick follow-up on CapEx. It wasn't discussed. Should I just assume it stays where you guided to it at the beginning of the year? Or maybe has it changed? Mark McCaffrey : Full year guide hasn't changed. It could fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. Obviously, we're, overall, reducing our spend year-over-year. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Alexei Gogolev from JPMorgan. Alexei Gogolev : Mark, I was wondering if you could give us some insight how we can grow ARR was doing this year? And what is your expectation for the rest of the year? Mark McCaffrey : Yes. Without getting into the specifics of growth rate around ARR, Alexei, just remember, it is our lagging of our lagging indicators. So generally, we'll trail revenue, not only in the bookings to revenue formula, but it also trails the revenue to -- in the trailing 12 months that impacts it. So while we expect to see a healthy growth in ARPU, that we -- again, it's going to lag throughout the year, but it will continue to increase over time.  On ARR, we continue to look at it growing as our subscription base continues to grow. It is a good sign of health. We continue to see that ARR has been very healthy in our applications and commerce as well as very steady within our core platform. We continue to say that subscription revenue should be 1 to 2 points ahead of overall -- sorry, subscription bookings should be 1 to 2 points ahead of revenue throughout the year. Alexei Gogolev : Okay. And then the second question was about WorldPay partnership. Could you provide an update on how it's faring and also, that significant improvement in total GPV or annualized GPV, has there been any tailwind coming from that WorldPay partnership? Amanpal Bhutani : Yes. The WorldPay partnership isn't driving the GPV growth necessarily. And we like the partnership with WorldPay. We're excited about with the new team there. It's doing -- obviously, they had a lot going on over the last few months, but we think they're in a great place. We're very excited about the product offering we have with them, and we're excited about them sort of selling more and more every month. So that's where we're at. But our GPV is mostly growing without selling into our own base. Christie Masoner : And our last question comes from the line of Ygal Arounian from Citi again. Ygal Arounian : Last week, Verisign made some comments about how they're going to kind of ramp up marketing spend, in particular. How they're going to work a little bit more one-on-one with their distributor partners to try to open up the funnel for dotcom in particular. So -- and I'm getting a lot of questions, and there's been a lot of interest from investors on that point, so I thought I'd just ask it from your point of view and what that might mean for you. What you're seeing on dotcom or just in general as both a registrar and registry, what you guys are seeing in kind of like the -- I know you have broader exposure, so what you're seeing in that disparity in dotcom versus total domains. And if you're getting a little bit more support from Verisign, does that mean more efficiency in marketing spend where you can kind of spend a little bit more, you open up the top of the funnel a little bit more? Just what can that mean for your business? Amanpal Bhutani : Thanks, Ygal. I think you kind of answered the question. We have diversified portfolio of domains, right? You're familiar with it. We have the opportunity to sell over 400 different TLDs. The opportunity to have massive brand awareness globally. We are in more markets than any other domain registrar what have you, right? And then we have the opportunity to really create merchandising and offerings that are unique compared to other players. So we think we have a great diversified portfolio on domains. Obviously, we love all our partners. And if a large partner wants to do more, we're always happy to do more. We want to work with everyone. Christie Masoner : We have now finished the Q&A. I'll turn it back over to Aman. Amanpal Bhutani : Thank you for joining us. We'll see you in a quarter. Bye-bye.",

And with me today are Aman Bhutani, Chief Executive Officer; and Mark McCaffrey, Chief Financial Officer. Following prepared remarks, we'll open up the call for your questions. [Operator Instructions] On today's call, we'll be referencing both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures and other operating and business metrics. A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to their GAAP equivalents may be found in the presentation posted to our Investor Relations site at investors.godaddy.net or in today's earnings release on our Form 8-K furnished with the SEC. Growth rates represent year-over-year comparisons unless otherwise noted. The matters we'll be discussing today include forward-looking statements such as those related to future financial results and our strategies or objectives with respect to future operations. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed in detail in our periodic SEC filings. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today August 1, 2024. And except to the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to update these statements because of new information or future events. With that I'm pleased to introduce Aman. Aman Bhutani : Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us today. At GoDaddy, our mission is to empower everyday entrepreneurs and make opportunity more inclusive for all. Our customers are a constant source of inspiration. One customer who has been with us for over 10 years runs a recruiting services company wrote to us recently and said, in today's business environment having partners that add real value is easier said than done. I'm happy to have GoDaddy on my extended business team. That is our goal to be the extended business team for millions of micro businesses. Our strategy is relentlessly focused on creating customer value and transforming it to shareholder value through better conversion, attach and retention. Our profitable growth model drives our North Star to maximize free cash flow over the long-term. The GoDaddy team is executing against this plan to drive innovation and operational efficiency leading to our strong Q2 results. This includes meaningful expansion of free cash flow delivering 35% growth. Additionally, Applications and Commerce bookings grew 24% and normalized EBITDA margin expanded more than 400 basis points. Our key growth and margin initiatives are driven by the innovation powered by the GoDaddy software platform. Our aspiration is to deliver seamlessly intuitive experiences that start to be magical and this is fueled by GoDaddy's unique scale and data. GoDaddy Airo, our AI-powered experience is one of the results of this aspiration. I am excited about Airo's ability to reinvent multiple interactions with our customers from domain search to insights on how they can improve their websites to growing their businesses. Airo is now rolled out to all new and existing customers across our English-speaking markets and it is poised for further expansion into over 90 countries in the coming months. Airo has already transformed the experience for our new customers. In Q2, we passed an exciting milestone. Over one million new customers have discovered Airo and over 0.5 million of them actively engaged with the experience. With strong traction on discovery and engagement with new customers, the focus has moved to monetization with them. One example is the rollout of a paywall for a full website immediately after Airo has built a Coming Soon page. This rollout followed a limited controlled experiment in which Websites + Marketing conversions improved 12%. Early data also shows that Airo leads to better product retention, which we will begin to understand more fully as these cohorts enter their renewal periods in the coming quarters. In parallel, we are building the engine to connect Airo with our existing base of 21 million customers. Our approach here is a different go-to-market motion, but the goal is the same : discovery then engagement and then monetization. As we shared at our Investor Day, monetization of our base with Airo represents one of the larger future opportunities for GoDaddy. We are also investing more in GABI, our internal AI-powered guide assist bot, which can now communicate in over 60 languages. Now rolled out globally, GABI is helping our guys work and serve customers more efficiently. While our investments in Airo and GABI are about the future, 2024 growth continues to be driven by our key initiatives, pricing and bundling, seamless experience, and commerce. Pricing and bundling continued to drive growth, led by productivity and was a significant contributor to the growth in applications and commerce bookings. We have started to apply our platform data, machine learning, and experimentation capabilities to the next set of product bundles as we look at opportunities for next year and beyond. Our seamless experience initiative over performed versus our expectations as we remove friction in both purchase and renewal paths across multiple products. At our scale small improvements in conversion and renewal rates, through better user experience, and robust technology provide measurable financial results. In our continued effort to take weight away from our customers, we expanded the use of AI-generated content. For example in Managed WordPress, we have optimized templates and enhanced models to generate content for multiple pages making it easier for our customers, to build and publish websites. On commerce, we are delivering on our 2024 target of driving higher-margin subscription revenue, with the recent launch of two new SaaS plants Point-Of-Sale Plus and Invoicing Plus. These plans offer premium features and discounted transaction fees to merchants. They drive value for our customers, by offering tools that simplify their operations, including real-time inventory management, online ordering, and customizable branded templates for invoices and e-mails. Annualized GPV also continued to grow at a fast pace, with the primary driver again being conversion within our existing base of customers. In closing, we continue to deliver on our key initiatives, unlocking new avenues of growth, and value creation for the long term. The GoDaddy team shares an unwavering determination to fearlessly push boundaries and prioritize, continuously experiment meticulously track results and aim for improvement each day. I am thrilled with the speed of execution as we continue striving to exceed customer expectations propel profitable growth and create enduring shareholder value. With that, here's Mark. Mark McCaffrey : Thanks, Aman. We are pleased to announce our strong Q2 results, which demonstrate our commitment to execution and continued progress towards our North Star of maximizing free cash flow over the long term. Our North Star continues to be bolstered by two key pillars : sustained double-digit revenue growth in our Applications and Commerce segment increasing 15% in the second quarter and further expansion of our normalized EBITDA margin to 29%. We continued to build on our strong track record here delivering free cash flow of $323 million in the quarter. We also continued to implement our disciplined capital allocation strategy focusing on share buybacks and reducing our fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of the quarter to 145 million. We remain laser-focused on providing value for our customers by delivering seamless experiences that are easy to use driving better attached conversion and retention. At the same time, we continue to refine our operations to deliver profitable growth, while investing in exciting initiatives such as Airo which will provide benefits for years to come. Moving to our financial results for the quarter. Total revenue grew to $1.1 billion, up 7% on a reported and constant currency basis exceeding the high end of our guided range for the quarter. ARPU grew 6% to $210 on a trailing 12-month basis. Our customer count declined slightly to $20.9 million, reflecting the expected headwinds from our proactive divestiture and migration efforts that also impacted revenue by approximately 100 basis points. Meanwhile, our customer retention rate is an impressive 85% and over 50% of GoDaddy's customers have two or more products with us. For our high-margin Applications and Commerce segment, we drove 24% growth in bookings and 15% growth in revenue to $406 million, delivering at the high end of our guided range. Growth in revenue and bookings was largely due to the continued strong performance of our growth initiatives, across all major Applications and Commerce product offerings particularly our productivity solutions. The segment EBITDA margin improved to 44%. In addition, ARR for Applications and Commerce grew 14% to $1.5 billion. Our core platform segment delivered bookings growth of 4% and revenue growth of 3% to $719 million in line, with our guided range. Core platform's performance this quarter reflected continued strength in both primary domains up 7% and aftermarket up 10%, partially offset by hosting divestitures. Segment EBITDA margin for core platform grew to 31%. Lastly, ARR for our core platform segment was $2.3 billion, up 2%. One quick update on domains under management. This quarter, in connection with the work related to our brand migration efforts, we determined that domains under management were overstated at the end of Q4 2023 by approximately 1.4 million domains, primarily related to European TLDs. Following correction of this disclosure, coupled with the impact from the divestiture completed at the end of Q1, domains under management as of June 30 were approximately 82.1 million domains. While we understand this metric may be closely followed, this is not a key operating or financial metric and it does not impact our forecast or progress towards our North Star. Moving to profitability. Normalized EBITDA grew 25% to $332 million and delivered an expanded margin of 29%, up over 400 basis points and exceeding our guide. On bookings, we delivered 11% growth in the second quarter on a reported and constant currency basis, achieving $1.3 billion. As a reminder, bookings primarily represent the cash collected during the period. Subscription bookings grew over three points ahead of subscription revenue. Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter grew 30% to $369 million and free cash flow grew 35% to $323 million. Capital expenditures were down 52% from data center divestitures. Through July 30, we repurchased 4.1 million shares year-to-date, totaling $521 million. Cumulative shares repurchased under our current authorizations totaled $3.1 billion and 38.3 million shares. We have $915 million remaining under our current authorization. We have reduced gross shares outstanding since January 2022 by 23%, ahead of our three-year targeted reduction of 20%. We had 145 million fully diluted shares outstanding at the end of the quarter. As we have shared previously, we plan to be in the market every quarter subject to market conditions and other factors with a minimum offset to share-based compensation dilution. On our balance sheet, we finished Q2 with $445 million in cash and total liquidity of $1.4 billion. Net debt was $3.4 billion representing net leverage of 2.4x on a trailing 12-month basis. Shifting to our outlook. Given our strong performance in the first half of the year, we are raising our full year revenue guidance. We now expect the full year's revenue to be between $4.525 billion and $4.565 billion, representing growth of approximately 7% at the midpoint. We are targeting Q3 total revenue in the range of $1.13 billion to $1.15 billion also representing growth of approximately 7% at the midpoint of our range. We are also raising our expectations for Application and Commerce to deliver mid-teens growth for Q3 and the full year. In our core platform segment, we expect revenue to deliver low single-digit growth in the third quarter and full year. With our proven track record of margin expansion we are committed to maintaining our operational discipline to drive further leverage in our model. We expect normalized EBITDA margin for Q3 to be approximately 29%. Additionally, we remain on track to deliver a 31% normalized EBITDA margin in Q4 and approximately 29% for the full year. Given our nearly 1 :1 normalized EBITDA to free cash flow conversion ratio, we are also raising our unlevered free cash flow target to $1.45 billion plus and free cash flow target to $1.3 billion plus. We remain committed to our disciplined capital allocation approach and we will continue to evaluate all opportunities for shareholder return according to our rigorous returns-based framework. We have made impressive progress driving profitable growth in line with our North Star in the first half of 2024 and we remain dedicated to the path we laid out at our Investor Day executing on our strategy with a combination of durable top line growth and expanded profitability. Our substantial cash generation, strong balance sheet and disciplined capital allocation framework are important pillars of our investment thesis that create enduring value for our shareholders With that we will have Christie Masoner from our Investor Relations team open up the call for questions. A - Christie Masoner : Thanks, Mark. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Josh Beck from Raymond James. Josh, please go ahead. Josh Beck : Thank you so much for taking the question. I wanted to start with A&C bookings rising from the low to mid-20s this quarter. Maybe help us think through and unpack the major drivers. You obviously cited bundling and productivity and how those could maybe change as we look ahead? And then related anything that we need to be cognizant of when we think about comps for A&C bookings in the second half and into 2025 as well? Mark McCaffrey : Go ahead, Aman. Aman Bhutani : It's one of those I want to take. Hey, Josh thanks for the question. Super excited about the momentum in A&C bookings 24% growth. And we're bringing to the table the full power the GoDaddy scale and data as part of a GoDaddy software platform. So whether it's pricing and bundling or our seamless experience improvements or commerce obviously they are all helping A&C growth. And we're bringing these capabilities to a broader set of our product suite. So as we look into the future, we continue to be very excited about being able to implement these capabilities across our entire products in both sort of scenarios with new customers and with existing customers as well. And I'll let Mark take some of the financial pieces. Mark McCaffrey : Yes. And hi, Josh just to \u2013 we continue to see momentum across all the product groups within A&C. And for the first half of the year Q2 followed Q1 with double-digit growth in every area for bookings. When you asked about comps keep in mind Q2 compared to last year, it was an easier comp for us. So it did give us some benefit going forward as we reported this quarter. But it doesn't change the overall momentum of the bundling that's going on. Josh Beck : Super helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up on Airo, really helpful metrics. I think you mentioned one million discovered 0.5 million engaged. If we maybe double-click on that engaged group maybe what are some of the early standouts from adoption point of view? And when you think about the curve in the quarters ahead obviously, it hadn't been out that long. Is this the right cadence to think about in terms of number of customers ramping with that suite? Aman Bhutani : Yes. The new customers engaging with Airo is happening at a tremendously fast pace. I couldn't be more excited about it. I think crossing the million milestone but more importantly the engagement with the product, right? We've talked about the three-step process of discovery, engagement then monetization. And for new customers we're really seeing good news there. As I talked about in the prepared remarks we're starting to add paywalls and monetizing a little bit on the new customers. But we're going to learn a lot more about that when those customers come up for renewal, right? And you asked about the areas where we see the most engagement. One of the areas where we're seeing the most engagement is actually with website. A lot more domain customers sort of discovering the fact that GoDaddy has not just website capability, but automated AI capabilities to just build a one-page website for them, which now they can actually customize a little bit too. So customers are really I think enjoying this, and our view is that that engagement is going to sort of lead to more monetization option in the future. And then of course, we have the very large base of existing customers to bring Airo too and that's a slightly different go-to-market motion, but ultimately, it's the same discovery engagement and then monetization and sort of our energy is going to be more and more focused on the existing as the new does better and better. In terms of overall time line, it actually mirrors very well. If you go back and look at our comments rollout first with you and then with existing. So we feel pretty good about it. Josh Beck : Great to hear. Thank you, Aman and Mark. Aman Bhutani : Thank you. Mark McCaffrey : Thanks, Josh. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Trevor Young from Barclays. Trevor, please go ahead. Trevor Young : Great. Thanks. First one just on aftermarket solid double-digit growth there with -- it looks like about 20 points coming from ATV. Is the strength there becoming a bit more durable or broad-based in your view maybe extending to the larger piece of that business where it's like sub-$10000 domains? Or is it more about just a narrow few high-priced transaction skewing the trend upwards? And then what's baked in to guide for the back half of the year for aftermarket? Mark McCaffrey : Yeah. Thanks, Trevor. We're seeing strength I would say overall in the volume related to aftermarket and we've talked about that coming into the year. And obviously, it's continued through Q2. We are seeing the return of larger transactions in the first half of the year. Hard to predict. We do believe that macro impacted related to those larger transactions, but they were definitely stronger in the first half of this year versus what we saw last year. As far as the guide going forward, we continue to call what we can see in front of us. It's hard to predict those large transactions, so we don't plan on them being there in any way shape or form. And they come in kind of hard and fast and close pretty quickly when they do come in. So again, we try to be prudent and just call based on the volume we're seeing at the lower end and we continue to think that overall, this platform will be a lower single-digit grower over time, although we may see volatility from quarter-to-quarter based on some of these larger transactions. Trevor Young : That's helpful. And just as a follow-up, on the free cash flow guide, it looks like raising the unlevered free cash flow for the full year $150 million and regular free cash flow about $200 million. Can you distill the drivers of that change or rank order them? Is it the stronger flow-through of the top line or maybe stronger bookings or any onetime items to be mindful of? Mark McCaffrey : Yeah. I wouldn't say there's any one thing to call out. It is continued strong bookings continued normalized EBITDA and interest as well because we repriced some of our debt. So that's on the free cash flow part of it. But it's a combination of just better momentum across the board in translating into our free cash flow and unlevered free cash flow. Trevor Young : Great. Thank you, Mark. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Jian Li from Evercore. Jian, please go ahead. Jian Li : Great. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on a really nice quarter here. I want to circle back on the A&C bookings. Can you kind of -- is that booking strength primarily coming from the productivity pricing? Or is Airo conversion or Airo-driven conversion improvement a big part of that acceleration as well? And if you can talk a little bit about just the top of funnel that you're seeing going into A&C just given the current macro backdrop? Amanpal Bhutani : Yeah. Maybe we'll take a bit of that, Jian. Thanks for the question. On A&C, all the components of A&C as Mark said contributing to the growth. Of course, it's being led by productivity as we stated in our remarks, but GPV continues to grow very well. Our website business continued to grow very well as well. With respect to Airo, Airo even though we love the engagement and the discovery for new customers, it's still very small in terms of a contributor on the monetization side. So you're not really seeing much of Airo. And maybe I'll ask Mark to touch on that a bit more and come back to the last bit of your question. Mark McCaffrey : Yeah. And I think that's right. We are entering the monetization, but it's really early stage. It didn't have a meaningful impact on Q2. Don't have enough data points to really build in anything related to our guide or forecast related to it. But the early signs are very positive and we are starting to cross into seeing data around monetization today. Amanpal Bhutani : And then just on macro Q2 continued to be pretty steady in terms of demand coming in the door. And obviously, we have the global footprint, so it's a little bit different by region. But broadly, we would say it was a steady quarter in terms of macro. Jian Li : Got it. And if I may ask a follow-up on the margins. So the EBITDA margin beat this quarter, but you're maintaining the full year guide. Is there some sort of timing in terms of expenses like shifting to the back half? Or if you continue to see upside in margins, would you expect to flow that through to the bottom line? Or any reinvestment that you're thinking as well? Mark McCaffrey : Nothing to call out at this point. We're on a good pace. We're continuing to expand our margins as we said we would. There's nothing in particular we have to call out right now. Everything is on track and we are on track for the 31% exit rate that we had talked about at the beginning of the year. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Porter from Morgan Stanley. Elizabeth, please go ahead. Elizabeth Porter : Hi. Thank you so much. I had a quick follow-up on GABI. I noticed that you talked about GABI is highlighting that it can serve customers more efficiently. How should we think about GABI? Is it more of a cost opportunity? Or is there a chance to turn customer service to actually more into a revenue centre as guide can drive better upsell and cross-sell? Aman Bhutani : Yeah. Thanks Elizabeth. Our core ethos around whether it's GABI or all of our capabilities in Care is that we always want to provide a superior experience at the same or lower cost, right? And in GABI we're super focused on making the guide slowly into a super guide. And whether it's the service side or support side or the sales side GABI is able to partner with the guide and allow them to explore things with the customer that otherwise it may be difficult because GABI has access to a lot more data given our scale. Of course on the sales side, Care continues to drive 9% of our bookings. We get a lot of calls and we've got 14 million contacts, 6,200 guides and GABI has access to all of that information to just make the guide better and better. So you'll see both. You'll see improved customer experience and you'll see more leverage on the cost. Elizabeth Porter : Great. And then a follow-up on the A&C bookings. It sounds like momentum there can be pretty durable with multiple factors driving the growth. I'm hoping, if you could share any finer points on more specifically the pricing and bundling strategy about how broadly it's been rolled out whether from the product portfolio side or the customer base side just to understand the durability of this growth driver. Is there anything that you should roll out over the course of the year, or it could actually be a multiyear tail end? Aman Bhutani : Yeah. As we talked a little bit about in the Investor Day, Elizabeth we see the pricing and bundling initiative as a multiyear initiative for us. So while productivity is leading the way this year and other products and bundles are a little bit behind it, we expect that over the next few years we'll be able to apply the same tools and capabilities across the GoDaddy suite. It's really about capturing all the data, all the customer insight into the GoDaddy software platform being able to drive and bring the customer the unique offering that works for them. And as we do that more and more we actually think it's going to become stronger over time. So yes we're looking forward to pricing in bundle and seamless experience trying to working together over multiple years. Mark McCaffrey : Yeah. And just keep in mind too it's for new and renewals. So as renewals come up, you have the ability to sell into the existing customer base and that becomes a compounding factor. So more bundles hit more renewals, keep on going. That's why we think it's going to be a multiyear journey. Aman Bhutani : Yeah. And I think the comps will play a little bit. We're coming into some other comps in the second half of the year. But overall the way we look at the return from these tools is they're continuing to set the pace for the company where overall bookings are pacing ahead by a point or two of revenue. And that sets us up very clearly for the next year in the future as well. Elizabeth Porter : Great. Thank you so much and congrats on a strong quarter. Aman Bhutani : Thanks, Elizabeth. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Vikram Kesavabhotla from Baird. Vik, please go ahead. Vikram Kesavabhotla : Hey, can you hear me? Mark McCaffrey : Yes. Hey, Vik. Vikram Kesavabhotla : Okay. Great. Thanks. I just wanted to ask first on capital allocation. Mark, going back to the Investor Day you talked about kind of three main priorities in terms of the use of cash across repurchases, debt paydowns and acquisitions. I just wanted to clarify where do repurchases currently rank within those uses of capital today? And how do you do that in terms of priority or most attractive uses of cash flow right now? And then my second question, I wanted to put a finer point on the A&C bookings growth comments. That number has accelerated now a few quarters in a row. I realize you don't guide to a specific number on that. But as we look at the third quarter directionally, I mean should that continue to accelerate from the second quarter levels? Or should we expect it to moderate? And if you could talk through some of the puts and takes there that would be great. Thanks. Mark McCaffrey : I'll start. I'm sure Aman will add on here. On capital allocation, the strategy remains the same. We're going to look at it from quarter-to-quarter. We've laid out our North Star and our North Star continues to be our ability to generate free cash flow. And obviously, look at that on a per share basis and continue to grow that at the CAGR we set out there. Now everything we look at has to be set against that backdrop. We still believe buying back our stock is a high ROI for us and we continue to look at that from quarter-to-quarter based on other factors that are going on in the market. So, no change there. Active discussion quarter-to-quarter looking at what's out there and looking at the different opportunities that can really drive that LTV we talked about at Investor Day. On the bookings and our pace there. Now just a couple of factors. One, we expect for the year to bookings to outpace revenue by about one to two points. And that's based on the momentum we're seeing in A&C and also some of the other areas. And we think that's going to set us up nicely for 2025. But we also will get more difficult comps as we go out throughout the year. So I want to say, the pace and the momentum are there, whether the percentages move a little bit based on tougher comps, we'll see as we go out throughout the year and into 2025. But the overall pacing is still strong and we're really happy with our ability to continue to get to that second and third products within our customer base today. Vikram Kesavabhotla : Okay. Great. Thank you. Mark McCaffrey : Thanks Vik. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Arjun Bhatia from William Blair. Arjun, please go ahead. Willow Miller : Hi. I'm Willow Miller on for Arjun Bhatia. Thanks for taking our questions. So shifting gears a bit and focusing more on commerce. In your prepared remarks, you called out the new Point-of-Sale and Invoicing plus SKUs offered discount to transaction-based to merchants. Are you only offering discounted transaction fees here? Or is there opportunity for volume-based advantaged pricing in other areas to attract more and larger customers to GoDaddy payments? Aman Bhutani : Thanks Willow. As you'll probably remember, we have the best value for money in terms of payments pricing out there given the offering we bring to market. What these new SaaS plans do is they start to engage our customers into a deeper set of capabilities. So for example, with an Invoicing Plus plan customers are able to build a more custom invoice and put a logo on it or be able to e-mail that out in a very easy way. And that's us just expanding what the sort of tool set that our customers can use with GoDaddy in a very, very easy way. And on the pricing piece, we've had pricing being an advantage for us since we came out with commerce and payments. And we continue to use that advantage and we actually look at multiple avenues as we grow this business to continue to maintain that differentiator and create the value for the customer while also creating value for the company and the shareholder. Willow Miller : Great. Thanks for taking our questions. Aman Bhutani : Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Clarke Jeffries from Piper Sandler. Clarke, please go ahead. Clarke Jeffries : Hello. Thank you for taking the question. First a clarifying one. Aman, you said improved conversion by 12%. I wanted to put that into context. Is that 12% improved conversion as a measure of 100% of users in the funnel? Or is that an improvement of 12% higher dollar value? If you could just clarify that point first? Aman Bhutani : Yes. As I noted Clarke that I wanted to provide a data point of a controlled experiment. So that was an experiment in the path where a customer that buys a domain it's a coming soon page and we tried two or three different ways to provide a paywall to see which one engages the customer more. And it was the conversion from that free -- from that free coming soon page to a paid plan that increased by 12%. And that's typically on a unit basis. But the main point here is that by putting ourselves in the situation where customers are engaged with Airo, we are opening up all these new possibilities where this was a website example. But as you're aware, Airo today has nine cards that customers can engage with. And we are improving the way we engage customers across more and more of those capabilities that are just available to them when they buy a domain name. So as we get more of that engagement, we're going to continue to share with you how we are sort of stepping into the monetization. And I wouldn't over-index on any one of those pieces, it's more that how together all of those things lead to a completely different engaged customers, which we think in the long term is just very, very valuable to lifetime value. Clarke Jeffries : Understood. And then just one follow-up. You mentioned the rollout to non-English speaking countries. What is the percent of the base that is English-speaking today? I mean we have that international versus domestic breakout, but I'd imagine there is a sizable contribution there from English-speaking countries. Aman Bhutani : Yes. I don't think we've disclosed English speaking versus non, but our larger markets are English speaking. We have businesses in over -- we have customers in over 100 countries. So there is a sizable number of customers in many of those countries. There's great opportunity, because GoDaddy is still early, and we're able to bring domains customers there at our scale and with our capabilities. So we continue to be excited about what it is what we're bringing to the market. In terms of our actual English markets, our biggest markets are U.K., Canada and Australia. So those are our bigger businesses. So maybe you can do a bit of math if that's what you're looking for. Clarke Jeffries : Thank you. Aman Bhutani : Yes. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Ygal Arounian from Citi. Ygal, please go ahead. Ygal Arounian : Hey, good afternoon guys. Back to A&C looking to acceleration. We got this a lot last quarter in the translation to the top line guide in particular. At this point, we're nine points ahead on the A&C bookings acceleration or A&C bookings relative to the revenue. I understand we have some tougher comps, but how should we be thinking about how that translates to maybe why aren't we seeing it more? And on the comps, do you have us disclosed what the comps are pre-4Q of 2023? I may have missed it if you did, but could help kind of help people paint the picture to the revenue translation. Mark McCaffrey : I'll take that first half, Ygal. Just a reminder, we have transaction revenue in subscription. And then within A&C, we have a mixture of both. And we saw a good performance today this quarter in commerce, which is a transactional revenue, but we're also seeing good performance in the other areas, which are subscription. So the timing of the revenue related to the bookings acceleration can be anywhere from immediately within the quarter to over a period of time and will start to contribute to revenue as we go out through further quarters. So we saw some contribution this quarter. We'll continue to see that as we get to the rest of this year. And obviously, in 2025, we'll have momentum going in there. But remember, it's a combination of both right? So we can hit in different periods depending on the nature of the bundle the transaction or the combination of the products they buy. Aman Bhutani : And just Ygal on the bookings numbers for A&C at least, I believe you should have Q3 and Q4 but you can always take it offline. Ygal Arounian : Okay. And then on the bundling. So, understanding productivity is the focus now and then there's more after is coming in the future. Maybe just a hit on what's next in the pipeline if you can? I guess, that's going to come over time. But we hear mostly about e-mail and security. Any more details around some of the key bundles that you expect to roll out I think would be really helpful. Thank you. Aman Bhutani : Ultimately, we want to go across the board, right? Like the approach is really about the customer and not about the product, right? We're trying to create this value for the customer and their whole relationship with us. So, all the products are going to sort of see something over the next year or two. Not making any promises on it but some of the products in A&C that we're very excited about is for example the websites business. Just a couple of days completely unrelated to us tech-grade ARPU named Airo as the number one AI website builder for micro businesses. So we're definitely getting some momentum in that business. And with Airo, we think there's some great opportunity there. But that's not the only one. Our other products many of them are at significant scale and will lend themselves well to bundling in different ways. Mark McCaffrey : Yes. The advantage we have now with the consolidated technology stack is we have the ability to see what bundles really are attractive to our customers and we're starting to analyze that data and that starts to give us a path forward. Airo only helps that even further as we look at the behaviors and the engagement and allows us to start to position those bundles as to what value we can give to the customers. Aman Bhutani : Yes. And there is a little bit of an order of operations Ygal where we have to hit certain renewal cycles to be able to see the customer behavior, right? So, it's not the thing that we can everything happen on in one quarter, one day. There is a progression of this program working over the next two, three years, getting to the real value for our customers. Ygal Arounian : Great. Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Alex [indiscernible] from UBS. Alex, please go ahead. Chris Kuntarich : Hi, you got Chris on the line. Just maybe going back to the attach comments in a couple of quarters now that you've said that over 50% of customers have two-plus products. Just curious if you could put a finer point on existing customers versus new customers? Are the new customers -- do they have a higher propensity to go to two, four, four plus type of attach versus the existing base? Aman Bhutani : Yes. Chris we're very excited about the Airo offering, right? We're engaging customers with a lot more products right away. But the metric that Mark talks about is that's paid products. So, what we'll see happen is as we engage customers across these products when they come to those renewal cycles we expect to see sort of that number continuing to grow. But broadly our new customers adding more products has been a good trend for us. Mark McCaffrey : And this has been something that's building over time. I think the metric we gave out at the end of the year was a customer new customer attach at rate 25% faster than they were three, four years ago. And that trend continues, right? Our customers are coming in with intent. They're engaging at different levels. And just to hit on the finer point that Aman said, we count that two-plus product when they pay, not when they engage. And that means it can come into a renewal it can come after a free trial. So, it takes time but they are definitely engaging at a higher level rate than we saw in the past. Chris Kuntarich : Got it. Very helpful. And maybe just one follow-up on A&C incremental margins. It has been a couple of quarters where you're over 60% smaller [Technical Difficulty]. It really seems like you guys are sticking to a very cost control approach here. Any reason why this may be one-off here and not the right way to be thinking about it over the medium term? Mark McCaffrey : There's nothing to call out on a one-off basis. This is just the three things we had talked about that would drive our profitability going forward. A&C growing which is our higher-margin business and being more of the pie over time will create a tailwind to our overall normalized EBITDA margin. As we start to tap into global talent pool, we'll use GABI more of that will create leverage within our P&L up and down. And then we continue our journey on operational simplification. We're trying to make sure we're fit for purpose going forward that we're agile and we continue to have that ability to not only invest in the business and invest in new technology, but have an efficient back-office operations. So, those three pillars still remain intact. And what we're seeing now is the A&C bookings and growth really becoming that tailwind that we had talked about coming into the year. Chris Kuntarich : Thanks Mark. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Naved Khan from B. Riley. Naved, please go ahead. Hey Naved, you're muted. Naved Khan : Yes, thanks. Can you hear me now? Christie Masoner : We can. Naved Khan : So apologies if somebody already asked this. I jumped on a little late. But a question I have is on your 3Q guidance specifically on the EBITDA guide. Why are you guiding to a compression in margins quarter-on-quarter? And also given that A&C continues to be the bigger piece of the business and that's the higher-margin business. So just kind of unpack that for me? And then I have a follow-up. Mark McCaffrey : Yes. I think we're happy on -- with our margin expansion through the year. We continue to look at opportunities and look at product mix and how the momentum is moving. We overperformed in Q2 on our margin. We believe that will continue into Q3 at the same levels. And obviously, we talked about our Q4 exit rate will remain at the 31% keeping us at 29% for the year. Because our bookings are doing well and obviously, we talked about our raise in our guidance related to revenue, a lot of that percentage falls to the bottom line on an absolute dollar and allows us to feel good about raising our free cash flow and unlevered free cash flow guidance as well. Naved Khan : Got it. And then Aman, on your comments about now having like nine cards and Airo I think you started with maybe 5 or 6, if I remember correctly. Have you seen an improvement in conversion every time you add a card and then optimize the experience around that? Just give us some color around these launches and what the effect is on conversions on attach rates? Aman Bhutani : Now they're picking on a really interesting thing where as we introduce more, we've got to be very careful to keep the experience simple for our customers. So actually there are a number of experiments that continue to evolve what the cards look like to get higher engagement with the customers. There's all sorts of different things from cards disappearing to changing the order to growing out to saying it's done. The teams are trying lots and lots of different combinations. And frankly there is more we want to include in Airo. And only when we make this simpler can we add the new things. So yes, that's a constant area of focus for us, but it's also the beauty of our scale, right? We have a breadth of products that we can bring to our customers. That's a lot of value we can pack in with a humble domain name. And if we can get the discovery and the engagement we can get the monetization. And at our scale we're doing lots and lots of experiments. We have teams that are well trained in understanding how to do this work well. And we're pretty excited about it. That's one of the reasons as Mark likes to say that Airo might be small today and it's not in our guide, but we are very excited about what it represents in the future for us. Naved Khan : So maybe just sort of to follow up on that. If I ask you, where are you on that journey with Airo if it's a 9-inning game? How would you kind of place yourself? Aman Bhutani : We are in an early inning, Naved. Mark McCaffrey : I was going to say we're in the first pitch, right? So there's a lot to go and a lot of exciting things going on there. Naved Khan : Excellent. Thank you, guys. Christie Masoner : Thank you. That concludes our Q&A. I'll turn the call back to Aman for closing remarks. End of Q&A: Aman Bhutani : Thank you, Christie. Thank you all for joining and a quick shot out to all GoDaddy employees for Airo being named the number one website builder just recently. And I think it sets a great tone for us at the company. It's always good to see somebody recognize our work. So thank you very much and we'll see you next quarter.",

Our strategy is relentlessly focused on creating customer value and transforming it to shareholder value through better conversion, attach and retention. This is the driving force behind our profitable growth model, propelling us towards our north star of maximizing free cash flow over the long-term. Our strong Q3 results demonstrate our effective execution of this strategy, delivering both innovation and operational efficiency. We drove meaningful growth in free cash flow increasing 29% year-over-year, and application and commerce bookings were up 20% and normalized EBITDA margin expanded by over 400 basis points. We are excited to share updates on our growth and margin initiatives driving success in 2024. Pricing in bundling, seamless experience, commerce and cost optimization are all ahead of schedule, driving the strong results mentioned. The enthusiasm for GoDaddy Airo continues to vibrate within our teams. And along with an update today, we are looking forward to more live demos at our investor dinner in early December. Pricing and bundling continues to deliver solid results with productivity-focused efforts remaining a key contributor to the 20% application and commerce bookings growth this quarter. As we have said before, we view the pricing and bundling initiative as a multiyear journey that leverages our software platforms, vast data and machine learning capabilities allowing us to bundle solutions in a way that offers greater value to customers with pricing aligned to the value delivered. While our efforts this year have been concentrated on productivity solutions, we will expand the initiative across more of our product suite, extending this initiative beyond the application and commerce segment. Putting a finer point on this, this means the financial impact of pricing and bundling can favorably drive growth in both A&C and Core platform segments starting in Q4. Our seamless experience initiative exceeded expectations as we continue to remove friction in the customer experience and improve purchase, onboarding and renewal path. Given our scale, even modest improvements in conversion and renewal can yield meaningful results. In Managed WordPress, we added security enhancements to all new domains attached to the platform as well as expanded AI-powered features, making it easier for customers to build and manage their websites. Additionally, with the recent launch of the GoDaddy Digital Marketing Suite, we are giving customers an intuitive all in one product to help grow and market their businesses regardless of where their website is hosted. Features like these empower our customers to better acquire, engage and expand their own customer base. For our commerce initiative, we continue to enhance our offering by introducing new AI-powered features that simplify operations for merchants. The two new SaaS plans we launched last quarter, Point-Of-Sale Plus and Invoicing Plus have had positive adoption trends since being fully rolled out. We have set aggressive attached targets, and the team is making progress against them. Finally, within our cost optimization initiative, we augmented care interactions in 20 international markets with our new generative AI-powered conversational bot providing our customers with better instant self-service access to solutions for common issues. We found that use of this technology led to double-digit improvement in containment rates, representing a savings of over 16 million incremental contact minutes without sacrificing customer satisfaction. We are excited with the progress on the conversational bot and along with GABI, we expect these to continue to drive leverage in care while delivering a better experience globally. And Airo is starting to provide a magical experience to customers that we aspire to provide across every interaction. It is a compelling proof point to our multiple year journey to successfully leverage our software platform and unleash the combined power of our infrastructure, large-scale data, experimentation, AI and machine learning capabilities. With the capabilities of Airo, we evolved the domain to represent so much more. It is now a gateway to a true business-in-a-box experience, allowing our customers to go from idea to online in minutes. Our teams are moving at a fast pace even before celebrating the one-year anniversary of the initial customer testing for Airo, it was available in over 180 countries globally. Nearly 3 million customers have discovered Airo with over half of them engaging with the experience. We are pleased with the momentum in discovery and engagement and just as exciting are the proof points we are driving in Airo monetization. With many months of data, we can clearly see that the largest engagement winner is website building. Over half of engaged users published a coming soon page, which is a customizable one page website. Customers engaged with Airo are quickly becoming the largest funnel for websites plus marketing with over 40% of websites plus marketing paid subscriptions in Q3 originating with the Airo experience. Our goals with Airo are about discovery, engagement and monetization. And with these large discovery and engagement numbers and multiple paths to monetization, Airo is off to a great start. And there is so much more we can do given the positive traction we are eager to expand the Airo experience across all on-ramps at GoDaddy, and we plan to increase investment in marketing initiatives to support this broader launch. So far, the customer exposed to Airo starts with a domain purchase. And in the next few weeks, we will start rolling out Airo to customers that start with a website purchase. Just as websites have become the highest attached product for domains on Airo, we expect to drive attach with other products when every website customer starts with an Airo experience. This underscores our commitment to rapidly scaling products enabled by Airo as it continues to transform the customer experience and drive new avenues of growth. We look forward to showing you more during our upcoming investor dinner event on December 3. We plan to showcase paid tiers for Airo with premium offerings like advanced logos and imagery as well as AI-powered marketing tools to help our customers grow their businesses. Equally exciting, we will highlight our conversational experience to building and maintaining word press sites, which reimagines harnessing the power of WordPress through a simplified intuitive interface. We will also demo our site optimizer tool, which can inspect any website and provide actionable recommendations to improve performance with just a click. While these products themselves will be brand new, they represent our continued focus on leveraging AI and machine learning and our unique scale and data to deliver magical seamless experiences for our customers. We are thrilled to give you a first look at these innovations that will drive our growth and success in the future. In closing, we remain steadfastly focused on executing our key growth initiatives. I am delighted with the speed of execution and our relentless commitment to help our customers thrive. The GoDaddy team remains dedicated to propel profitable growth and create enduring shareholder value. With that, here's Mark. Mark McCaffrey : Thanks, Aman. We delivered strong Q3 results, demonstrating our disciplined execution of the strategy we shared at our recent Investor Day. Our focus on building increasing customer lifetime value through developing and delivering seamless technology that drives conversion, attach and retention is demonstrated in our financial results. In the third quarter, we drove sustained double-digit A&C revenue growth, increasing 16% as well as impressive normalized EBITDA margin expansion to 32%. We made progress toward our North Star, growing free cash flow 29% to $363 million. In addition, we continued to execute our disciplined capital allocation strategy, which focused on share buybacks, reducing our fully diluted shares outstanding to $144 million. Total revenue grew to $1.15 billion, up 7% on a reported and constant currency basis. For our high-margin A&C segment, we drove 20% growth in bookings and 16% growth in revenue to $423 million, in line with our guided range on the strong performance of the growth initiatives Aman spoke about earlier. The segment EBITDA margin for A&C improved to 46% on the strength of our high gross margin proprietary solutions partially offset by the strong performance and lower gross margin profiles of our commerce offerings and third-party solutions. A&C segment EBITDA was also boosted by significant leverage gains across all operating expenses. Our proactive effort to simplify our infrastructure and recruit global talent were the main driving factors behind this strength. In addition, ARR for Applications & Commerce grew 15% to $1.6 billion. We delivered $725 million of revenue for our Core Platform segment representing growth in revenue and bookings of 3%, in line with our guided range. Performance this quarter reflected the strength in primary domains partially offset by hosting divestitures and end-of-life migrations. Segment EBITDA margin for the Core Platform grew to 33% and ARR for our Core Platform segment grew 4% to $2.4 billion. ARPU grew 8% to $215 on a trailing 12-months basis, while our customer count declined slightly to $20.7 million. With the previously mentioned divestiture and migration efforts behind us, we expect to return to customer growth in 2025. Currently, our consolidated customer retention rate remains at 85% and over 50% of our customers have two or more paid products with us. Moving to profitability. We drove expansion in normalized EBITDA in the third quarter, growing 24% and to $367 million and delivering an expanded margin of 32%, up over 400 basis points. This was driven by the gross margin tailwind noted above, coupled with operational discipline that drove leverage in our P&L. The front-loaded benefits of our 2023 restructuring, infrastructure simplification and global talent recruitment are evident, and we are pleased with these accomplishments. As we look forward, we remain on track to deliver our Investor Day targets of approximately 33% by 2026. Additionally, as we look to the upcoming quarters, we expect to increase investment in marketing to support our broader launch of our Airo enabled solutions to showcase our top-rated AI website builder and capture customer demand. On bookings, we delivered $1.2 billion in the third quarter representing 9% growth on both a reported and a constant currency basis. As a reminder, bookings primarily represents the cash collected during the period. Subscription bookings grew 2 points ahead of subscription revenue. Unlevered free cash flow for the quarter grew 25% to $399 million, and free cash flow grew 29% to $363 million. Capital expenditures were down approximately 46% because of data center divestitures. Through October 28, we repurchased 5.2 million shares year-to-date, totaling $668 million. We repurchased 39.4 million shares for $3.2 billion under our current authorizations, and we have $767 million remaining. We drove a 23% reduction in gross shares outstanding since January 2022, 3 points ahead of our three-year targeted reduction of 20%. At the quarter end, 144 million fully diluted shares remain outstanding. On our balance sheet, we finished Q3 with $767 million in cash and total liquidity of $1.8 billion. Net debt was $3.1 billion, representing a net leverage of 2x on a trailing 12-month basis. Pivoting to our outlook. We are raising the full-year revenue guide to $4.545 billion to $4.565 billion, representing growth of approximately 7% at the midpoint of our range. For the fourth quarter, we are targeting revenue between $1.165 billion and $1.185 billion, also representing growth of approximately 7% at the midpoint. In Applications & Commerce, we expect mid-teens revenue growth for Q4 and the full-year. In Core Platform, we expect low single-digit revenue growth in the fourth quarter and the full-year. As our track record demonstrates, we are committed to maintaining our operational discipline driving further operational leverage in our model and expanding margins. Including the additional marketing investment we expect to make in the fourth quarter, we remain on course to deliver a 31% normalized EBITDA margin. Given our year-to-date performance, we are also raising our full-year normalized EBITDA expectation to 30%, keeping in mind our nearly 1 :1 normalized EBITDA to free cash flow conversion ratio, we are also raising our unlevered free cash flow target to $1.475 billion plus and free cash flow to $1.325 billion plus for the full-year. Our disciplined capital allocation approach remains unchanged, and we will evaluate all opportunities for shareholder return according to our rigorous and returns-based framework. We are committed to the path we outlined at our Investor Day, executing our strategy to deliver both durable top line growth and expanded profitability as we drive toward our North Star. Our robust cash generation, strong balance sheet and capital allocation framework underpin our investment thesis and power our ability to create enduring value for our shareholders. We are pleased with our progress towards our Investor Day target of $4.5 billion plus in cumulative free cash flow generation supported by 6% to 8% annual revenue growth and expansion of our normalized EBITDA margin to 33% by 2026. Lastly, we look forward to welcoming you to our annual investor dinner on December 3 in our new Tempe, Arizona headquarters. I will now turn the call over to our Vice President and Head of Investor Relations, Christie Masoner, to open the call for your questions. A - Christie Masoner : Thanks, Mark. [Operator Instructions]. [Technical Difficulty] Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, thanks. Can you hear me? Aman Bhutani : Yes. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, great. Thanks. Hey, I wanted to ask two questions about the Applications & Commerce segment. The first one is on bookings growth. Yes, I realize you don't guide to that metric, but just wondering if you could give us any thoughts on how that could track in the fourth quarter this year and some of the puts and takes we should be considering for bookings growth as we go through the rest of the year. And then second, this is your third straight quarter now of Applications & Commerce, bookings growth of 20% or higher. And so I'm wondering if you could remind us of the relationship between that metric and forward revenue growth for that segment and some of the puts and takes that influence the conversion there. And specifically, if I go back to the Investor Day, you talked about this segment being a low to mid-teens type of revenue grower. But just given the bookings momentum that you've seen to date, should we be thinking about a higher level of growth in the near term for that segment? It would be great to get any thoughts on those topics, and I'll leave it there. Thanks. Mark McCaffrey : Thanks, Vik. And a couple of things, right? One, yes, bookings acceleration can be a tailwind for us in revenue. So that is a factual statement. Things to consider when we're really looking at the difference between the two is the timing with -- especially with our A&C, we have multiple different timing depending on the product mix within that group. For example, transactional and commerce. We have monthly terms. We have annual terms. We have multiyear terms. Do you really have to look at it on a broad spectrum of what products are being sold, what the mix is. And yes, it will help our -- be a tailwind for us on revenue in general. We're really excited about the momentum. Obviously, we'll talk a little bit more when we get to the Q4 earnings call about 2025. But we're comfortable with the 6% to 8% growth we talked about over the three years. We do think for the year, overall bookings will outpace revenue by about 2 points and that is obviously being pushed a lot by the A&C. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. Thank you. Mark McCaffrey : Thanks, Vik. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Trevor Young from Barclays. Trevor, please go ahead. Trevor Young : Great, thanks. First, just on the pricing and bundling going forward. I think you made comments that it's an opportunity near term in Core Platform. Can you expand upon that a little bit? Should we assume that, that's going to happen in some of the bigger line items such as domains? And then second question, aftermarket growth slowed quite a bit in 3Q, kind of flattish year-on-year versus double-digits earlier in the year. Was that consistent with your expectations? And was there anything kind of onetime there? I know it's very transactional in nature, so tough to predict, but just any color on what's going on in aftermarket would be helpful. Aman Bhutani : Thanks, Trevor. I can take the pricing in one-line approach. As we've talked about, pricing and bundling is about finding the right cohorts of customers, where we can provide the right value to customers and then price along with that value. And the way we do this is that we experiment at different price points of find the price elasticity curve. And then what that curve helps us do is find the right cohorts where we can sort of balance attrition for customers, right, or let's say, retention of customers with the pricing opportunity in front of us. And that's a great balance. Right at the company, we want to drive as much growth as we can while maintaining our high customer retention rates. So for pricing and bundling, that approach of using machine learning, using experimentation, using the scale of our data and our competitive advantages there, we can direct that way of working across our product suite and cohorts within that product suite. So what we're really -- what I'm really talking about here is that we have identified other cohorts of customers that we will be applying this approach to. And some of those are going to have products that sit in the Core Platform, which is now going to take sort of the benefit of pricing and bundling across both the segments. Mark McCaffrey : And Trevor on aftermarket, yes. Just a reminder, it's a volatile business. We think over time, it will be a low single-digit dollar. And we always talk about there could be volatility from quarter-to-quarter. This quarter, it was down slightly. Nothing to call out in and of itself. We saw some pressure on valuations at the lower level, all of the demand seem to continue. And again, we don't control the pricing on the aftermarket. It's a buyer to seller green pricing. So again, thesis still holds. We believe it will be a low single-digit grower over time, and we'll see a little bit of variability in the quarter-to-quarter and we'll just call it out. Trevor Young : Great, thank you both. Mark McCaffrey : Thanks. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Ken Wong from Oppenheimer. Ken, please go ahead. Ken Wong : Can you guys hear me? Okay. Christie Masoner : Yes. Ken Wong : Okay, perfect. I just wanted to just touch on an earlier statement that you made in terms of resuming customer acquisition in 2025. Was that just generally meant as a sort of as you anniversary the divestitures? Or should we assume a heavier pace of investments in '25 to kind of pursue a more attractive growth opportunity? Mark McCaffrey : Yes. So the first part of it is, yes, it was just to call out that we are lapping the divestitures, the integrations and the end-of-life we've talked about previously. And as we start to lap them throughout this year, net customer adds will have -- that headwind will go away. And Aman, if you want to comment on the marketing, what we talked about. Aman Bhutani : Yes. Look, we're super excited, Ken, about the product portfolio we have in play right now, brought together by Airo, just an almost magical experience for our customers. We've got the product rolled out, we've always had sort of very good guardrails for our marketing spend. But given the product offering that we have, there's an opportunity for us to spend up in marketing, and we do expect to get more customers as a result of that. And like Mark said, there is a normalization of the divestitures and some of the actions we've taken. It also includes some actions that we took with viral offers that we have out there, and we're going to lapse on that too. Ken Wong : Got it. And then maybe a quick follow-up on a similar question to Vikram. A&C ARR accelerated on a tougher comp. Is that something we could continue to see considering the pace of A&C bookings at that 20% level? Mark McCaffrey : Yes. So higher level, obviously, as we go into Q4 and into 2025, the strength of A&C will get harder to compare to. So on a percentage basis, we like the momentum overall that will continue. But obviously, the percentage comps get a little harder as we go on into next year. Aman Bhutani : And just to confirm, I think you have the sort of A&C comparatives from last year for Q3 and Q4, and you can see the sort of step up in Q4 comps that happens. Ken Wong : Perfect. Thank you guys. Aman Bhutani : Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Ygal Arounian from Citi. Ygal, please go ahead. Ygal Arounian : Hey guys, good afternoon. Aman Bhutani : Hey, Ygal. Ygal Arounian : Great to see some of the early starting points with Airo and Aman, you called out some of these things around the engagement that we're seeing. Last quarter, you talked about -- start to put in some paywalls testing around that. I want to see how that's progressing and then maybe kind of connecting the dots with the engagement and the expectations around moving in into the starting point of the website piece versus the domain piece. And are you starting to see a real kind of financial results, presumably if -- what was it 40% of what's that spot marketing subscriptions are originating with Airo? That means yes. But maybe just help us understand that a little bit better. Aman Bhutani : Yes. Thanks, Ygal. So the progress with Airo goes on a time line of discovery, engagement and monetization. And Discovery is about getting Airo in front of as many customers as possible and getting them to just discover that GoDaddy has a breadth of products available to them. The engagement piece is about getting them to engage in some of those products. And you'll remember that we call those Airo cards, getting customers to click on them, engage with them, set something up. And we're seeing really good traction on discovery and engagement. And what we did over the last quarter or two is that we started to put up paywalls where along with that engagement, if, for example, a customer got a coming soon page and wanted -- and was able to customize it a little bit, if they wanted to do more a paywall would appear and say, you need to buy subscription or websites plus marketing. Now it is possible that, that customer would have bought it anyway, two months, three months down the line, and we would have gotten that attach. But what Airo offers is the ability for us to paywall right there, get the customer to make that decision. And that paywall is actually connected to the 40% that I talked about today. And what that is about is that Airo is becoming a bigger and bigger on-ramp for our website products. And today, we have two in Airo. We have a coming soon page is doing really well and we have websites plus marketing subscription. And as Airo becomes a bigger on-ramp, Yes, of course, we're happy to see that monetization happens, but what that opens up in the future is paywalls an opportunity to sell other products because we do see in the customer behavior that customers have a need for the other offerings that we have. It's just that today, they don't discover those offerings. They don't engage with those offerings, and they definitely don't see a monetization for it. But Airo is going to let us do that, which is follow the customers, they have those subsequent needs with the paywalls in front of them. So this website paywall story is a very good story. It's a new -- it's, of course, an only story, and it's the first big one for Airo. But we have similar work in logos. We have similar work in images. These are things we're going to demo at the investor dinner. We have some work happening with palings that come with Airo and a couple of the others as well. Ygal Arounian : Okay. Great. And maybe one more on the bundling initiatives. Still, I think, if I'm understanding correctly, still majority focused on the productivity suite. You called out a few specific products in the past quarters. Maybe if you could update us on where you are within productivity? And could we expect to see that come out with commerce in the coming quarter or two? Thank you guys. Aman Bhutani : Yes. Our pricing and bundling, the folks working on it really have the ability to test across various customer cohorts and what they're looking for are the cohorts where we can generate the best results fastest. And the best result here means creating that customer value, and then being able to monetize that value as well. So when I look across our products, we have other products to go that are much larger in terms of the base of customers. So we think that those likely are going to offer some of the better opportunities, but we'll keep you informed just like we did with productivity. I think you remember last year, we did apply this thinking to multiple products. And then we said, what you're going to see stronger or a large chunk of the return come from productivity, because we're going to zone in on that because that's where we see the opportunity. Similarly, as we go over the next few quarters, we'll sort of guide you better on where we're seeing that return. But our testing this year as we plan for next year is going well. And one of the things that we have shared today is that we see ourselves going across customer cohorts that now will be in A&C and in Core. So you'll likely see a little bit different behavior going into next year than you did this year. Ygal Arounian : Got it. Thank you so much. Aman Bhutani : Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Arjun Bhatia from William Blair. Arjun, please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, everyone. I'm Willow on for Arjun Bhatia. Thanks for taking our question. So just wanted to ask on macro questions. Last year, you called out you're seeing stability in your base. Can you comment if you're seeing any changes here? And then also comment on any impact to net new as well, please? Aman Bhutani : Yes. Overall, on the macro, we track the metrics I think we've talked about before and sort of, if I look at my dashboard, generally, we see some good, but we're keeping a close eye on things, specially election in the U.S. coming off. But broadly speaking, what I would say is when we think about our customer base, and Mark always likes to talk about our high attention, and I'm sure you will jump in with that. We're absolutely proud of that. But when we look at traffic coming in the door, we continue to see good gross adds. We continue to see good traffic coming to the site. And in pockets and those pockets can be geographic, those pockets can be sort of different customer segments. In pockets where we do see some sort of weakness, that's more than made up by how we've improved conversion, how we've improved pricing, all the sort of mechanics that we're applying within our seamless experience initiative. So I feel if there are a few, those are more than overcome. But broadly speaking, we continue to get good traffic, continue to get good gross adds and continue to maintain our higher retention rate for customers at 85%. Mark McCaffrey : Yes. And just to add, when you take out the divestitures, when you take out the decisions we made around virals, and we look at the strong top of the funnel, what we are seeing is customers coming in with intent and how are we seeing it? Well, our ARPU is increasing, our ARPU is being driven by higher average order sizes from our customers when they initiate with us at the beginning. We see our customers attaching overall at a faster rate than they did years ago. So when you really peel through the ins and the outs of the customers, take out the divestitures, turn off the virals, we're seeing very strong behavior with intent at the front of the funnel. Now we are always subject things like valuations in aftermarket, and we've talked about that a lot, but the overall behavior of the funnel and the attachment is strong. Unidentified Analyst : Got you. That's helpful. And one more follow-up, if I may. Can you comment on the bookings growth. So it looks like for A&C, it decelerated quarter-to-quarter. It seems like customer strength is good and pricing of that were continuing [indiscernible] take deceleration. If I can understand it better? Mark McCaffrey : So I heard the deceleration part there, and I'll address that. And maybe if you can -- if you had another part to that, let me know it was cutting out. So on the deceleration, it's tougher comps. We went from Q2 comparison in '23 to Q3 comparison in '23. It was just the most difficult comps. The momentum in and of itself is the same. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. That answers my questions. Thanks. Mark McCaffrey : All right. Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Elizabeth Porter from Morgan Stanley. Elizabeth, please go ahead. Mark McCaffrey : Hey, Elizabeth. Elizabeth Elliott : Hi, thanks so much. I wanted to just circle back on the pricing and bundling expanding into the core platform in Q4. And when we think about the A&C segment, you guys saw a big improvement with this strategy and kind of growth there almost doubled. So how should we think about the benefit unfolding for the core segment where this bookings have been a little bit more muted in the 3% to 4% range? Is there anything we should consider about the opportunity in core being larger or smaller than what you saw with productivity? Aman Bhutani : Yes, Elizabeth. It's a little too early to sort of putting numbers on it. But we will definitely talk more about it in the next quarter's call and from there. Generally speaking, our approach is the same. The way we're using the data, the way we're cohorting customers, the way we're testing the price elasticity curve, the way we're creating it, the way we sort of decide where to go on it. All of that methodology is similar, but it takes us really sort of getting into that customer cohort in a few weeks of executing that plan to really see what it's going to be. What we do see so far is that we are ready to start on it in Q4, but likely it will take a quarter or more for us to get that run rate going where we can talk about it with a little bit more data than we have today. Mark McCaffrey : Yes. And Elizabeth, nothing to change what we've put out there as guidance for Q4. We're talking about the initial steps of it, and then we'll talk about 2025 when we get to the fourth quarter earnings call. Elizabeth Elliott : Understood. Thanks. And then as a follow-up, I wanted to touch on the margin side. You referenced in the prepared remarks just increasing marketing initiatives to support the broader launch of Airo. Is that the main factor driving some of the margin contraction to 31% in Q4 from 32% in Q3? Is there anything else to call out? And then what are some of the puts and takes set up more broadly as we think into next year? What are some of the key levers that can offset increased marketing spend around ARL? Mark McCaffrey : Yes. Thanks, Elizabeth. And just a couple of high level comments. In Q3, we benefited from a favorable product mix. Generally, we think our gross margins are going to be around 64%, give or take a 100 basis points. We saw a favorable mix within Q3. We saw -- for example, aftermarket was down about 1%, and that's a lower margin business for us. As we see our higher margin proprietary software be a better part of the mix. Our margins will lean towards the high side. If we see transactional having strength, we'll see that towards lowers on. So again, there will be product mix in there that will determine or impact on the gross margin. We had seen some front-loaded benefits from some of the restructuring simplification efforts we had, global recruitment we talked about hit into Q3. Those were front-end loaded and we'll continue to see those. And then the rest is what we alluded to was the timing. We just had timing of expenses like marketing that we'll see start to pick up a little more in Q4, still on target for the 31% we talked about, but some of that was just the timing and the expenses and how they're hitting. Elizabeth Elliott : Got it. Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Josh Beck from Raymond James. Josh, please go ahead. Josh Beck : Yes. Thank you so much for the question. I wanted to go back to some of the Airo comments realizing that you kind of had this discover, engage, monetize framework. So I think the discovery element of it was up maybe 3x quarter-over-quarter to $3 million. So is that, when we think about the marketing spend that Elizabeth just asked about, is that really the key metric that we should be thinking about in terms of it really ramping up in the year? And is there some type of maybe not specific goal, but could it reach a pretty sizable, could it be half of your base? Just curious on how we should be considering that. Aman Bhutani : Thanks, Josh. Discovery is definitely an important metric, because without the discovery metric we can't feel confident that our customers are seeing the breadth of our products, both new and existing products. But if you had to sort of fall in on one metric and say, hey, which is the one that we really are focused on optimizing on. It's really the engagement metric that we want to keep very, very healthy, and it is very, very healthy, because as we spend in marketing, discovery will definitely go up, but we don't want engagement as a percentage of drop downs. We want customers engage with this because we have data for 25 years, and we know just from our own data and the data of other companies that the engaged customers enter the monetization phase in a much more favorable manner than non-engaged customers, right? Metrics like attached conversion, do much, much better for engaged users than they do for non-engaged users. So that's if you will, that is the quality metric. That's the thing that makes sure that our efforts are valuable and are going to create more value in the future. While I'm very happy about the multiple paths monetization for Airo, and we'll show you the paywalls and the teams are doing good stuff. And the website paywall doing well and even sort of monetization on coming soon and other being great opportunities for us. I would say, overall, in our three year plan at the Investor Day earlier this year, we purposefully put Airo outside of the three year planning, because we wanted to build a very large mode of discovery and engagement. Because that very large mode of discovery and engagement will, we believe, generate sort of recurrence for years to come. Josh Beck : Super helpful. And then I also wanted to follow-up on this stat around double-digit containment rate improvements, I think with these GenAI bots, which I assume is something similar to a deflection rate. I wanted to clarify that. And could that be a much larger number over time and at some point, could you see benefits with respect to the P&L? Just curious how we can think about maybe where that could head? Aman Bhutani : Yes. containment rate is like a deflection rate. It really points to the sessions where a customer asked the question and the conversational bot was able to answer the customer's question in a satisfactory manner, and that been resolved in sort of a chat being forwarded to a human agent. So seeing that sort of double-digit percentage increase in the bot being able to resolve the customer query or issues is a great first step. And look, of course, whether it's this or our guide assist part, which we call GABI, these are relatively new technologies. They're off to a great start we see great momentum in those over the next two to three years. It's our sort of our -- sort of ethos around this, and I've talked about this often. But in care, we want to provide a better experience at a lower cost. So our expectation is that care is a line item will continue to leverage, and we will continue to provide a better and better and better experience for our customers. And one of the ways that we're doing that is by having better technology in care. That makes our guides more successful, that makes our customers more successful, and while retaining some of the secret sauce of care that we have as a company. Josh Beck : Really helpful. Thanks so much. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Ella Smith on for Alexi Gogolev at JPMorgan. Ella please go ahead. Aman Bhutani : Hey, Ella. Ella Smith : Hi, Aman. Hi, Mark. Hi, Christie. Hope you are all doing well. So first, I have yet another question on Airo for you. So Aman, Airo is clearly a powerful open to all gram for new customers and it's clearly driving bookings. How are you balancing that with your ambitions to monetize the products? And when might monetization begin? Aman Bhutani : Ella, thanks for the question. We -- our first goal is to being the largest mode of discovery and engagement. We want to be able to spend against Airo and build a virtuous cycle, a flywheel, if you will, where customers get care about Airo. They come in, they discover the set of products we have and they engage and buy into those products. That has a really good flywheel effect where it drives average order size up and it allows us to bid more in marketing to bring more customers to our site, right? And that's a lovely flywheel that can build on itself. So that's the first thing that we're trying to build in. And for us, the way to build it well is to focus on discovery and engagement and then monetization. In terms of monetization, absolutely super excited about it. Our teams are -- in fact, I would say, ahead on some of the monetization experiments versus what we had originally designed. It's great to see our become a great on-ramp for websites plus marketing. We wanted to become a great on-ramp for other products, too. Great. But it has to follow the discovery and engagement cycle, because I would love to be able to sit here and give you numbers on discovery and engagement that are much larger than where we are today. And these numbers are pretty large and fantastic as is, but I think they can be much bigger. Mark McCaffrey : Yes. And I think when you think about our overall framework, we're always trying to make sure we're heading towards our North Star that we talk about free cash flow. And that means balancing our investments with where we see the return and making sure we're doing it to drive LTV and shareholder value over the longer term without trying to push ourselves into a specific area too quickly that would basically jeopardize that over the long term. Ella Smith : That makes a lot of sense. Thank you both so much. And as -- and for my follow-up, we saw news at the end of the day that you launched a reseller program. Can you shed some light on the strategic thinking around that program and how the economics will look like? Aman Bhutani : Yes. The reseller program is just about the maturity of our products, Ella. It's pretty simple from, I would say, a natural progression of our product capabilities. You can imagine, as our products -- let's take the example of website plus marketing, where we did do a press release around APIs being available as an example. You can think of websites marketing, not only the fantastic website builder, it's sort of the number one in terms of producing the best sites. If you're building website plus marketing, it's going to build a very, very capable website for you that will perform very well in Google. But how do you sort of expand beyond the folks that are coming to you? And the natural extension is to be able to put give some of those capabilities into partner systems. And the best way to do it is through APIs. But what we have as an advantage as a company is not only exposing those APIs for website plus marketing, but we're able to leave in APIs that power other things that Airo can bring into the mix, right? So just like we're going out to customers directly, and we're exposing them to Airo and looking at discovery and engagement the reseller program or the APIs our way of trying to sort of work with partners and say, let's see what we can do given our expanded capabilities, given our expanded tool set where our product offering can show up natively in our partner experiences. Ella Smith : That makes a lot of sense. Thank you so much. Aman Bhutani : Thank you. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill from Jefferies. Brent, please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, thank you. This is Chand [ph] on for Brent Thill. Two questions. One, as you made the Airo available in over 180 countries, just wondering if you could talk about what's been, how the response has been different versus, let's say the initial launch within the U.S. Any sort of change difference in behavior or attach? And then the second question is around the normalized EBITDA margin. Obviously, that's been expanding faster than expected. And your goal is still 33% in '26. So it seems like that looks very likely to overshoot that. Wondering if there are any factors why that may not be, why we shouldn't be extrapolating from here? Thank you. Aman Bhutani : Yes. Maybe I can take the first one, and Mark, you can take the second one. So on the launch of Airo, John, the way we look at it is that we've got the U.S. market, which is obviously where we started in our largest market, and we've shared some of the data with you on how well that is going. The next stage is the English-speaking markets. These are our bigger markets around the world, just what you would expect them to be like Canada, U.K., Australia, right? And then we have a set of developed markets and, I would say, emerging markets. And it's too early to talk about sort of those emerging markets. And how Airo is going to perform there. It's still relatively new as an off rate. But in the broader English-speaking markets, we're actually taking the learnings from the U.S. and looking to apply them in all the other English-speaking markets. And of course, we expect it to perform maybe not exactly the same, but at a similar level in those markets. Mark McCaffrey : And then I'll just -- on the normalized EBITDA, we've talked about the three buckets that are a tailwind to get us to the 33% in 2026. We've talked about the acceleration of A&C being a big part of the picture. We've talked about the infrastructure simplifications. We also talked about the global talent pools. We're really happy on our accomplishments, especially around some of the front-loaded elements of this. If you remember, we took restructurings last year that now are really showing up into our expansion of normalized EBITDA this year. Some of that was front-end loaded. So we'll start to see continued benefit in those three buckets to get to the 33%. We feel really comfortable with that. But we did see some of that front-loaded related to the restructuring. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you very much. Christie Masoner : Our next question comes from the line of Chris Zhang from UBS. Chris, please go ahead. Aman Bhutani : Chris? Chris Zhang : There's a button to click. All right thanks for taking our question. So how do we think about -- how should we think about your investment needs in 2025 versus 2024 in addition to the market investments? Can you maybe just rank order a couple of areas you're focusing on next year? And then I have a follow-up? Mark McCaffrey : Well, Chris, we'll talk about 2025, when we get to Q4 earnings. No doubtedly we'll give some details of where we think things like our investments are going to be. But there are areas we talked about on this call. Marketing is one of them. We continue to see the ability to accelerate Airo. We see the customer engagements and the behaviors around it. And then we also think about, I always say there are two important things within our growth, which is innovation and owning the customer relationship. And those are about what we spend to innovate and meet our customers' needs and things like our care organization. We see great leverage across those lines, but we'll continue to invest in what the future is to drive the long-term value. Aman Bhutani : Yes. Maybe just add to this quick short summary is that our Investor Day framework is still intact, right? We're making great progress on it. We're working to maximize free cash flow and the components of it to 6% to 8% growth and 33% margin in '26. Those continue to sort of be the path. Chris Zhang : All right. Sounds great. I appreciate the color. And I guess, as it relates to marketing investments specifically, maybe can you share with us what guardrails you're applying to determine the label of your spend? Or maybe just directionally how that differs from among the various product offerings in your A&C portfolio? Aman Bhutani : Yes. On the marketing spend, we've invested in sort of very good guardrails driven by data and machine learning that gives us great commentary [ph] on our marketing spend and return on it. And our goal is to stay within our guidance range, what we're really building is the opportunity to drive more discovery for Airo, drive more engagement with Airo and get some of those returns and then be able to reinvest them back in. So it's really about sort of kickstarting that flywheel with a great product suite we have in place now. Mark McCaffrey : Yes. And our disciplined approach hasn't changed around this. It's about measuring the ROIs and making sure that we feel comfortable that where we invest, we will get that disciplined ROI we always talk about. Chris Zhang : All right. Sounds great. Thank you for your color. And look forward to seeing your team in Arizona. Aman Bhutani : You too. Mark McCaffrey : You too. Christie Masoner : The next question comes from the line of Naved Khan from B. Riley. Naved, please go ahead. Naved Khan : Yes, hi. Thanks a lot. So I got a couple of questions. One is this 40% of paid develop subscribers coming originating through Airo. That's pretty impressive. I'm just wondering how that share that comes through Airo has kind of trended over the last three or four quarters, since this Airo has been kind of live. So that's one. And the second question I have is just around the on ramps. So now that you're extending Airo into the sort of website first kind of on ramp, I'm trying to just kind of think about the relative size of the on-ramps for the business? How should -- what's the right way to think about domains versus websites. Aman Bhutani : The share for Airo over the last few months -- we're not orders. We don't have orders of data its months, right. Over the last few months have been increasing, but obviously accelerated by some of the payroll work, right. And then is going to take a couple of quarters to see how the payroll performance with our regular TAT. The number jumping to 40% is a clear signal that customers looking forward just to have and all liking it. So that is a positive. In terms of the size of the different on ramps. Ultimately what we plan to do is doing all the [indiscernible] together with Airo, right. We're trying to take these things that today are different and make them very similar for the customer and the future doesn't had what product they've bought. They actually end up being Airo. Naved Khan : Got it. I actually meant to say quarters not months, thanks for correcting me. Where do you think this could land as you continue to kind of own the offering and improve it you think it's nor the 50%, just high level thoughts there? Aman Bhutani : I think we're just starting on Airo. So we're not in the year end. We have celebrated the first year anniversary for Airo, which took us very early. I think we have [indiscernible] for Airo and just looking forward to what -- how far we can go ahead. It's frankly too early for us that we see an [indiscernible] the percentage quickly there. Naved Khan : Great, thanks so much. Christie Masoner : Our last question comes from the line of Clarke Jeffries from Piper Sandler. Clarke, please go ahead. Clarke Jeffries : Hello, thanks for taking the questions. So first, I wanted to ask about specifically a call out in the prepared remarks about the 46% of EBITDA margin A&C being driven by the strength of high gross margin proprietary solutions. I just wanted to ask, is that principally website and marketing? Or is there any other kind of driver in that bucket of proprietary solutions? And then as a follow-up, there is a pretty notable market event in the last quarter, a disagreement between a Managed WordPress vendor and the largest contributor to WordPress. Aman, do you see that as largely irrelevant to the long-term progress WordPress? Have you seen any kind of conversation in your customers or partners that have reacted to that out to that event? Any kind of thoughts on that would be really appreciated. Thank you. Aman Bhutani : Yes. Happy to take that. And you generally knew about it correctly in terms of the high margin products, the proprietary systems the ones we build and [Technical Difficulty] higher margin. And then the third-party products that we still tend to be a little bit lower margin rate versus the first step. Now if you sort of stack them together, of course, websites with marketing ranks very, very high in the -- all of that work is done internally, and we're able to sort of put that product forward in a very, very competitive manner. In terms of the broader question about WordPress, as you are aware, WordPress is the largest content management system in the world, right, over 40% of websites run on it. I give tremendous credit to everyone that's part of that immense success story. And we as GoDaddy we are the top 3 or top 5 contributor to WordPress depending on how you calculate contributions. There's a bunch of public data on it. So we are for the WordPress community. We are part of the WordPress community, and we believe that WordPress is here to stay. Our focus really is to build magical experiences on top of WordPress. And I'm actually excited to show you conversational WordPress at our Investor Dinner which takes the harnesses the power and massive capability that WordPress has and allows our customers to do things with it without meeting the technical expertise to do it. So those are the things that we're really interested in is to take this massively capable platform and bring it to sort of empower our customers to sort of do amazing things with it. Clarke Jeffries : Thank you very much. Aman Bhutani : Thank you, Clarke. Christie Masoner : I'll now turn the call over to Aman for closing remarks. Aman Bhutani : Just a quick mention. Thank you to all GoDaddy employees for another great quarter, and I appreciate how everyone has worked hard and looking forward to the next few quarters and years. Thank you.",
